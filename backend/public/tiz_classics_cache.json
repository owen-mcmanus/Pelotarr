The race was originally named Grand-Prix de Plouay and, from 1989 to 2015, GP Ouest-France. It was included in the inaugural UCI ProTour in 2005 and in 2011 in its successor, the UCI World Tour. Since 2016 it is called Bretagne Classic Ouest-France.</p>\n<p>Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) timed his sprint perfectly to win the Bretagne Classic &#8211; Ouest-France 2025 in Plouay ahead of Emilien Jeanni√®re (TotalEnergies) and Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>Weather conditions that ran the gamut from violent rain to wind and ultimately to sunny skies tested the riders on a dynamic day of racing. Multiple break attempts peppered the front, but in the end, a 70-rider peloton raced downhill towards the finish line to an unexpected bunch sprint.</p>\n<p>Kooij accelerated first with De Lie in his wheel, using the slipstream to come around for the victory while Jeanni√®re came from further back and overtook Kooij just before the line.</p>\n<p>A dangerous four-rider move which included Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and 2023 winner Valentin Madouas (Groupama-FDJ) made its way off the front with 12km to go. But the lack of cooperation and a determined chase by the peloton doomed the move, with the speeding pack reeling them in just 1.1 km from the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always a difficult sprint here in Plouay, and the timing today was just perfect. I&#8217;m really happy to win here, it‚Äôs one of my favorite races on the calendar. So yeah, I&#8217;m just happy, and, thank you to my teammates for the work all the day,&#8221; De Lie said after his win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The previous years, I did maybe too much in the race, so today the plan was to ride smart and just follow the big move in the climb. And for the tactical part, [it] was more to follow the big group. My timing was just perfect. Today, I followed the wheel of Olav Kooij, and I did it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After a difficult season, De Lie has finally seen success in August, starting with a stage win and overall victory at the Renewi Tour and now the one-day French WorldTour race in Brittany. He also finished second at the ADAC Cyclassics.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last three WorldTour races, I have always been on the podium or the victory, so just a dream at this moment. So I enjoy every moment, and it&#8217;s a crazy end of year for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIn its 94th edition, the 261.7km course delivered its usual challenging course with 4,750 metres of elevation gain centred around Plouay in Brittany.</p>\n<p>The peloton finished its race on the Plouay circuit, done 1.5 times, with the Rostervel climb 9km from the finish. The legendary Lezot climb was the penultimate obstacle to overcome 4km from the finish before the short climb to Kerscoulic.</p>\n<p>The first half of the race saw an early breakaway of five riders, which included √ìscar Rodriguez (Ineos Grenadiers), Silvan Dillier (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), and Iker Montegi and Andoni Lopez de Abetxuko (both Euskaltel-Euskadi), build a lead of up to five minutes over the peloton. Though Lopez de Abetxuko lost contact, the move continued before being caught inside of 90 km, leading to a series of attacks.</p>\n<p>As a short and violent downpour hit, Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Cian Uijtdebroeks (Visma-Lease a Bike), Afonso Eulalio (Bahrain Victorious) and Montegi went on the attack with Fabian Weiss (Tudor) and Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-Quickstep) bridging up, but the peloton chased hard to bring them back with 94km to go. More attacks quickly followed, with UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike especially aggressive at the front. Their efforts briefly split the bunch, but a regrouping occurred as the pace eased with 88km to go.</p>\n<p>Using the narrow roads winding through a small village, Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-Easypost) attacked with 73km to go, and quickly established a gap as the peloton spread across the road to stop any other riders from making their way across to the lone attacker.</p>\n<p>After gaining a maximum lead of 1:45 with 64km to go, Lotto took control of the peloton to keep the gap hovering around the one-minute mark. Inside of 50km to go, Tudor, TotalEnergies and Red Bull‚ÄìBora-Hansgrohe squads moved en masse to the front of the peloton, still surprisingly large in number.</p>\n<p>The next phase of racing was ignited by Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) with a massive acceleration, but he was quickly brought back by the Tudor team. UAE‚Äôs Tim Wellens put the hammer down at the front of the stretched-out field, shelling riders off the back, as the gap to Asgreen quickly tumbled down until the Dane was reabsorbed with 35km to go.</p>\n<p>Jostling for position caused a few brief splits on the C√¥te de Marta, a short kicker with 27km to go, leading to more attacks with eight riders managing to escape. Once again, McNulty was in the move in addition to Mauro Schmid, Ewen Costiou (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), Alexandre Delettre (Totalenergies), Simone Velasco (XDS Astana), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck), and Krists Neilands (Israel-Premier Tech). But, once again, the move would be reeled back in 8km later.</p>\n<p>Attacks continued at the front, causing splits in the peloton with Madouas getting a small gap inside of 13km to go. He would soon be joined by McNulty, Van Gils and Barr√©. The quartet established a maximum gap of 27 seconds before Barr√© attacked at the bottom of the C√¥te de Lezot with 5km to go.</p>\n<p>But the peloton, with Cofidis and Visma at the front, would not let the break go, leading to the bunch sprint in Plouay.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=22&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=22&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Irishman had to sit down and fight all the way to the line, but as the line arrived, he just held on, taking his first WorldTour win at 30 ahead of the sprint field.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2005, the race is organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. Established in 1924 as Circuito de Getxo, since 2001 it is also held as Memorial Ricardo Otxoa in memory of former cyclist Ricardo Otxoa, who died after a car hit him and his twin brother, Javier in early 2001.</p>\n<p>Having been comprehensively beaten at yesterday&#8217;s Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n, UAE Team Emirates-XRG were keen to avoid a second consecutive defeat in the Basque Country, as they went all-out for the win at Circuito de Getxo with Isaac del Toro, who emerged victorious after going solo on the final climb of the Alto de Pike.</p>\n<p>The Emirati outfit dominated the race, controlling on the front of the peloton throughout the day to set up the 21-year-old Mexican rider&#8217;s decisive attack with 17km to go. Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) played a key role in helping to launch the move, as he brought back the breakaway and strung out the group before performing the final leadout for Del Toro.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard then followed the subsequent counter-attacks that followed and managed to outsprint local Basque rider Alex Aranburu (Cofidis) in the finale for second place to secure a one-two finish for UAE Team Emirates-XRG.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAfter a really hard day yesterday in San Sebasti√°n, we find again the good legs like the last weeks. Yesterday was super good, and today also with the team, the guys are trying to fight super well. It is something I am super proud to be part of,&#8221; Del Toro said in his post-race interview.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThanks to the guys, me and Juan are able to fight [for the win] again, and try to do again first and second. It was a super nice day for us, we suffered with the heat and also with the level of the race, but we enjoyed today and we suffered until the end.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How It Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 80th edition of the Circuito de Getxo featured a 172.2km-long route and began with a ten-rider breakaway going up the road. They were kept on a small gap by the peloton, with UAE Team Emirates-XRG doing the majority of the work in the peloton throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The lead group fractured as the race began to enter its closing stages, and as their time gap began to diminish, a small group containing Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek), Orluis Aular (Movistar) and Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) attacked across from the peloton with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>The trio worked well with the members of the early breakaway and injected a new lease of life into the group, but Simmons and Aular ultimately proved too strong for the rest, as they went clear with just over 30km to go.</p>\n<p>Amongst all of this, UAE Team Emirates-XRG had continued to keep the breakaway close at hand, and it was not long before they were in sight of Simmons and Aular at the head of the race, catching them at the foot of the Alto de Pike with around 17km to go.</p>\n<p>Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) then wasted no time in making his decisive attack, using the pace set by his teammate Juan Ayuso to launch his move, which nobody was able to follow.</p>\n<p>Alex Aranburu (Cofidis) was briefly able to keep the Mexican rider within reach, but was unable to maintain his effort and dropped back to Ayuso, with the pair then being joined by the Lidl-Trek duo of Toms Skuji≈Ü≈° and H√©ctor √Ålvarez on the descent, but with the UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider in the group, it was difficult for them to get cooperation.</p>\n<p>Del Toro then held his advantage and time trialled his way to the finish, winning comfortably ahead of the chasing group. Meanwhile, Aranburu attacked on the uphill rise to the finish, but was matched by Ayuso, who then outsprinted him at the line to narrowly snatch second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=202&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=202&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the most important one-day race in the Basque Country and in Spain, is considered a one-day race of great prestige, just behind the &#8216;Monuments&#8217;, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking.

It includes the tough Jaizkibel and Erlaitz climbs, usually the decisive points of the race.</p>\n<p>After surviving an onslaught of attacks on the final climbs, Giulio Ciccone emerged as the strongest rider on the day with an incredible move to go solo on the final climb of Murgil-Tontorra to win the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n.</p>\n<p>The UAE Team Emirates-XRG duo of Jan Christen and Isaac del Toro looked to have the beating of the Italian with the numerical advantage firmly in their favour, but neither were strong enough to dislodge the Lidl-Trek rider, who then launched his decisive attack with 8.8km to go.</p>\n<p>He went solo over the top of the climb, taking risks to extend his advantage on the descent, and though it looked like he may have been tiring as he entered the final kilometre, he just had enough to hold on to his slender advantage and take the biggest one-day race victory of his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was the moment I took to go full gas, I saw Del Toro was dropping and [Jan] Christen was coming from the back, so this was the moment to try. I think in the end it was the right decision,&#8221; Ciccone said of his attack over the final ascent, reiterating how much this victory means to him in a post-race interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is something special. After the crash at the Giro, it was not easy to continue with the same morale. Mentally, it was a hard moment for me, especially for the team. I had two weeks off, and I realised it was the moment to come back stronger than before,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need to say thanks to the team and my teammates. They pushed a lot for me. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t expect that I would be able to win today. I&#8217;m happy to have these legs and to have the same shape that I had in the Giro before the crash.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing on the shores of the Bay of Biscay in San Sebasti√°n, the 44th edition of the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n saw the riders take on a 211.4km-long route around the north of the Spanish Basque Country.</p>\n<p>The day began with a twelve-rider breakaway going up the road after around 5km of racing, with Jordan Labrosse (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Paul Double (Jayco AlUla) and Mats Wenzel (Equipo Kern Pharma) among them. The group worked together for the majority of the day, until they hit the foot of the Alto de Jaizkibel, where gaps began to open up.</p>\n<p>Labrosse was the strongest on the climb, with Wenzel the last to be distanced by the Frenchman. However, the main action came when Luke Plapp (Jayco AlUla) launched an attack from the peloton and bridged across to Double, who put in a big effort to close the gap for his teammate before the Australian rider accelerated again.</p>\n<p>Plapp joined up with Wenzel over the top of the climb, and the pair worked well together on the descent to close the gap to Labrosse, before catching the lone leader with 52km to go. The trio then worked together on the 7km-long flat section before the beginning of the Erlaitz climb, where Plapp quickly left his breakaway companions behind.</p>\n<p>The attacks then began behind, as Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) accelerated to whittle down the main group. The Slovenian drew Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) clear with him, but they were quickly rejoined by other riders as they closed the gap to Plapp.</p>\n<p>As the Australian rider was caught, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) moved to the front of the group and launched an attack at just under 44km to go, as Rogliƒç and Christen followed him along with their respective teammates, Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>Around a kilometre later, it was Del Toro&#8217;s turn to launch a move with only a few hundred metres to go until the top of the climb. Ciccone stayed glued to the Mexican rider&#8217;s wheel and followed the move, with the others in the group unable to do the same.</p>\n<p>The pair quickly established a lead over the chasers, who grew in size and strength as the terrain levelled off. However, with so many different teams represented, they struggled to get much cooperation in the group, allowing the gap to go out to nearly a minute.</p>\n<p>Ciccone and Del Toro continued to work well together on the descent and the subsequent flat section, but their gap never went above the minute mark, as Rogliƒç fully committed himself to the chase behind in service of Van Gils.</p>\n<p>As they hit the lower slopes of the Murgil-Tontorra climb with around 10km to go, Jan Christen attacked from the chasing and punched his way across the gap to the leading duo. When he reached them, he went straight over the top and on the attack again, with Ciccone immediately jumping on the wheel, whilst Del Toro was unable to follow the move and began to drift backwards.</p>\n<p>However, the young Swiss rider may have misjudged his effort, as Ciccone then counter-attacked him as soon as he noticed that he was in a bit of difficulty to open up a gap and go solo.</p>\n<p>Once he was over the top of the climb, the Italian rider began the descent towards the finish with around ten seconds of a lead. He took several risks on the downhill section and had some near misses as he pushed the limits in an attempt to extend his advantage, with Christen doing the same to try and close the gap.</p>\n<p>As they came off the descent, it seemed a near-certainty that Ciccone would win, but he still had to maintain his effort all the way until the finish, and though he looked to be tiring slightly in the closing kilometres, the gap was just too much for an equally tired Christen to close.</p>\n<p>After proving himself to be the strongest rider on the day, Giulio Ciccone crossed the line eight seconds ahead of Christen to win the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n, whilst Van Gils won the sprint behind for third place ahead of Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Del Toro.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I had two weeks off, and I realised it was the moment to come back stronger than before,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need to say thanks to the team and my teammates. They pushed a lot for me. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t expect that I would be able to win today. I&#8217;m happy to have these legs and to have the same shape that I had in the Giro before the crash.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing on the shores of the Bay of Biscay in San Sebasti√°n, the 44th edition of the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n saw the riders take on a 211.4km-long route around the north of the Spanish Basque Country.</p>\n<p>The day began with a twelve-rider breakaway going up the road after around 5km of racing, with Jordan Labrosse (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Paul Double (Jayco AlUla) and Mats Wenzel (Equipo Kern Pharma) among them. The group worked together for the majority of the day, until they hit the foot of the Alto de Jaizkibel, where gaps began to open up.</p>\n<p>Labrosse was the strongest on the climb, with Wenzel the last to be distanced by the Frenchman. However, the main action came when Luke Plapp (Jayco AlUla) launched an attack from the peloton and bridged across to Double, who put in a big effort to close the gap for his teammate before the Australian rider accelerated again.</p>\n<p>Plapp joined up with Wenzel over the top of the climb, and the pair worked well together on the descent to close the gap to Labrosse, before catching the lone leader with 52km to go. The trio then worked together on the 7km-long flat section before the beginning of the Erlaitz climb, where Plapp quickly left his breakaway companions behind.</p>\n<p>The attacks then began behind, as Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) accelerated to whittle down the main group. The Slovenian drew Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) clear with him, but they were quickly rejoined by other riders as they closed the gap to Plapp.</p>\n<p>As the Australian rider was caught, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) moved to the front of the group and launched an attack at just under 44km to go, as Rogliƒç and Christen followed him along with their respective teammates, Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>Around a kilometre later, it was Del Toro&#8217;s turn to launch a move with only a few hundred metres to go until the top of the climb. Ciccone stayed glued to the Mexican rider&#8217;s wheel and followed the move, with the others in the group unable to do the same.</p>\n<p>The pair quickly established a lead over the chasers, who grew in size and strength as the terrain levelled off. However, with so many different teams represented, they struggled to get much cooperation in the group, allowing the gap to go out to nearly a minute.</p>\n<p>Ciccone and Del Toro continued to work well together on the descent and the subsequent flat section, but their gap never went above the minute mark, as Rogliƒç fully committed himself to the chase behind in service of Van Gils.</p>\n<p>As they hit the lower slopes of the Murgil-Tontorra climb with around 10km to go, Jan Christen attacked from the chasing and punched his way across the gap to the leading duo. When he reached them, he went straight over the top and on the attack again, with Ciccone immediately jumping on the wheel, whilst Del Toro was unable to follow the move and began to drift backwards.</p>\n<p>However, the young Swiss rider may have misjudged his effort, as Ciccone then counter-attacked him as soon as he noticed that he was in a bit of difficulty to open up a gap and go solo.</p>\n<p>Once he was over the top of the climb, the Italian rider began the descent towards the finish with around ten seconds of a lead. He took several risks on the downhill section and had some near misses as he pushed the limits in an attempt to extend his advantage, with Christen doing the same to try and close the gap.</p>\n<p>As they came off the descent, it seemed a near-certainty that Ciccone would win, but he still had to maintain his effort all the way until the finish, and though he looked to be tiring slightly in the closing kilometres, the gap was just too much for an equally tired Christen to close.</p>\n<p>After proving himself to be the strongest rider on the day, Giulio Ciccone crossed the line eight seconds ahead of Christen to win the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n, whilst Van Gils won the sprint behind for third place ahead of Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Del Toro.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The festivities will start in Roskilde and climax with a spectacular circuit through the streets of Copenhagen, where the riders will race for victory. Copenhagen Sprint will be a celebration of cycling and cycling culture. In addition to world-class cycling, Copenhagen Sprint will offer a wide selection of activities that will engage, inspire and bring us together. There will be activities for everyone, including a wide selection of side events, including a free ride for the public on the closed circuit in Copenhagen and a bicycle festival. In addition, Copenhagen, together with a broad national circle of partners, will host a political cycling summit that will set the framework for new strategic collaborations that can promote everyday cycling in Denmark and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Jordi Meeus (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was the fastest in a chaotic sprint to win the new Copenhagen Sprint WorldTour race on Sunday in Denmark. The Belgian crossed the line ahead of runner-up Alexis Renard (Cofidis) and third-placed Emilien Jeanni√®re (Team TotalEnergies).</p>\n<p>On Friday Meeus won stage 6 of the Tour de Suisse, on Saturday he opted not to start the Tour de Suisse, was given permission to ride in Denmark and so jumped on an airplane to fill in for an injury-hit team. On Sunday afternoon, he won the hectic race in central Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>Meeus, Renard, and Page were part of a chasing peloton that caught the attackers after a late crash, that involved Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike), and which split the field inside 10km to go. The crash sparked significant disorganisation in the teams hoping to lead-out for their sprinters and Meeus took advantage.</p>\n<p>Among those still in the front group of around 50 riders were also Dylan Groenewegen (Team Jayco AlUla), Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) and Arnaud D√©mare (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels). Groenewegen launched his sprint first inside 300 metres to go, but faded and was forced to settle for seventh place on the day as a faster Meeus passed him at the line.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAfter six tough days of racing in Switzerland, I felt a bit tired, but I still had some power left in the legs.

Copenhagen Sprint will be a celebration of cycling and cycling culture. In addition to world-class cycling, Copenhagen Sprint will offer a wide selection of activities that will engage, inspire and bring us together. There will be activities for everyone, including a wide selection of side events, including a free ride for the public on the closed circuit in Copenhagen and a bicycle festival.

The crowds were amazing, in every town there were so many people cheering for us, and in the city centre, so many people came out and watched us, it‚Äôs special,‚Äù said Wiebes after her 104th professional victory.</p>\n<p>The European champion was never out of position on the final lap and Guarischi gave her a world-class lead-out.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to adjust a bit because we were missing one rider [Blanka Vas]. I let somebody in between Barbara Guarischi and me. She did a really, really strong lead-out; she was putting me in a perfect position. I started a bit early, but it was better than going too late,‚Äù Wiebes said, describing the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFrom the sign-in and start in Roskilde, the peloton faced a 151km course, snaking through North Zealand before reaching the Danish capital and finishing with three laps of a 10.3km circuit in the city centre and the N√∏rrebro quarter.</p>\n<p>Along the way, there were three town sprints counting for a separate classification, and Meis Poland (VolkerWessels) attacked just before Frederikssund to win the first one. She then became part of a breakaway of four that formed with 110km to go, the other three riders being Julia Borgstr√∂m (AG Insurance-Soudal), Britt de Grave (DD Group), and April Tacey (Coop-Repsol).</p>\n<p>They were just over a minute ahead with 80km to go. Poland tried to go for the second town sprint in Ganl√∏se but was outsprinted by Tacey, Borgstr√∂m, and De Grave. A large central reservation then caused a crash in the peloton that took down over a dozen riders, including Balsamo and four of her Lidl-Trek teammates. Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Cindy Pomares (CJ O‚ÄôShea), and Nora Tveit (DAS-Hutchinson) had to abandon the race.</p>\n<p>Only a few kilometres later, there was a second crash as a rider hit the protective haybale tied to a bollard head-on. Again, around a dozen riders went down, and Elynor B√§ckstedt (UAE Team ADQ), Romy Kasper, Daria Pikulik, and her sister Wiktoria Pikulik (all Human Powered Health) could not continue.</p>\n<p>With 50km to go and the peloton bearing down on the breakaway, only 25 seconds behind, Poland tried to get away in order to reach the final town sprint. She dropped De Grave and Borgstr√∂m, but Tacey jumped across and soon dropped Poland herself.</p>\n<p>Tacey won the final town sprint in R√∏dovre, but the peloton then reeled her in on the hill of Valby Bakke. On the city centre circuit, the sprinters‚Äô teams controlled proceedings, keeping the pace high enough to discourage any attacks, and a big peloton entered the final lap together.</p>\n<p>Danish champion Rebecca Koerner (Uno-X Mobility) and Georgia Baker (Liv AlUla Jayco) crashed as they turned left onto the cobbles of Adelgade with 8.5km to go. Although only two riders hit the deck, this crash split the peloton as many riders were held up, and the speed was high on the final lap.</p>\n<p>Only some 30 riders remained in front, and although more riders got back on, it was a reduced peloton that entered the final kilometres. Picnic PostNL surged to the front at the 2km mark, entering the right-hand turn into N√∏rre All√© at the front with Josie Nelson, Pfeiffer Georgi, and Megan Jastrab ahead of Kool.</p>\n<p>Georgi led the field through the penultimate turn on Skt. Hans Torv but was too strong for Jastrab, who had to leave a small gap. At the flamme rouge, Lidl-Trek came alongside with Fleur Moors and Clara Copponi leading out Balsamo, and Guarischi jumped from Kool‚Äôs wheel to that of Moors to get the optimal line through the final corner for herself and Wiebes.</p>\n<p>On the 900-metre finishing straight, Georgi was still pulling at the front with the Lidl-Trek train on her wheel until Guarischi began her lead-out on Fredens Bro with 550 metres to go. Kool was in Guarischi‚Äôs wheel, followed by Wiebes, who had Balsamo and Consonni jostling for position behind her.</p>\n<p>Wiebes started her sprint 200 metres from the line, and Kool hesitated briefly before launching herself. Consonni and Balsamo went after Wiebes right away but were no match for her acceleration, and Wiebes won the sprint by several bike lengths.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24059&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24059&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In addition, Copenhagen, together with a broad national circle of partners, will host a political cycling summit that will set the framework for new strategic collaborations that can promote everyday cycling in Denmark and the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) left no doubt as to who is the best sprinter in the women&#8217;s peloton, winning the Copenhagen Sprint by several bike lengths.</p>\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) took second place while Chiara Consonni (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) just edged out Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL) for third place.</p>\n<p>After an early break had been brought back, there were no attacks on the three laps of the finishing circuit in the centre of Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>A crash on the final lap split the peloton, and Wiebes was led out perfectly by her teammate Barbara Guarischi to win the sprint.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt feels really great, it was a nice race. The crowds were amazing, in every town there were so many people cheering for us, and in the city centre, so many people came out and watched us, it‚Äôs special,‚Äù said Wiebes after her 104th professional victory.</p>\n<p>The European champion was never out of position on the final lap and Guarischi gave her a world-class lead-out.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to adjust a bit because we were missing one rider [Blanka Vas]. I let somebody in between Barbara Guarischi and me. She did a really, really strong lead-out; she was putting me in a perfect position. I started a bit early, but it was better than going too late,‚Äù Wiebes said, describing the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFrom the sign-in and start in Roskilde, the peloton faced a 151km course, snaking through North Zealand before reaching the Danish capital and finishing with three laps of a 10.3km circuit in the city centre and the N√∏rrebro quarter.</p>\n<p>Along the way, there were three town sprints counting for a separate classification, and Meis Poland (VolkerWessels) attacked just before Frederikssund to win the first one. She then became part of a breakaway of four that formed with 110km to go, the other three riders being Julia Borgstr√∂m (AG Insurance-Soudal), Britt de Grave (DD Group), and April Tacey (Coop-Repsol).</p>\n<p>They were just over a minute ahead with 80km to go. Poland tried to go for the second town sprint in Ganl√∏se but was outsprinted by Tacey, Borgstr√∂m, and De Grave. A large central reservation then caused a crash in the peloton that took down over a dozen riders, including Balsamo and four of her Lidl-Trek teammates. Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Cindy Pomares (CJ O‚ÄôShea), and Nora Tveit (DAS-Hutchinson) had to abandon the race.</p>\n<p>Only a few kilometres later, there was a second crash as a rider hit the protective haybale tied to a bollard head-on. Again, around a dozen riders went down, and Elynor B√§ckstedt (UAE Team ADQ), Romy Kasper, Daria Pikulik, and her sister Wiktoria Pikulik (all Human Powered Health) could not continue.</p>\n<p>With 50km to go and the peloton bearing down on the breakaway, only 25 seconds behind, Poland tried to get away in order to reach the final town sprint. She dropped De Grave and Borgstr√∂m, but Tacey jumped across and soon dropped Poland herself.</p>\n<p>Tacey won the final town sprint in R√∏dovre, but the peloton then reeled her in on the hill of Valby Bakke. On the city centre circuit, the sprinters‚Äô teams controlled proceedings, keeping the pace high enough to discourage any attacks, and a big peloton entered the final lap together.</p>\n<p>Danish champion Rebecca Koerner (Uno-X Mobility) and Georgia Baker (Liv AlUla Jayco) crashed as they turned left onto the cobbles of Adelgade with 8.5km to go. Although only two riders hit the deck, this crash split the peloton as many riders were held up, and the speed was high on the final lap.</p>\n<p>Only some 30 riders remained in front, and although more riders got back on, it was a reduced peloton that entered the final kilometres. Picnic PostNL surged to the front at the 2km mark, entering the right-hand turn into N√∏rre All√© at the front with Josie Nelson, Pfeiffer Georgi, and Megan Jastrab ahead of Kool.</p>\n<p>Georgi led the field through the penultimate turn on Skt. Hans Torv but was too strong for Jastrab, who had to leave a small gap. At the flamme rouge, Lidl-Trek came alongside with Fleur Moors and Clara Copponi leading out Balsamo, and Guarischi jumped from Kool‚Äôs wheel to that of Moors to get the optimal line through the final corner for herself and Wiebes.</p>\n<p>On the 900-metre finishing straight, Georgi was still pulling at the front with the Lidl-Trek train on her wheel until Guarischi began her lead-out on Fredens Bro with 550 metres to go. Kool was in Guarischi‚Äôs wheel, followed by Wiebes, who had Balsamo and Consonni jostling for position behind her.</p>\n<p>Wiebes started her sprint 200 metres from the line, and Kool hesitated briefly before launching herself. Consonni and Balsamo went after Wiebes right away but were no match for her acceleration, and Wiebes won the sprint by several bike lengths.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24059&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24059&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I am really happy to finish it off this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first edition of the Classique Dunkerque / Grand Prix des Hauts de France began in the coastal town of Dunkirk in northern France and headed south for a hilly finishing loop to cover Mont des Rocollets and Notre Dame de Lorette twice each before a flat finish in Lens.</p>\n<p>Straightaway from the start in Dunkerque, a small group of riders formed the breakaway of the day, comprised of a trio of Belgian riders ‚Äì Abram Stockman (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Luca De Meester (Wagner Bazin WB), Kenny Molly (Van Rysel Roubaix) ‚Äì and a Frenchman, Similien Hamon (CIC-U-Nantes).</p>\n<p>Across the opening 50km on mainly flat roads to the south, the quartet stretched their lead to just over 7 minutes once across the forest of five classified climbs on the day, the first one at Estr√©e-Blanche with 123.5km to go.</p>\n<p>A block of 47 more flat kilometres allowed the group the freedom to snatch up intermediate sprint points, but the peloton wiped away half of their time advantage.</p>\n<p>The crest of the longest climb, 2.9km Mont des Recollets at 3.8%, signalled the final 46km of racing and a series of three more climbs approaching. The advantage to the breakaway of four riders was down to 25 seconds, the pace in the peloton dictated by Ineos Grenadiers and Picnic-PostNL, two of the 11 WorldTeams in the field.</p>\n<p>Once on the steep banks of Notre Dame de Lorette, 1.1km at 7.6%, for the second of two passes, Stockman accelerated away from his companions on a solo effort, but it didn&#8217;t last long as work by WorldTour squads Intermarch√©-Wanty and Cofidis came to the front before the final intermediate sprint in Vimy, with 20km to go.</p>\n<p>Heavy rain for the next 5km slowed the pace enough to allow a split in the peloton to fade and allowed all the sprint teams to reposition for the run-in to Lens.</p>\n<p>In the final 10km, Soudal-QuickStep joined Cofidis at the front on the wide roads into the metropolitan area. On a small incline with 7km to go, Axel Huens (Unibet Tietema Rockets) attacked at the front, but Cofidis reacted and strung out the peloton. A small curb on the twisting roads caused a domino effect, with a handful of riders going down.</p>\n<p>Cofidis continued at the front, the rain well behind them, with an obstacle course of more road furniture scattered on the dry roads, and the front group dwindled to a small selection of about 40 riders.</p>\n<p>Israel-Premier Tech set up the sprint train for Pascal Ackermann in the final kilometre, with the German finding an opening on the right side to take the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24917&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24917&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is a 1-day amateur test that runs through the municipality of Eibar and its neighbors. It is usually done around April each year. Under the organization of the Club Ciclista Eibarr√©s it began in 1972 and since then it has been positioned as one of the most prestigious events of the Spanish amateur calendar being scoring for the Spanish Cup. In its route it includes ports such as the high of Elgueta, Ixua or San Miguel.</p>\n<p>Catalan David Dom√≠nguez (Zamora Enamora) has won the 52nd edition of the Memorial Valenciaga after a formidable attack with three kilometres to go, with which he managed to release his two breakaway companions, Iker Mintegi (Laboral Kutxa), second at the finish line, and Jorge Guti√©rrez ( Finisher) from Extremadura , third in Eibar.</p>\n<p>Xabier Aransolo (Jira-Bira) was one of the first early attempts at forming a breakaway, although his solitary attempt didn&#8217;t go very far and soon after a breakaway of twelve riders was formed that would ride together for around 50 kilometres. That leading group, made up of I√±aki Trujillo (Eiser), Carlos Collazos (High Level), Jason Huertas (Louri√±a), I√±aki D√≠az (Laboral Kutxa), Joan Riera (Arabay Vas), Alejandro Granados and Jon Ibarluzea (Telco&#8217;m On), Jos√© Hern√°ndez (Zamora Enamora), Aitor Garmendia (Eibar), Daniel Jim√©nez (Super Froiz) and Kimetz Etxabe (Baqu√©), later broke in two after a selection took place on the Ixua slopes.</p>\n<p>√âdgar Cadena (Telco) and David Dom√≠nguez (Zamora Enamora) emerged as the best on the climb to Ixua, effectively ending the breakaway. With Cadena losing ground at San Miguel, Jorge Guti√©rrez (Finisher) and Iker Mintegi (Laboral Kutxa) managed to consolidate a gap with Dom√≠nguez in the final ten kilometers, with a gap of almost a minute over their pursuers, who lacked the necessary understanding to catch up.</p>\n<p>Finally, David Dom√≠nguez raised his arms in the final recovery in the historic center of Eibar after an attack in the last three kilometers that surprised Guti√©rrez, who had previously tested it, and Iker Mintegui.</p>\n<p>Ricardo Zurita (Padron√©s) remains the elite leader, while Uruguayan Thomas Silva (Caja Rural) remains at the top of the U-23 standings.</p>\n<p>Thomas Silva (Caja Rural): &#8220;We knew we were facing a very tough race due to the route and the weather, but the whole team was very confident of doing well. There was a break at the start with no one in the lead, but Ib√°√±ez did an exceptional job controlling the peloton. On the passes through Elgeta and Ixua, we were able to make a good climb with Garchu, Arriola, and Samu selecting from the bottom. When the three who eventually finished broke away, we couldn&#8217;t be there, but we scored good points for the overall standings and we have to continue like this to defend our lead.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Iker Mintegi (Laboral Kutxa): &#8220;The day was very tough, especially because of the weather. The team did very well, holding their position to avoid the danger of crashes, especially on the descents. In Ixua, the race was decided, I caught the frontrunners, and in San Miguel, we went full throttle. We were three in the lead and started attacking each other with a kilometer and a half to go. In the end, I finished second, and I&#8217;m very satisfied.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1234&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1234&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Among those missing out on the lead group were Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor), and Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain Victorious), and Jayco-AlUla kept the pace high to make sure the rest couldn&#8217;t rejoin over the next 50 kilometres.</p>\n<p>On the final trip over the Mammolshain, Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) put in a surge to try to further decimate the peloton along with Albert Withen Philipsen (Lidl-Trek).

Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe joined in the pace-making with 10km to go but Uno-X quickly resumed control with confidence.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian team led out into the final kilometre with Cort in prime position, but Matthews was keen to their tactic and powered past Cort to claim the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=35&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=35&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour. The equivalent men&#8217;s race is a cycling monument.</p>\n<p>The 2025 Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge Femmes came down to four riders in a mad dash to the line in the Belgian Ardennes with Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) making history as Mauritian national champion.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old beat Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), and Cedrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) on the line. </p>\n<p>After being dropped a few times, Le Court found her rhythm on the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons, and was able to bridge up to Vollering and Pieterse.

When I bridged to them I saw they were really suffering, of course I was suffering too but for me to make that effort to bridge to them I knew I had maybe a bit more legs,&#8221; Le Court said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t know [that I could win] until I got to the sprint and I just kicked and I just never looked back. I could see I think Puck&#8217;s wheel, but yeah, I just didn&#8217;t stop.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been always so close this whole season and I&#8217;ve actually aimed for Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge this whole season. It&#8217;s been really the last classics I really wanted to win, so I can&#8217;t believe we made it all together as a team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOn the ninth running of the women&#8217;s Liege-Bastogne-Liege, the riders started in the Place McAuliffe, Bastogne, with a star-studded peloton heading to Li√®ge.</p>\n<p>The race started in the town of Bastogne with a course of 152.9km heading to Liege. There were three non-starters, Debora Silvestri (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), Julie Vlyminck (DD Grou) and Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>There was one group of five riders that tried to make an early breakaway, but they were caught just a few minutes after forming.</p>\n<p>A nasty crash early on saw both Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ) and Liane Lippert (Movistar) come down, with the former being forced to abandon a few moments later, just after the first of 10 classified climbs, the C√¥te de Saint-Roch.</p>\n<p>Three riders got a gap on the peloton with just under 130km to go they were Tiril J√∏rgensen (Coop-Repsol), Constance Valentin (Winspace-Orange-Seal) and Victoire Guilman (Cofidis), with Laura Molenaar (VolkerWessels) going for a bridge. They quickly got over a minute. </p>\n<p>Another counter move went away with Solbj√∏rk Minke Anderson (Uno-X Mobility), Fariba Hashimi (Ceratizit), Sylvie Swinkels (Roland) and Danielle De Francesco (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) getting a gap. All three groups came together with 112km to go, forming an eight-rider group which held a maximum gap of four minutes. </p>\n<p>The breakaway was dragged back after it lost cohesion with just over 70km to go, with FDJ-Suez controlling the peloton for their leader, Demi Vollering. </p>\n<p>More moves came and went, Maeva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) was one of the riders who did get away with 50km to go. She pulled out over a minute on the bunch. As the gap began to close, Valentina Cavallar (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) launched a counter move to try and bridge. </p>\n<p>Both were caught just before and during the infamous C√¥te de la Redoute with a major shock with Italian champion, Elisa Longo-Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), getting dropped on the climb. </p>\n<p>A group of 15 riders went clear on the C√¥te de la Redoute. The big favourites didn&#8217;t commit to any attacks with just over 30km to go, and multiple riders rejoined. </p>\n<p>Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck) launched a move on the flat after the descent and got a small gap with Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto) and Kerbaol joining the Dutch climber at the front of the race. </p>\n<p>FDJ-Suez did set a good tempo in the chase, but then Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease A Bike) tried a move which was marked. Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) pushed hard and started working hard to bring the leaders back.</p>\n<p>Up front, Kerbaol launched on a small descent, using her amazing technical ability. However, Niedermaier was quick to drag her back to reform the group of four. They had over 20 seconds with 20km to go. </p>\n<p>Movistar went all out to try and bring the leaders back before the final climb of the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons. Van der Breggen and Kerbaol held on for the longes but Rooijakkers dropped back to bring her teammate, Puck Pieterse up to the front along with Kopecky and Vollering.</p>\n<p>Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto), Marlen Reusser (Movistar) and the rest all left behind. </p>\n<p>Vollering used the steepest gradients to try and drop Kopecky. However, the world champion held on along with Pieterse and Kerbaol. Despite the infernal pace by Vollering, Kopecky managed to hold on over the top of the Roche-aux-Faucons with a gap of about 10&#8243; over the closest chaser, Reusser. </p>\n<p>Once again, using the descent, Kerbaol went clear with 12km to go as the other three riders looked at each other, and Reusser joined the chase. </p>\n<p>Just before a large chasing group joined the group of Vollering, Pieters, Kopecky and Reusser, the winner of Fleche Wallonne, Pieterse, launched. However, Le Court rejoined the main group with Kopecky and Reusser both getting dropped. </p>\n<p>Kerboal was dragged back by Vollering, Pieterse and Le Court with just over 8km to go. The French rider then sat on the back with the chasing group just around 30 seconds down. </p>\n<p>No one wanted to go early, and it all came down to a sprint with Vollering leading out. Le Court came flying off her wheel, and the extremely powerful Mauritian rider was too fast for Pieterse, with Kerbaol missing out on the podium. </p>\n<p>Kopecky led the chasing pack home 24 seconds back on the leading group in Liege. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9052&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9052&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First run in 1892, it is the oldest of the five Monuments of the European professional road cycling calendar; usually coming as the last of the spring classics. It is held annually in late April, in the Ardennes region of Belgium, from Li√®ge to Bastogne and back. It is considered one of the most arduous one-day cycling events in the world because of its length and demanding course.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) soared to his third career Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge victory with another peerless spring performance, going clear on the C√¥te de La Redoute and soloing the final 35km to take a ninth Monument win.</p>\n<p>The world champion kicked off the attacking on the famous hill, moving to the front midway up the 1.6km slope and pushing on to build a 10-second lead at the top.<br />\nAs chasing groups formed, attacked, and countered behind him, Pogaƒçar pushed on alone to build his lead to over a minute. By the final climb of the C√¥te de Roche-aux-Faucons, it was enough time in hand for victory to be certain, and he could race into Li√®ge without worries and with plenty of time to celebrate his win.</p>\n<p>Further back, a chase group made up of Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor), Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) had formed on La Redoute, while the other pre-race favourite Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) showed that he has yet to hit top form after his long injury layoff.</p>\n<p>Healy and Ciccone emerged as the strongest riders in the chase on the Roche-aux-Faucons, going clear on the 11% slopes and extending their advantage on the descent towards Li√®ge.</p>\n<p>The pair carried a 25-second lead into the final kilometres of the race, setting up a two-man battle to the finish for the two podium spots behind Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Over one minute after the world champion rolled across the line to round off six hours of racing with his 95th career victory, Healy led Ciccone into the final 500 metres, with the Italian coming around before the line to nab second place.</p>\n<p>Simone Velasco (XDS-Astana) led the larger third chase group home for fourth at 1:10 down, while Thibau Nys completed a good day for Lidl-Trek to take fifth place as the top home finisher.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt feels great to finish the first part of the season like this. I‚Äôm just happy that the whole season so far went perfect,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the plan [to attack on La Redoute], but it was such a hard pace before that, I saw a number of teams didn‚Äôt have a lot of teammates anymore. I said, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôll test my legs a little bit and see if I can get a gap on the top‚Äô, and then I‚Äôll decide if I continue or not.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen I just committed because I had good legs ‚Äì also on the second climb after La Redoute. I could go to the finish, so I‚Äôm super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe oldest Monument in cycling ran its 111th edition on Sunday, with the day featuring a 252km route spearing south from Li√®ge towards Bastogne and then back up to Li√®ge again.</p>\n<p>4,300 metres of climbing lay ahead of the riders at the start as 11 major climbs filled the route, including the C√¥te de Saint-Roch, C√¥te de Stockeu, C√¥te de Haute-Lev√©e, C√¥te de La Redoute, and the final test of the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons.</p>\n<p>The battle for the day‚Äôs breakaway began almost as soon as the flag dropped to start the race, with a 46kph average speed over the first half hour signalling the riders‚Äô intent. The break of the day was set within the first 30km as 12 men made it up the road well before the race‚Äôs first climb.</p>\n<p>Wagner Bazin WB placed three men in the move in the shape of Ceriel Desal, Johan Meens and Henri-Fran√ßois Renard-Haquin, while TotalEnergies had Rayan Boulahoite and Valentin Retailleau out front.</p>\n<p>The quintet were joined by Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Stan Van Tricht (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Kamiel Bonneu (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Eduardo Sep√∫lveda), Hannes Wilksch (Tudor), Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), and Sakarias Koller L√∏land (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Behind them, Vegard Stake Laengen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Gil Gelders (Soudal-QuickStep) took control of the peloton on behalf of race favourites Tadej Pogaƒçar and Remco Evenepoel, leaving the break to race five-and-a-half minutes up the road.</p>\n<p>Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), a rider who may have had high hopes for a top position after finishing fourth last year, didn‚Äôt make it as far as the Saint-Roch. The Belgian sadly abandoned an hour into the race, still feeling the after-effects of a crash at Amstel Gold Race.</p>\n<p>There were few other events of note during the run down towards Bastogne as the break pushed on over the C√¥te de Saint-Roch (1km at 11.2%) and towards the Col de Haussire (3.9km at 6.8%) with a five-minute lead.</p>\n<p>Heading back to Li√®ge<br />\nAt the halfway mark, just after the Haussire, the break remained fully intact at 5:30 up on the peloton, while back in the main group the Ineos Grenadiers pairing of Tobias Foss and 2018 winner Bob Jungels mounted a two-man counter-attack.</p>\n<p>The duo quickly built a minute‚Äôs advantage over the peloton, which provoked an upping of the pace from behind to bring the gap to the original break under three minutes.</p>\n<p>Coming at 93km to go, the next climb of the C√¥te de Mont-le-Soie (1.9km at 7.7%) would begin the series of climbs making up the race finale, with the next 20km bringing the trio of the C√¥te de Wanne (3.6km at 5.1%), C√¥te de Stockeu (1.1km at 11.9%), and the C√¥te de Haute-Lev√©e (2.2km at 7.7%).</p>\n<p>Florian Vermeersch and Pavel Sivakov took over the pacemaking for UAE on the Mont-le-Soie, bringing the gap to the leaders under two minutes as the two Ineos men battled on at just 30 seconds up the road.</p>\n<p>Domen Novak joined the fray on the Wanne, helping close to within sight of Jungels and Foss. The catch was duly made with 82km to run, between the Wanne and Stockeu.</p>\n<p>Boulahoite led the race past the Eddy Merckx monument midway up the steep slopes of the Stockeu, the Frenchman bringing Haig, Le Berre, Sep√∫lveda, and L√∏land with him as the breakaway broke apart.</p>\n<p>A minute later, Novak, Sivakov, and Brandon McNulty pulled the peloton up, though no big moves were forthcoming with five climbs and 78km still to run. Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) tried a brief move on the Haute-Lev√©e, though UAE swiftly regained control as the gap to the leaders ebbed under 40 seconds.</p>\n<p>The break survived much of the Col du Rosier (4.5km at 5.9%), but didn‚Äôt make it to the top before getting caught, meaning the peloton was all together heading into the final 60km. UAE, with Novak at the helm, continued to lead through the town of Spa and up the C√¥te de Desni√© (1.7km at 7.8%).</p>\n<p><strong>La Redoute and the finale</strong></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, it was the famous climb of the C√¥te de La Redoute (1.6km at 9.5%) which brought the big move of the day. There, midway up the hill and with 35km to go, Pogaƒçar floated to the front and rode off the front with ease and without getting out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>Behind him, fellow double Li√®ge winner Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) was nowhere to be seen. Instead, Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) led the charge to the top, with Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) coming across to make a four-man chase group.</p>\n<p>A 10-second deficit at the top of La Redoute grew to over 30 in the following kilometres, while Evenepoel led the next group on the road, a minute down.</p>\n<p>On the penultimate climb of the C√¥te des Forges (1.3km at 7.7%) with 34km to go, Pogaƒçar had a minute in hand over the chasing quartet. 15 seconds further back, attacks flew ‚Äì including from Evenepoel and Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), though there was little cohesion in group three.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar hit the final climb of the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons (1.4km at 11.4%) with victory in the bag, 1:20 up on the lead chase group. The larger group were closing in on Alaphilippe, Pidcock, Healy, and Ciccone, however, moving to within 10 seconds of the quartet.</p>\n<p>Healy and Ciccone went clear on the way up as Alaphilippe and Pidcock dropped back into the larger chase group. Evenepoel, meanwhile, dropped off the rear of the group and looked to stop at the roadside partway up the climb.</p>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of Jayco-AlUla ‚Äì riding for Michael Matthews ‚Äì and Israel-Premier Tech in the chase 25 seconds behind Healy and Ciccone, the pair would stay away into Li√®ge to contest the final podium places among themselves.</p>\n<p>There were no cat-and-mouse games on the final run to the line, with Ciccone and Healy determined ‚Äì and successful ‚Äì in their mission to stay away to capture second and third.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=11&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=11&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First run in 1892, it is the oldest of the five Monuments of the European professional road cycling calendar; usually coming as the last of the spring classics. It is held annually in late April, in the Ardennes region of Belgium, from Li√®ge to Bastogne and back. It is considered one of the most arduous one-day cycling events in the world because of its length and demanding course.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) soared to his third career Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge victory with another peerless spring performance, going clear on the C√¥te de La Redoute and soloing the final 35km to take a ninth Monument win.</p>\n<p>The world champion kicked off the attacking on the famous hill, moving to the front midway up the 1.6km slope and pushing on to build a 10-second lead at the top.<br />\nAs chasing groups formed, attacked, and countered behind him, Pogaƒçar pushed on alone to build his lead to over a minute. By the final climb of the C√¥te de Roche-aux-Faucons, it was enough time in hand for victory to be certain, and he could race into Li√®ge without worries and with plenty of time to celebrate his win.</p>\n<p>Further back, a chase group made up of Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor), Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) had formed on La Redoute, while the other pre-race favourite Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) showed that he has yet to hit top form after his long injury layoff.</p>\n<p>Healy and Ciccone emerged as the strongest riders in the chase on the Roche-aux-Faucons, going clear on the 11% slopes and extending their advantage on the descent towards Li√®ge.</p>\n<p>The pair carried a 25-second lead into the final kilometres of the race, setting up a two-man battle to the finish for the two podium spots behind Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Over one minute after the world champion rolled across the line to round off six hours of racing with his 95th career victory, Healy led Ciccone into the final 500 metres, with the Italian coming around before the line to nab second place.</p>\n<p>Simone Velasco (XDS-Astana) led the larger third chase group home for fourth at 1:10 down, while Thibau Nys completed a good day for Lidl-Trek to take fifth place as the top home finisher.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt feels great to finish the first part of the season like this. I‚Äôm just happy that the whole season so far went perfect,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt the plan [to attack on La Redoute], but it was such a hard pace before that, I saw a number of teams didn‚Äôt have a lot of teammates anymore. I said, ‚ÄòOK, I‚Äôll test my legs a little bit and see if I can get a gap on the top‚Äô, and then I‚Äôll decide if I continue or not.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen I just committed because I had good legs ‚Äì also on the second climb after La Redoute. I could go to the finish, so I‚Äôm super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe oldest Monument in cycling ran its 111th edition on Sunday, with the day featuring a 252km route spearing south from Li√®ge towards Bastogne and then back up to Li√®ge again.</p>\n<p>4,300 metres of climbing lay ahead of the riders at the start as 11 major climbs filled the route, including the C√¥te de Saint-Roch, C√¥te de Stockeu, C√¥te de Haute-Lev√©e, C√¥te de La Redoute, and the final test of the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons.</p>\n<p>The battle for the day‚Äôs breakaway began almost as soon as the flag dropped to start the race, with a 46kph average speed over the first half hour signalling the riders‚Äô intent. The break of the day was set within the first 30km as 12 men made it up the road well before the race‚Äôs first climb.</p>\n<p>Wagner Bazin WB placed three men in the move in the shape of Ceriel Desal, Johan Meens and Henri-Fran√ßois Renard-Haquin, while TotalEnergies had Rayan Boulahoite and Valentin Retailleau out front.</p>\n<p>The quintet were joined by Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Stan Van Tricht (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Kamiel Bonneu (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Eduardo Sep√∫lveda), Hannes Wilksch (Tudor), Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), and Sakarias Koller L√∏land (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Behind them, Vegard Stake Laengen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Gil Gelders (Soudal-QuickStep) took control of the peloton on behalf of race favourites Tadej Pogaƒçar and Remco Evenepoel, leaving the break to race five-and-a-half minutes up the road.</p>\n<p>Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), a rider who may have had high hopes for a top position after finishing fourth last year, didn‚Äôt make it as far as the Saint-Roch. The Belgian sadly abandoned an hour into the race, still feeling the after-effects of a crash at Amstel Gold Race.</p>\n<p>There were few other events of note during the run down towards Bastogne as the break pushed on over the C√¥te de Saint-Roch (1km at 11.2%) and towards the Col de Haussire (3.9km at 6.8%) with a five-minute lead.</p>\n<p>Heading back to Li√®ge<br />\nAt the halfway mark, just after the Haussire, the break remained fully intact at 5:30 up on the peloton, while back in the main group the Ineos Grenadiers pairing of Tobias Foss and 2018 winner Bob Jungels mounted a two-man counter-attack.</p>\n<p>The duo quickly built a minute‚Äôs advantage over the peloton, which provoked an upping of the pace from behind to bring the gap to the original break under three minutes.</p>\n<p>Coming at 93km to go, the next climb of the C√¥te de Mont-le-Soie (1.9km at 7.7%) would begin the series of climbs making up the race finale, with the next 20km bringing the trio of the C√¥te de Wanne (3.6km at 5.1%), C√¥te de Stockeu (1.1km at 11.9%), and the C√¥te de Haute-Lev√©e (2.2km at 7.7%).</p>\n<p>Florian Vermeersch and Pavel Sivakov took over the pacemaking for UAE on the Mont-le-Soie, bringing the gap to the leaders under two minutes as the two Ineos men battled on at just 30 seconds up the road.</p>\n<p>Domen Novak joined the fray on the Wanne, helping close to within sight of Jungels and Foss.

A few seconds later, Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) held off a surging Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) to take third place.</p>\n<p>With 55km to go, C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) had jumped across to escapee Anne Knijnenburg (VolkerWessels) on the C√¥te d&#8217;Ereffe before dropping Knijnenburg on the C√¥te de Cherave to go solo.</p>\n<p>On the final lap, Kerbaol was almost a minute ahead of the peloton until FDJ-Suez took up the chase, and Kerbaol was caught on the C√¥te de Cherave with just under 7km to go.</p>\n<p>Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto kept the pace high to discourage attacks, and a peloton of about 25 riders entered the Mur de Huy together.

The peloton was about 20 seconds behind, and Kerbaol managed to keep a steady gap up the Mur de Huy, passing the finish line with 37.2km to go 18 seconds ahead of the pack.</p>\n<p>On the plateau afterwards, Kerbaol could gain time again, increasing her advantage to 57 seconds 32km from the finish. However, FDJ-Suez in particular started to chase hard and used the C√¥te d‚ÄôEreffe to make up time: Kerbaol crested the climb only 13 seconds ahead.</p>\n<p>She did not give up, though, pulling out a 25-second gap again before the lead-outs into the C√¥te de Cherave saw her advantage melt away, and Kerbaol was caught early on the penultimate climb. Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) set a hard pace to discourage attacks until her teammate Antonia Niedermaier took over on the last metres of the climb, and at the top, the peloton was down to about 25 riders.</p>\n<p>After a high-speed descent into Huy, Labous led the group under the flamme rouge with Vollering on her wheel. The French champion dropped off Vollering with 350 metres to go, but Vollering couldn‚Äôt respond to Pieterse‚Äôs attack and had to contend with second place while Pieterse celebrated the biggest road victory of her career so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9051&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9051&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

At the same time, defending champion Stevie Williams (Israel-Premier Tech) confirmed that he was not feeling his best. He struggled and was distanced from the peloton.</p>\n<p>The break was left with three in front of the charging peloton as racing entered its final 41km.</p>\n<p>Desal slid out of a corner, issuing an ominous warning for what was to come.

It traditionally marks the turning point of the spring classics, with the climbers and stage racers replacing the cobbled classics riders as the favourites.</p>\n<p>In the biggest win of his career and one of the races of the season, Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) played the perfect hand to defeat both Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) at a thrilling Amstel Gold Race, outsprinting both the Olympic and world champion to the line on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel led out and opened up the sprint just outside Valkenberg, with Pogaƒçar poised in his wheel. The rainbow jersey came around him as Evenepoel was forced to sit down and accept defeat; however, the Dane emerged from Pogaƒçar&#8217;s slipstream to shock everyone.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked set to ride into the distance from the peloton when he launched away solo from Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) and the whole field on the Kruisberg, after the pair had scorched away from the group of favourites one climb earlier up the Gulperberg with 47km to go.</p>\n<p>However, the world champion showed signs that he is, in fact, human, with his gap barely extending further than 30 seconds as it tends to do when he goes alone. Behind, Evenepoel led the chase, exploding into life away from an uncooperative group with 25 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>The Olympic champion caught Skjelmose, who had also gone solo to try and chase Pogaƒçar. Evenepoel did the lion&#8217;s share of the work in the final run for home, and incredibly, with 8km to ride, the 30-second lead had disappeared, and the catch was made.</p>\n<p>However, with Skjelmose able to keep his powder dry as Evenepoel did most of the chasing, the Dane managed to save just enough for the exhilarating three-up sprint final, producing a true David and Goliath performance in the face of two of modern cycling&#8217;s great champions.</p>\n<p>Asked if he could believe what he&#8217;d done, Skjelmose said, &#8220;No, I really don&#8217;t. I was telling Remco all the time that I was fucked and &#8216;Please, pull on the climbs, I&#8217;m on the limit&#8217;, and when we stopped, I only took pulls because I was riding for the podium,&#8221; said Skjelmose in his winner&#8217;s interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Already, that would have been a really big result for me. I tried to keep the group going so they didn&#8217;t come back from behind. Of course, I sprinted for the best result, but I thought I was going to cramp and see them go into the horizon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skjelmose couldn&#8217;t quite remember what happened in the final charge for the line, clearly in shock at what he&#8217;d just achieved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Remco did it perfect, I tried to have a big of a gap and go on the right, but Remco went right and fuck, Tadej went on the right as well, so I went on the left and I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe it, I really didn&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said Skjelmose, describing the moment he came around Pogaƒçar. Then, the emotion came pouring out, and he dedicated the special win to his late grandfather.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means so much to me, I had so much bad luck already this season, I lost my grandad a bit more than a month ago, and I really wanted to give him a win, so this is for him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAction kicked off for the 59th Amstel Gold Race once again in Maastricht, with the Limburg hills in the Netherlands, 34 climbs and 255km of brutally undulating action set to decide the day&#8217;s winner. With the return of Evenepoel and the anticipation of a first battle in 2025 with Pogaƒçar, the tension was building.</p>\n<p>The break of the day started to form when five men got away from the main peloton in the opening 40km. Five soon turned to eight, and the group, including Michel Hessmann (Movistar), R√©mi Cavagna (Groupama-FDJ), Robert Stannard (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious),</p>\n<p>Emiel Verstrynge (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Cedric Beullens, Jarrad Drizners (Lotto), Hartthijs de Vries and Jelle Johannink (Unibet Tietema Rockets) quickly built an advantage of four minutes.</p>\n<p>With the favourites of the day, Pogaƒçar, Evenepoel and Tom Pidcock among their respective ranks, UAE Team Emirates-XRG, Soudal-QuickStep and Q36.5 began swapping turns on the front of the main bunch to keep the gap under control with the hills coming thick and fast.</p>\n<p>As the nerves built up for the main climbs and final 100km of racing, the gap to the break fell below the one-minute mark, but there was also a crash for some of the favourites, with Evenepoel, Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) reportedly coming down. They were all quickly back on their bikes and back in the peloton.</p>\n<p>Dylan van Baarle (Visma-Lease a Bike), Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), Reuben Thompson (Lotto) and Simon Clarke (Israel-Premier Tech) then mounted a counter-attack out of the peloton, quickly eeking out a 35-second lead with 97km to go.</p>\n<p>The break started imploding on the first time up the Cauberg, with only the four strongest escapees: Hessmann, Cavagna, Beullens, and Johannink remaining in front of the now UAE-led peloton.</p>\n<p>They held a narrow 15-second lead at the first passage of the finish, until they were swept up one by one, and Hessmann was the last to be caught with 69km to go.</p>\n<p>Despite Tim Wellens abandoning and Jhonatan Narv√°ez ending his race early due to a crash, UAE were still keeping things tight for Pogaƒçar with numbers, marking every small move made. Pavel Sivakov soon settled into position on the front, with three other domestiques in front of the world champion.</p>\n<p>EF Education-EasyPost took over on the front as the peloton hit the Loorberg, with Ben Healy looking primed for an attack. With Pogaƒçar lurking closely behind, however, no big charge came from the Irishman.</p>\n<p>When Pogaƒçar&#8217;s last man, Brandon McNulty, pulled off the front on the Gulperberg, the race exploded into life after a rapid but cagey opening four and a half hours.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t the current world champion who made the difference, however, with former two-time rainbow jersey winner Alaphilippe kicking things off with a stinging attack. Pogaƒçar followed, of course, but it didn&#8217;t look as easy as it normally does for the Slovenian with 47.5km to go.</p>\n<p>The pair went away from everyone else, but only with a narrow 13-second lead heading onto the Kruisberg. This was where Pogaƒçar returned to his dominant self and attacked away with stunning seated power to go solo with more than 40km still to ride.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek were looking strong behind, reeling in Alaphilippe with two in the chase group. Evenepoel, Van Aert, Healy and Pidcock were also present in the main group behind, still within 13 seconds of Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t disappear into the distance, but as racing hit the Eyserbosweg for the first and only time, the gap to the lone leader grew out to 30 seconds. Evenepoel had a teammate, Ilan Van Wilder, to chase for him, who kept the gap below the half-minute mark.</p>\n<p>Once the chasers hit the steepest road in the Netherlands, the Keutenberg, Evenepoel accelerated on the front and made an impression on Pogaƒçar&#8217;s lead. But the chase wasn&#8217;t a united effort, and the Olympic champion was countered by Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Skjelmose sat 25 seconds behind while the main group of 13 struggled to cooperate in their chase, a further nine seconds back. Evenepoel reignited the chase group with a solo attack that failed 26km from the finish.</p>\n<p>He kept trying to break away, however, getting some breathing room just ahead of the second ascent up the Cauberg. Soon, the Olympic champion joined Skjelmose, who maintained a 30-second gap to Pogaƒçar to make it a two-up chase.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel was making an impression now, hitting the foot of the Cauberg with only 21 seconds left to make up. Pogaƒçar certainly wasn&#8217;t in top form, and looked as though he might become unstuck at the hands of the Belgian.</p>\n<p>The chasing group, too, wasn&#8217;t out of it yet, with Healy, Van Aert and Pidcock all still in the game for victory and now just a few seconds behind Evenepoel and Skjelmose.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar crossed the finish line and took the bell just 13 seconds ahead of the chasing duo, with the big group only a further 18 seconds down. Just 20km and three more climbs separated him from the victory, but he was, for once, looking very vulnerable.</p>\n<p>The bigger group of chasers were failing to cooperate once again and had left it up to only Evenepoel and Skjelmose to try and deny Pogaƒçar the first part of the Ardennes triple.</p>\n<p>12km further down the road, and the unthinkable had happened, Evenepoel and Skjelmose had pulled back the world champion, proving that he isn&#8217;t invincible. With Pogaƒçar clearly not at his best, Evenepoel gave him no time to rest, upping the pace on the flat to ensure he still had to work for it.</p>\n<p>Only one climb remained, and the organisers looked set to get just what they wanted by returning the Cauberg to its previous position 2.4km from the finish, however, it was cagey, with Pogaƒçar gambling on a sprint and Skjelmose actually working on the front to ensure the quickly closing bunch had no chance of infiltrating the podium.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel led the trio around the final corner and onto the iconic finishing straight in Berg en Terblijt, which has witnessed some famous finishes over the years. The Belgian sprinted from the front as he did in his return race at Brabantse Pijl, but Pogaƒçar had the power to come around him, only for Skjelmose to find an extra gear and outkick the world champion by a tyre&#8217;s width.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It traditionally marks the turning point of the spring classics, with the climbers and stage racers replacing the cobbled classics riders as the favourites.</p>\n<p>In the biggest win of his career and one of the races of the season, Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) played the perfect hand to defeat both Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) at a thrilling Amstel Gold Race, outsprinting both the Olympic and world champion to the line on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel led out and opened up the sprint just outside Valkenberg, with Pogaƒçar poised in his wheel. The rainbow jersey came around him as Evenepoel was forced to sit down and accept defeat; however, the Dane emerged from Pogaƒçar&#8217;s slipstream to shock everyone.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked set to ride into the distance from the peloton when he launched away solo from Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) and the whole field on the Kruisberg, after the pair had scorched away from the group of favourites one climb earlier up the Gulperberg with 47km to go.</p>\n<p>However, the world champion showed signs that he is, in fact, human, with his gap barely extending further than 30 seconds as it tends to do when he goes alone. Behind, Evenepoel led the chase, exploding into life away from an uncooperative group with 25 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>The Olympic champion caught Skjelmose, who had also gone solo to try and chase Pogaƒçar. Evenepoel did the lion&#8217;s share of the work in the final run for home, and incredibly, with 8km to ride, the 30-second lead had disappeared, and the catch was made.</p>\n<p>However, with Skjelmose able to keep his powder dry as Evenepoel did most of the chasing, the Dane managed to save just enough for the exhilarating three-up sprint final, producing a true David and Goliath performance in the face of two of modern cycling&#8217;s great champions.</p>\n<p>Asked if he could believe what he&#8217;d done, Skjelmose said, &#8220;No, I really don&#8217;t. I was telling Remco all the time that I was fucked and &#8216;Please, pull on the climbs, I&#8217;m on the limit&#8217;, and when we stopped, I only took pulls because I was riding for the podium,&#8221; said Skjelmose in his winner&#8217;s interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Already, that would have been a really big result for me. I tried to keep the group going so they didn&#8217;t come back from behind. Of course, I sprinted for the best result, but I thought I was going to cramp and see them go into the horizon.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Skjelmose couldn&#8217;t quite remember what happened in the final charge for the line, clearly in shock at what he&#8217;d just achieved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think Remco did it perfect, I tried to have a big of a gap and go on the right, but Remco went right and fuck, Tadej went on the right as well, so I went on the left and I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe it, I really didn&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; said Skjelmose, describing the moment he came around Pogaƒçar. Then, the emotion came pouring out, and he dedicated the special win to his late grandfather.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It means so much to me, I had so much bad luck already this season, I lost my grandad a bit more than a month ago, and I really wanted to give him a win, so this is for him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAction kicked off for the 59th Amstel Gold Race once again in Maastricht, with the Limburg hills in the Netherlands, 34 climbs and 255km of brutally undulating action set to decide the day&#8217;s winner.

Held in mid-April on the same day as the men&#8217;s event, the race starts in Maastricht and finishes in Berg en Terblijt, Valkenburg. It features 21 categorized climbs, including four ascents of the Cauberg. The race is run entirely within the boundaries of Dutch Limburg, starting in the city of Maastricht and finishing in Berg en Terblijt, 1.8 kilometres from the top of the Cauberg.</p>\n<p>Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) won the Amstel Gold Race Women, soloing to the finish just seven seconds ahead of a group of four, where Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) came around Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) in the final metres to take the runner-up spot.</p>\n<p>They had all been part of a 23-rider breakaway that formed at the start of the antepenultimate lap, following the second ascent of the Cauberg. </p>\n<p>On the final lap, Pieterse forced a selection on the Geulhemmerberg that eventually led to a front group of five, also including Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) and Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Van Dijk attacked inside 6km to go, Bredewold jumped across, and the other three couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t close the gap. </p>\n<p>After a high-speed descent into Valkenburg, Bredewold left Van Dijk behind on the Cauberg and held off the chasers both on the climb and the 2km run-in to the finish to take the biggest victory of her career so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a rough week mentally, the team really pulled me through. Topsport is not easy. You put so much time and effort and emotion into it, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt fall in the right place. It almost doesn‚Äôt feel fair, and it doesn‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs hard to win a race. You need a team, and that‚Äôs what helped me win today,&#8221; said an emotional Bredewold after the race, before recounting how the race played out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is how we race as a team. We can always attack, seize the opportunity, and this was perfect. In this breakaway, I was struggling so much. And then we did this little descent, I love that descent, we had a gap, and Puck and Juliette went. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For some reason, I could not follow them, but I could stay really close, and Ellen [van Dijk] was the perfect companion. I said to her &#8216;come on, we need to do it together, for sure they cannot pace harder than we can if we do it together.&#8217; I‚Äôm also happy she committed fully.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After chasing onto three lead trio, Van Dijk was instrumental to Bredewold‚Äôs victory in another way, spurring the 24-year-old into action with her attack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm glad she did [attack]. I was maybe too scared to attack. I thought I would gamble on my sprint, maybe I can follow them this time. Ellen went and I thought they would jump, [but] they didn‚Äôt. And then I thought &#8216;it‚Äôs up to me.&#8217; Danny [Stam], behind me in the car, was saying &#8216;now it‚Äôs all or nothing, just full gas together.&#8217; I hated this Cauberg, but I thought I just keep going and don‚Äôt look at the powermeter, just go,&#8221; Bredewold said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This victory means so much. This is Amstel, it‚Äôs such a big race, and it‚Äôs in Holland. It‚Äôs just a fucking dream, honestly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nAn early breakaway of nine riders was reeled in before the first passage of the finish line with 73.4km to go of the 157.3km race, and Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) had to chase back after a crash.</p>\n<p>On the lap of the finishing circuit that followed, Anna van der Breggen led the SD Worx-Protime team in splitting the peloton with a blistering pace.</p>\n<p>Attacks on the Cauberg and the plateau afterwards led to a front group of 23 riders that consisted of Marion Bunel, Femke de Vries (both Visma-Lease a Bike), Blanka Vas, Bredewold, Lorena Wiebes (all SD Worx-Protime), Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility), Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Labous, Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez), Pieterse, Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), Anna Henderson, Van Dijk (both Lidl-Trek), Quinty Ton (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Mareille Meijering, Paula Pati√±o (Movistar), Mara Roldan, Megan Jastrab (Picnic-PostNL), Brodie Chapman, Persico (UAE Team ADQ), Eline Jansen (VolkerWessels), and Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly).</p>\n<p>As the break pulled away, Jade Wiel (FDJ-Suez), Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), and Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) formed a chase trio in an attempt to bridge to the front, but they were absorbed by the peloton with 30km to go. Van der Breggen, meanwhile, had abandoned the race after her earlier work.</p>\n<p>By that point, the front group was 1:30 ahead, and when they climbed the Cauberg near the end of the penultimate lap, the attacks began. Labous was the first to make a move, then Pieterse countered, but things came back together on the plateau. </p>\n<p>Further behind, Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) increased the pace as well, but as the peloton was 1:38 minutes behind entering the final lap, the victory was out of reach for most of the pre-race favourites.</p>\n<p>Pieterse and Labous attacked again on the Geulhemmerberg to split the group for good. Persico, Van Dijk, and Bredewold managed to limit the gap, and Persico left the other two behind on the upper part of the climb to start a solo chase, bridging the gap with 16.8km to go. </p>\n<p>Van Dijk and Bredewold returned with 12.3km to go and with only the relatively easy Bemelerberg and the final ascent of the Cauberg to come. </p>\n<p>After Bredewold responded to Van Dijk‚Äôs attack 5.6km from the finish, the two riders worked together until early on the Cauberg, where Bredewold left Van Dijk behind. </p>\n<p>In the group behind, Labous dropped Pieterse and Persico, picking up Van Dijk close to the top of the climb. Pieterse came back just after the climb and immediately accelerated past the other two, but could not get a gap. </p>\n<p>Labous and Pieterse led the chase with Van Dijk sitting on, but Bredewold was still four seconds ahead going into the final kilometre and held on to win. </p>\n<p>Persico returned with 500 metres to go but had nothing left for the sprint that was opened by Pieterse. On the final metres, though, Van Dijk came from behind with speed to finish second.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9050&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9050&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race was organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour from 2005 to 2009, a 1.HC event from 2010 to 2019, and since 2020 has been part of the UCI ProSeries.</p>\n<p>Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) beat compatriot Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) to win De Brabantse Pijl in his first race after a winter spent recovering from injury. Ant√≥nio Morgado (UAE Team Emirates) led the peloton to the line for third place 27 seconds behind the duo.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Van Aert attacked on the Hertstraat, the first of three climbs on the 19.8km circuits with 55km to go, and used the Moskesstraat and Holstheide to build on their lead. They had Joe Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech) along for company until the final lap, when they left the promising young Briton behind.</p>\n<p>Van Aert appeared to be in a prime position to out-sprint Evenepoel, but the Soudal-QuickStep rider sprinted from the front and held off his rival to get a huge morale boost after a difficult period of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible,&#8221; Evenepoel said. &#8220;I knew in the last days that I was pretty good, but to race from so far away together with Wout, who is in, let&#8217;s say, growing shape &#8211; and being back here on a course that is not 100% mine &#8211; it feels pretty good. Then to beat Wout in the sprint, taking the lead in the last two kilometers&#8230; </p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought I was beaten already before we started the sprint, but you always have to sprint. It&#8217;s been a hard race, and I know my sprint stays the same whether it&#8217;s an easy race or a hard race, and over the years, I became a bit more explosive. So that&#8217;s why I trusted my sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to thank my dad for the last two hard trainings behind the scooter. He really pushed me to the limit sometimes and it paid off &#8211; it&#8217;s so incredible to open the season with a win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van Aert was in search of his first victory of the season, but fell short one position for a third time this spring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, I hoped to win, especially in this situation, going to the line in a sprint. But I held nothing back. Remco slightly killed me in this final hour of the race. It was already hard to hang on in the last lap, so he really deserves to win,&#8221; Van Aert said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not too disappointed, because he was just so much stronger. I hoped to beat him, but a sprint after a race like this is not the same and apparently I didn&#8217;t have a good sprint anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 2025 Brabantse Pijl kicked off under clear skies from Beersel and as soon as the official start was given, Tuur Dens (Flanders Baloise) launched an attack and was joined by five riders: Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB), Joren Bloem (RKT), √Ödne Holter (Uno-X Mobility), I√∫ri LeitƒÅo (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Antonio Jes√∫s Soto (Kern Pharma) in the day&#8217;s move.</p>\n<p>The leaders could not gain more than two minutes, and after 100 kilometres of racing, they entered the finishing circuits with just under a minute&#8217;s lead as attacks came from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck led a 10-man counter-attack but they were caught before the first ascent of the S-Bocht in Overijse. The surge brought the six-man escape group&#8217;s lead down to 41 seconds with three laps to go.</p>\n<p>EF Education-EasyPost came to the front in force along with Visma-Lease a Bike and Q36.5 Pro Cycling, ramping up the pace before the Hertstraat climb but it was the killer bees who surged to the front to launch Van Aert on the cobbled ascent, followed quickly by Evenepoel in his first major effort of the season.</p>\n<p>Their surge caused a split in the peloton with only 20 riders able to match the pace and brought Dens, who had been dropped, back into the fold while Leit√£o drove the pace to try to keep the breakaway alive.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Van Aert hit the front at the base of the Moskesstraat climb and breezed past the rest of the breakaway before forming their own along with Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility), Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates) and Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>The race rapidly hit the Holsteide climb where Evenepoel kept a vicious pace and only Van Aert could hold on. Joe Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech) scrambled across, leaving three in the lead chased by ten: Holter and Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility), Tibor del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost), Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Narv√°ez, Soto, Guillermo Silva (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Tom Pidcock (Q36.5)</p>\n<p>Van Aert, Evenepoel and Blackmore made their way up the S-Bocht to see two laps to go and 48 seconds on the ever-growing chase group, and built on that advantage despite a series of accelerations from the bunch over the flatter section of the course.</p>\n<p>The gap began to go the other direction as the race hit the triple Hertstraat/Moskesstraat/Holstheide climbs, going as low as 39 seconds before the trio got back to their team time trial effort. With 25km to go, they had 54 seconds and were cooperating nicely, but were up against a large and motivated chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>With Alpecin-Deceuninck, EF Education-EasyPost and Cofidis taking turns, the leaders had just 33 seconds on the S-Bocht Overijse summit at the bell.</p>\n<p>Once the leaders hit the Hertstraat, Evenepoel put in a dig, kicking Blackmore out the back but not dislodging Van Aert. The two Belgian superstars got to work holding off the chasers, with Blackmore going back to the peloton. </p>\n<p>On the Moskestraat, Evenepoel tried to get rid of Van Aert but failed. Baudin attacked from the field and chased solo ahead of Leknessund, only a few seconds ahead of the bunch.</p>\n<p>There were no further attacks between Van Aert and Evenepoel on the Holstheide as the duo knew they needed to save their efforts to avoid being caught over the final 7.7km. When they saw a minute&#8217;s gap with 2km remaining, the two Belgians looked at each other before Evenepoel got back to pulling them to the final climb.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel kept a close eye on Van Aert as they started up the S-Bocht, the fans going wild to see their two heroes battling it out. </p>\n<p>With 1km to go, Evenepoel was still on the front, looking back as if he was leading a match sprint.

It takes place mainly on the territory of Grand Besan√ßon M√©tropole. Classified in category 1.1 of the UCI Europe Tour, the Classic Grand Besan√ßon Doubs is therefore open to WorldTeams within the limit of 50% of the participating teams, professional continental teams, continental teams and national teams[6].</p>\n<p>Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ) attacked from a reduced peloton on the steepest section of the climb to Monfaucon and won Classic Grand Besan√ßon Doubs. </p>\n<p>On the double-digit gradients of the C√¥te de la Malate, the second ascent marking the path to the finish, Martin made his move when pacemaker Matteo Vercher (TotalEnergies) dropped back with 2.5km to go. Martin was next in line and accelerated over the next 500 metres, charging ahead for his solo effort as the gradient relented slightly.</p>\n<p>Cl√©ment Berthet (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Jos√© Manuel D√≠az (Burgos Berpellet BH) went on the chase for the final 2km to the finish, but never made the catch, D√≠az taking second, six seconds back, and Berthet third, another two seconds back. </p>\n<p>Martin celebrated with a fist in the air, taking his first victory in almost three years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I had the confidence all day.

It is one of cycling&#8217;s oldest races, and is one of the &#8216;Monuments&#8217; or classics of the European calendar, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking. From its beginning in 1896 until 1967, the race started in Paris and ended in Roubaix; in 1966 the start moved to Chantilly; and since 1977 it has started in Compi√®gne, about 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-east of the centre of Paris. Since 1943, the finish has for the most part taken place in the Roubaix Velodrome. The race is currently organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation, and takes place in early April, usually on the second Sunday. It has been called the Hell of the North, a Sunday in Hell (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), the Queen of the Classics or la Pascale: the Easter race. Since 1977, the winner of Paris‚ÄìRoubaix has received a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) has soared to his third straight victory in Paris-Roubaix after a crash and high-tension pursuit by Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) ended with a solo triumph for the Dutchman.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and Van der Poel were leading the race with some 40 kilometres to go when the Slovenian fell hard on a right hand bend on sector 9, suffering injuries in his left wrist and being delayed when he needed a replacement bike, with a subsequent front wheel puncture then compounding his woes.</p>\n<p>Despite having a bidon flung at his face and a late puncture of his own on the Carrefour d&#8217;Arbre forcing him to change bikes, too &#8211; with his first being run over the team car just metres behind &#8211;  Van der Poel kept his cool and rode a near-faultless finale. In the process he became the eighth rider in Roubaix history to win the Hell of the North three times, and the first since Francesco Moser in 1980 to take three editions in a row.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar faded slowly but surely, and crossed the line around 1:20 behind Van der Poel, with Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) taking third by outsprinting Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Florian Vermeersch (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a hard race and I was really suffering, too bad Tadej made this mistake on a corner,&#8221; Van der Poel said afterwards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But then I just had to go for it and it was still quite far from the finish, it was really hard especially with the last two sectors with the headwind. I was really struggling but I&#8217;m happy to make it to the finish line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for when Pogaƒçar crashed, he said, &#8220;the speed was superhigh and I think he misjudged the turn a bit. I was just quick enough to save it, and then I don&#8217;t know what happened afterwards, because I had quite a big gap but I had to go for it. That&#8217;s part of racing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Poel suffered a puncture &#8220;and I didn&#8217;t know the time gap, because my radio didn&#8217;t work, so I couldn&#8217;t ask for it or say I had a flat tyre. It took a while til the car was there but it all worked out in the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was no sense of revenge after losing Flanders to Pogaƒçar he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just happy that I could find my good legs again. But we all know what an incredible champion Tadej is, what he did here in his first Roubaix- it doesn&#8217;t surprise me but it&#8217;s also not normal, he&#8217;s just an exceptional talent.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Probably it would have been the two of us going to the velodrome if he doesn&#8217;t make that mistake so I guess we&#8217;ll see him back here next year to take his revenge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A searing attack by Pogaƒçar at 72km to go on the Tilloy sector brought across Van der Poel and his Alpecin teammate Jasper Philipsen, reducing the race leaders to just three. Pedersen was unlucky enough to suffer a puncture just as the Slovenian made his move, while another top favourite, Van Aert had crashed early on, only bouncing back in the final battle for third.</p>\n<p>45 kilometres from the finish, a duel of effort between Van der Poel and Pogaƒçar began, and the two top pre-race favourites forged on. However, Pogaƒçar then was unlucky enough to crash, leaving Van der Poel ahead and alone at the head of the field. </p>\n<p>Van der Poel had his own issues, with a bottle thrown at the Dutchman&#8217;s face with 33 kilometres to go and a puncture on the Carrefour d&#8217;Arbre. Nothing, though, could stop Van der Poel from heading home into the velodrome to clinch the eighth Monument of his career, and after Milan-San Remo earlier this spring, the second of this season.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing the heavy overnight rain, racing got underway in dry, overcast conditions, with Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) launching the first of a flurry of early attacks. Ten riders then attempted to move ahead, including former Milan-San Remo podium finisher Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) and Rasmus Pedersen (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale). But UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike were seemingly determined either to put a rider in the break or ensure not dangerous riders went in it, and each time the early bids were sucked back. </p>\n<p>Finally a group of eight that met with general approval from Roubaix&#8217;s unofficial powers-that-be went up the road after almost 30 kilometres of skirmishing, with Pogaƒçar personally chasing down a counter-move that tried to bridge across. Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers), Oier Lazkano (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Markus Hoelgaard (Uno-X), Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost), Jasper De Buyst (Lotto),Rory Townsend (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) and Abram Stockman (Unibet-Tietema Rockets) all got the UAE/Visma green light. It was certainly a strong break, but barring Lazkano, perhaps, a former winner of Spain&#8217;s closest equivalent to Roubaix, the cobbled Cl√°sica Ja√©n, their chances of long-term glory were slim.</p>\n<p>With average speeds of just over a jaw-dropping 51 kph in the first hour, the eight-man break of the day nonetheless managed to open up a gap of three minutes on the long, flat approach roads to the first of the 30 sectors of cobbles. Meantime Movistar were having a miserable start to the race, as Mathias Norsgaard had the dubious honour of being the first rider to abandon the 2025 edition Paris-Roubaix, then teammate Manilo Moro and Albert Torres both quickly following him after crashes, and even before they&#8217;d reached the cobbles.</p>\n<p>Things were going better for the break, which rattled onto the opening pav√© at Troisville, led &#8211; unsurprisingly &#8211;  by Lazkano, with a healthy three minutes&#8217; advantage. As the bunch hit top speed to tackle the initial sector, the first big crash of the race took place, too, when two-times Roubaix runner-up Philipsen and fellow Belgian Classics specialist Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek) both came down on a greasy left-hand corner.</p>\n<p>The first sector of Paris-Roubaix always causes an inordinate amount of damage and this year was no exception. Other top favourites like Van Aert and Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), the former due to a crash, the latter through a puncture, also found themselves in trouble and off the back. But both fought hard to regain contact, Van Aert quickly succeeding thanks to support from his teammates, Ganna and Philipsen much less so, but it was all a foretaste of what was to come.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek drove hard to maintain the pace in the pack, but when Alpecin-Deceuninck added their shoulder to the collective wheel alongside the German squad, they nonetheless took it fairly gently to allow Philipsen and Ganna&#8217;s large chase group back on board. Meanwhile, Pogaƒçar, always staying close to the front, showed he was ready for any development and staying out of trouble. </p>\n<p>A holding pattern seemed to emerge after Ganna and Philiipsen&#8217;s group regained contact, and the break still stubbornly held on to a two minute advantage as the race hit the 25th sector of cobbles, Verchain-Maugr√© to Qu√©r√©naing. Ineos Grenadiers, given Ganna&#8217;s return, then added more firepower to the peloton&#8217;s chase thanks to young British duo Sam Watson and Josh Tarling. Then even as the crunch sector of Arenberg approached, the peloton&#8217;s pace, which was never that low, once again began to rise remorselessly.</p>\n<p>Barring Ganna and Philipsen&#8217;s difficulties, which they had both resolved, and a big question mark hovering over Van Aert, the first half of 2025 Paris-Roubaix had thus developed fairly as much as expected. Ahead of Arenberg, UAE, Deceuninck-Alpecin, Lidl-Trek, Ineos and Visma were all still present in significant numbers in a very large main peloton, and little had unsettled their pre-race strategies of getting the top names ready for the main Roubaix battlegrounds well-placed and supported.</p>\n<p>Coming onto the four-star Haveluy, sector 20 and the &#8216;prologue&#8217; for Arenberg, though, that was all about to change. Pedersen&#8217;s first big acceleration of the race brought about a marked rise in speed, and when the response came from one of the top players in person. Pogaƒçar shot past Pedersen&#8217; right, Van der Poel then poured fuel on top of the Slovenian&#8217;s acceleration. By the time they came off the Haveluy, only 20 riders or so remained in the front group and the real Roubaix selection process had begun, even if of the favourites, Ganna was missing once again.</p>\n<p><strong>Arenberg forest</strong><br />\nThe leading early break still had 20 seconds on a rapidly reformed main peloton as they hit the forest. But when Pogaƒçar once again accelerated hard at the front, forcing a 15-strong group clear alongside Van der Poel, it was clear the early movers were doomed. </p>\n<p>Sure enough, the two big favourites weaved their way through the last remnants of the breakaway as they came off the much-feared Arenberg sector, fortunately without any incident despite the clear difference in speed. Then when Van der Poel briefly pressed home their advantage on the roads beyond, further shredding the small group of race leaders, it looked like a really important break had formed.</p>\n<p>By the time Van der Poel ceased powering away, only Philipsen, Stefan Bissegger (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Pedersen and Pogaƒçar were with him. Pogaƒçar signalled for his team car, receiving a timely gel, and as they reached sector 18 and another feed zone, the two Alpecin riders, first and second last year, ensured the gap on 14 chasers remained at nearly a minute away. </p>\n<p>Such was the power of the front group, containing all three top finishers from Paris-Roubaix 2024 plus Pogaƒçar, the win increasingly seemed more and more likely to come from these five race leaders, despite Van Aert pushing on as hard as possible in pursuit.</p>\n<p>On sector 15, Pogaƒçar suddenly opened up a colossal acceleration, forcing Bissegger to chase and then &#8211; finally &#8211; Van der Poel to accelerate. Pedersen had the extreme bad luck to puncture just as the crash happened and suddenly, with as much as 70 kilometres to go, the lead group was down to the two main pre-race contenders: Van der Poel and Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Who had the advantage? Van der Poel had the perfect excuse not to work though, given Philipsen was behind and he immediately bridged across, while Van Aert and Pedersen joined forces behind in a group of 12 also containing Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) and a very impressive Brennan, the youngest rider in the race. As the race moved into its finale, Pogaƒçar was  &#8211; for once in his career &#8211; outnumbered by his Alpecin rivals, both of them considerably more successful in a Roubaix where the UAE racer was making his debut, so had no previous experience to help him.</p>\n<p>The 60-kilometres-to-go mark, where Van der Poel had launched his winning move last year, came and went and rather than attacking instead the trio &#8211; all of them guaranteed a podium spot, after all &#8211; concentrated on refuelling and keeping their advantage open. Then on the dangerously long Mons-en-Pevele segment, five stars strong, Pogaƒçar pushed harder at the head of the trio, but neither Alpecin rider, despite Philipsen&#8217;s visible injuries, was seemingly unsettled. </p>\n<p><strong>Final sectors</strong><br />\nThat changed when Van der Poel also tested the water, and a second punch by Pogaƒçar on the Mons-en-Pevele abruptly left Philipsen, his injuries visible from his early crash, flailing at the back. Van der Poel and Pogaƒçar two continued onwards with an uneasy truce, and Van der Poel later said he expected the two of them to go all the way together to the finish. But then the real game changer happened some 40 kilometres from the finish, a sudden miscalculation at a right-angled bend on the comparatively easy sector 9 saw Pogaƒçar go flying.</p>\n<p>Fortunately unharmed, the Slovenian&#8217;s nonetheless chain came off, and he fought to put it back on, finally managing to get a replacement bike from his team car and losing 20 seconds in the process. Although blood seeped from his left wrist, he could hold his handlebars when he remounted without any difficulties, and  Pogaƒçar managed to chase on alone and undeterred, with seven sectors and 30 kilometres remaining, it looked like Van der Poel might yet have a fight on his hands.</p>\n<p>For several kilometres and in shades of Johan Museeuw&#8217;s epic pursuit of Andrei Tchmil in the much muddier conditions of the 1994 Roubaix, Pogaƒçar could see the following cars ahead and at one point the gap came down to just 16 seconds. But just like in 1994, slowly but surely Van der Poel carved open a bigger and bigger gap, and then when Pogaƒçar had a front-wheel puncture, it was effectively game over.</p>\n<p>To his immense credit, rather than sit up or wait for a chase group, World Champion forged on determinedly, although he did take the corners rather more carefully than before his crash. First in Flanders a week before, second in Roubaix in his race debut was by no means a disgrace, even if the much awaited final duel with Van der Poel had been snuffed out by his apparent miscalculation on that illfated corner.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was having issues of his own, meanwhile, after a roadside spectator opted to launch a bidon at his head on the Carrefour d&#8217;Arbre. Fortunately it had no effect and he barely paused in his effort, but the puncture that then followed looked far more spectacular, as the following car was so keen to give him his replacement bike, it ran over the one he had just dismounted.</p>\n<p>The gap on the fading Pogaƒçar did nothing but rise, though, hitting over a minute by the finish. By that time Van der Poel had gone through the near-obligatory fist-bump with his sports director in the following car, grinned at the cameras, and had more than enough time to work out his victory celebrations.</p>\n<p>Coming up to the finish line in Roubaix velodrome, Van der Poel raised three fingers to the sky to denominate his three victories in the Queen of the Classics, with the eighth Monument of his career also seeing him equal the total held by the rider who then followed him home for second.</p>\n<p>For all the 2025 edition of Paris-Roubaix saw another epic chapter of the Pogaƒçar-Van der Poel rivalry being written, the Alpecin-Deceuninck leader later denied that there was any sentiment of sporting revenge at Roubaix, following his defeat in Flanders at the hands of Pogaƒçar the previous weekend. </p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s second place is a remarkable debut for the Slovenian. In addition, Van der Poel&#8217;s third Roubaix success nonetheless is an undeniable reminder that for now in the Hell of the North at least, the Dutchman continues to rule supreme.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=8&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=8&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of cycling&#8217;s oldest races, and is one of the &#8216;Monuments&#8217; or classics of the European calendar, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking. From its beginning in 1896 until 1967, the race started in Paris and ended in Roubaix; in 1966 the start moved to Chantilly; and since 1977 it has started in Compi√®gne, about 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-east of the centre of Paris. Since 1943, the finish has for the most part taken place in the Roubaix Velodrome. The race is currently organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation, and takes place in early April, usually on the second Sunday. It has been called the Hell of the North, a Sunday in Hell (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), the Queen of the Classics or la Pascale: the Easter race. Since 1977, the winner of Paris‚ÄìRoubaix has received a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) has soared to his third straight victory in Paris-Roubaix after a crash and high-tension pursuit by Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) ended with a solo triumph for the Dutchman.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and Van der Poel were leading the race with some 40 kilometres to go when the Slovenian fell hard on a right hand bend on sector 9, suffering injuries in his left wrist and being delayed when he needed a replacement bike, with a subsequent front wheel puncture then compounding his woes.</p>\n<p>Despite having a bidon flung at his face and a late puncture of his own on the Carrefour d&#8217;Arbre forcing him to change bikes, too &#8211; with his first being run over the team car just metres behind &#8211;  Van der Poel kept his cool and rode a near-faultless finale.

Although blood seeped from his left wrist, he could hold his handlebars when he remounted without any difficulties, and  Pogaƒçar managed to chase on alone and undeterred, with seven sectors and 30 kilometres remaining, it looked like Van der Poel might yet have a fight on his hands.</p>\n<p>For several kilometres and in shades of Johan Museeuw&#8217;s epic pursuit of Andrei Tchmil in the much muddier conditions of the 1994 Roubaix, Pogaƒçar could see the following cars ahead and at one point the gap came down to just 16 seconds. But just like in 1994, slowly but surely Van der Poel carved open a bigger and bigger gap, and then when Pogaƒçar had a front-wheel puncture, it was effectively game over.</p>\n<p>To his immense credit, rather than sit up or wait for a chase group, World Champion forged on determinedly, although he did take the corners rather more carefully than before his crash. First in Flanders a week before, second in Roubaix in his race debut was by no means a disgrace, even if the much awaited final duel with Van der Poel had been snuffed out by his apparent miscalculation on that illfated corner.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was having issues of his own, meanwhile, after a roadside spectator opted to launch a bidon at his head on the Carrefour d&#8217;Arbre. Fortunately it had no effect and he barely paused in his effort, but the puncture that then followed looked far more spectacular, as the following car was so keen to give him his replacement bike, it ran over the one he had just dismounted.</p>\n<p>The gap on the fading Pogaƒçar did nothing but rise, though, hitting over a minute by the finish. By that time Van der Poel had gone through the near-obligatory fist-bump with his sports director in the following car, grinned at the cameras, and had more than enough time to work out his victory celebrations.</p>\n<p>Coming up to the finish line in Roubaix velodrome, Van der Poel raised three fingers to the sky to denominate his three victories in the Queen of the Classics, with the eighth Monument of his career also seeing him equal the total held by the rider who then followed him home for second.</p>\n<p>For all the 2025 edition of Paris-Roubaix saw another epic chapter of the Pogaƒçar-Van der Poel rivalry being written, the Alpecin-Deceuninck leader later denied that there was any sentiment of sporting revenge at Roubaix, following his defeat in Flanders at the hands of Pogaƒçar the previous weekend. </p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s second place is a remarkable debut for the Slovenian. In addition, Van der Poel&#8217;s third Roubaix success nonetheless is an undeniable reminder that for now in the Hell of the North at least, the Dutchman continues to rule supreme.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=8&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=8&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of cycling&#8217;s oldest races, and is one of the &#8216;Monuments&#8217; or classics of the European calendar, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking. From its beginning in 1896 until 1967, the race started in Paris and ended in Roubaix; in 1966 the start moved to Chantilly; and since 1977 it has started in Compi√®gne, about 85 kilometres (53 mi) north-east of the centre of Paris. Since 1943, the finish has for the most part taken place in the Roubaix Velodrome. The race is currently organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation, and takes place in early April, usually on the second Sunday. It has been called the Hell of the North, a Sunday in Hell (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), the Queen of the Classics or la Pascale: the Easter race. Since 1977, the winner of Paris‚ÄìRoubaix has received a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results U23: </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=41&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=41&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Results MJ: </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=814&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=814&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event, ranked as a 1.Pro race on the UCI ProSeries, features mostly sprinters on its roll of honour, as it is held on all-flat roads over roughly 200 kilometres.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) continued to establish himself as the fastest sprinter in the pro peloton in 2025, handily out-sprinting Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to win the Scheldeprijs for the second year in a row. Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5) finished third.</p>\n<p>A massive crash sparked by Merlier&#8217;s teammate with 12km to go fractured the peloton, leaving only a few dozen riders in contention. While Lidl-Trek led the way in for Edward Theuns, he was swamped as Philipsen opened up the sprint.</p>\n<p>Merlier showed nerves of steel as he tail-gunned the reduced peloton in the final kilometres, waiting until the final 500 metres to wind his way to the front and timed his sprint to perfection, nipping past Philipsen just before the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was a crash and gap,&#8221; Merlier said in his post-race interview. &#8220;Then I heard [Andrea] Raccagni in the radio saying was a crash, and he is behind, so he can help us anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier still had Jordi Warlop and Bart Van Lerberghe in the finale but used the latter to make his move up the side of the bunch with 1km to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With 1km to go, [Van Lerberghe] launched his lead out and did with his arm a sign that I need to find a good spot. I was a bit too long in the wind, but in the end, I still can come out and was not boxed in.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>The 113th edition of the Scheldeprijs departed from Terneuzen with mild temperatures and sunny skies. Just after the flag drop, a breakaway of eight riders went clear, gaining 3:30 or so on the peloton over the first hour of racing.</p>\n<p>With around 150km to go, the race hit an exposed section of road with crosswinds, and the peloton shattered into three main echelons behind the breakaway.</p>\n<p>The second and third splits came together quickly and set off in pursuit of the front of the peloton, 45 seconds ahead. The furious pace slashed the breakaway&#8217;s advantage, rapidly bringing it below one minute.</p>\n<p>After 40 kilometres at a brutal pace, the peloton came back together, and a breakaway of four riders &#8211; possibly composed of members from the earlier move &#8211; established a gap of 50 seconds.</p>\n<p>The breakaway included Baptiste Veistroffer (Lotto), Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB), Tijmen Eising (Beat Cycling Club) and Tuur Dens (Flanders-Baloise).</p>\n<p>With fewer riders to contribute to the attack, their gap fell to just 30 seconds with 100 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>However, once the race entered a more sheltered area of trees, the breakaway&#8217;s lead went back out to 45 seconds.</p>\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep led the peloton throughout much of the second half of the Scheldeprijs for defending champion Merlier. When the race reached the finishing circuits, the breakaway had clawed out more time, leading by 1:20 with 52km remaining.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek began to take over from Quickstep on the first of three 16.9-kilometre circuits around Schoten, bringing the gap back below the minute mark again. With 39km to go, Dens had to let his three companions go, leaving just Veistroffer, Desal and Eising</p>\n<p>With two laps to go, the breakaway&#8217;s lead was down to 48 seconds with the sprinters&#8217; teams patiently waiting to make their final surge to reel the three escapees in.</p>\n<p>Eising lost touch with the attack before the final lap, leaving Desal and Veistroffer to try to stay clear. However, once the peloton heard the bell, they quickly picked up Veistroffer and ramped up the pace for a bunch sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Desal kept riding, waiting for the catch to come &#8211; which the peloton was set to achieve until a massive crash with 12km to go disrupted proceedings. A Soudal-Quickstep rider in second wheel behind Lidl-Trek looked over his shoulder, touched wheels and fell, sparking a chain-reaction crash that rippled throughout the peloton.</p>\n<p>Several riders ended up in the culvert that ran along both sides of the long, straight road, but all most to be up and gathering themselves as the much-reduced bunch got back to work reeling Desal in, which they did just inside 10km to go.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe led the peloton across the Broekstraat cobbles but ceded to Lidl-Trek on the paved section of the run-in along the Schelde. Merlier was sitting almost at the end of the 40-rider remaining peloton but lithely slid up the right side under the 1km banner, slotting into sixth wheel behind Lidl-Trek for Theuns.</p>\n<p>Philipsen got the jump first but Merlier was much faster and powered past to claim his second consecutive Scheldeprijs victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=56&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=56&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5) finished third.</p>\n<p>A massive crash sparked by Merlier&#8217;s teammate with 12km to go fractured the peloton, leaving only a few dozen riders in contention. While Lidl-Trek led the way in for Edward Theuns, he was swamped as Philipsen opened up the sprint.</p>\n<p>Merlier showed nerves of steel as he tail-gunned the reduced peloton in the final kilometres, waiting until the final 500 metres to wind his way to the front and timed his sprint to perfection, nipping past Philipsen just before the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was a crash and gap,&#8221; Merlier said in his post-race interview. &#8220;Then I heard [Andrea] Raccagni in the radio saying was a crash, and he is behind, so he can help us anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier still had Jordi Warlop and Bart Van Lerberghe in the finale but used the latter to make his move up the side of the bunch with 1km to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With 1km to go, [Van Lerberghe] launched his lead out and did with his arm a sign that I need to find a good spot. I was a bit too long in the wind, but in the end, I still can come out and was not boxed in.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>The 113th edition of the Scheldeprijs departed from Terneuzen with mild temperatures and sunny skies. Just after the flag drop, a breakaway of eight riders went clear, gaining 3:30 or so on the peloton over the first hour of racing.</p>\n<p>With around 150km to go, the race hit an exposed section of road with crosswinds, and the peloton shattered into three main echelons behind the breakaway.</p>\n<p>The second and third splits came together quickly and set off in pursuit of the front of the peloton, 45 seconds ahead. The furious pace slashed the breakaway&#8217;s advantage, rapidly bringing it below one minute.</p>\n<p>After 40 kilometres at a brutal pace, the peloton came back together, and a breakaway of four riders &#8211; possibly composed of members from the earlier move &#8211; established a gap of 50 seconds.</p>\n<p>The breakaway included Baptiste Veistroffer (Lotto), Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB), Tijmen Eising (Beat Cycling Club) and Tuur Dens (Flanders-Baloise).</p>\n<p>With fewer riders to contribute to the attack, their gap fell to just 30 seconds with 100 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>However, once the race entered a more sheltered area of trees, the breakaway&#8217;s lead went back out to 45 seconds.</p>\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep led the peloton throughout much of the second half of the Scheldeprijs for defending champion Merlier. When the race reached the finishing circuits, the breakaway had clawed out more time, leading by 1:20 with 52km remaining.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek began to take over from Quickstep on the first of three 16.9-kilometre circuits around Schoten, bringing the gap back below the minute mark again. With 39km to go, Dens had to let his three companions go, leaving just Veistroffer, Desal and Eising</p>\n<p>With two laps to go, the breakaway&#8217;s lead was down to 48 seconds with the sprinters&#8217; teams patiently waiting to make their final surge to reel the three escapees in.</p>\n<p>Eising lost touch with the attack before the final lap, leaving Desal and Veistroffer to try to stay clear. However, once the peloton heard the bell, they quickly picked up Veistroffer and ramped up the pace for a bunch sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Desal kept riding, waiting for the catch to come &#8211; which the peloton was set to achieve until a massive crash with 12km to go disrupted proceedings. A Soudal-Quickstep rider in second wheel behind Lidl-Trek looked over his shoulder, touched wheels and fell, sparking a chain-reaction crash that rippled throughout the peloton.</p>\n<p>Several riders ended up in the culvert that ran along both sides of the long, straight road, but all most to be up and gathering themselves as the much-reduced bunch got back to work reeling Desal in, which they did just inside 10km to go.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe led the peloton across the Broekstraat cobbles but ceded to Lidl-Trek on the paved section of the run-in along the Schelde. Merlier was sitting almost at the end of the 40-rider remaining peloton but lithely slid up the right side under the 1km banner, slotting into sixth wheel behind Lidl-Trek for Theuns.</p>\n<p>Philipsen got the jump first but Merlier was much faster and powered past to claim his second consecutive Scheldeprijs victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=56&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=56&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is an annual road bicycle racing event in Flanders, Belgium, held in early April. It is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, on much of the same roads but at a shorter distance. The event has been held annually since 2004 on the same day as the men&#8217;s race. From 2004 to 2015 it was part of the UCI Women&#8217;s Road World Cup. Since 2016, the race is included in the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier female elite competition. Since the first edition, organisers have included more climbs and extended the race gradually from 94 km in the first edition to 163 km in 2024.</p>\n<p>World champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) won the Tour of Flanders Women, beating Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Liane Lippert (Movistar), and Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) in a sprint of four riders in the elite lead group.</p>\n<p>The quartet had attacked from a group of 17 riders on the Oude Kwaremont, kept the pace up on the Paterberg and then worked together on the run-in to Oudenaarde to hold off the chasers.</p>\n<p>In the final kilometre, Niewiadoma tried to anticipate the sprint with an attack but sat up again when Kopecky closed the gap.</p>\n<p>Kopecky then controlled the group from the front, launching her sprint with just over 200 metres to go when Lippert got out of the saddle to sprint and keeping everybody behind her to win her third Tour of Flanders title.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy race with lots of crashes in the beginning,&#8221; said Kopecky after her victory. &#8220;It was pretty nervous, and I didn‚Äôt have the best legs in the beginning, but I tried to stay calm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a few climbs, my legs felt better and better, then I knew that in the end, I have a pretty good chance. Once we were with the four of us, I was pretty confident, actually. </p>\n<p>&#8220;After an hour or two, I felt good, so from that moment on, I knew that it was much better than Wednesday, so I just had to be confident. Once we got further into the race, Mischa [Bredewold] was out before the Oude Kruisberg, that was a really good move for us, so I think, again, with our team SD Worx-Protime, we did a really nice race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>The early breakaway formed soon after the start of the 168.9-kilometre race when Nicole Steigenga (AG Insurance-Soudal), Franziska Brau√üe (Ceratizit), Romy Kasper (Human Powered Health), Alison Avoine (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93), Britt de Grave (DD Group), April Tacey (Coop-Repsol), and Aoife O&#8217;Brien (DAS-Hutchinson) got away. Their advantage maxed out at over seven minutes before coming down again.</p>\n<p>There were numerous crashes in the peloton, and 2024 race winner Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) was the most prominent victim, having to abandon the race. Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) and Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) also hit the ground but were able to continue.</p>\n<p>After the Berendries, only Steigenga, Brau√üe, De Grave, and Tacey were left in front, with the peloton just over four minutes behind. Jade Wiel (FDJ-Suez) attacked from the bunch on the Valkenberg, initiating a flurry of moves that led to a chase group of ten riders, but this group was short-lived.</p>\n<p>Steigenga went solo on the Eikenberg with 52km to go, leaving her companions behind and starting the Koppenberg with a 30-second lead on Tacey while the peloton followed at 1:46 minutes. Unlike last year, the cobbles were dry, and there was no mass dismount as most riders could ride up the steep climb ‚Äì a notable exception was Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>17 riders were still together after the Koppenberg, with another 24 riders returning before the next climb, the Steenbeekdries, where Steigenga was caught. On the cobbled descent of the Stationsberg, Elise Chabbey, Amber Kraak (both FDJ-Suez), and Ferrand-Pr√©vot crashed in a corner, but were soon back on their bikes.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek lit up the race after the Taaienberg as Ellen van Dijk, Anna Henderson, and Lauretta Hanson took turns attacking. The Australian succeeded in getting away with Bredewold, and they held a 20-second gap going into the Oude Kruisberg.</p>\n<p>Lippert attacked on this cobbled climb, bridging to Hanson and Bredewold. Pieterse then used the Hotond to close the gap to the trio, putting 17 riders at the front of the race. They included Van Dijk, Henderson, Hanson (all  Lidl-Trek), Anna van der Breggen, Kopecky, Bredewold (all SD Worx-Protime), Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, Marlen Reusser (both Movistar), Noemi R√ºegg, Letizia Borghesi (both EF Education-Oatly), Letizia Paternoster (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Niewiadoma, Chlo√© Dygert (both Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Pieterse, Chabbey, and Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal).</p>\n<p>Dygert, Van Dijk, and Henderson all attacked on the run-in to the Oude Kwaremont but could not get away. Instead, Reusser led the group onto the key climb of the race, and when the cobbles began and the gradients hit, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, and Kopecky pulled away from the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>Henderson and Chabbey unsuccessfully tried to get back on. Paternoster had almost made it to Kopecky‚Äôs rear when Niewiadoma passed her and closed the last gap, but when Kopecky pushed the pace on the flatter second half of the climb, Paternoster blew apart and dropped back, leaving four riders at the front, 12 seconds ahead of the next group.</p>\n<p>The gap had increased slightly to 15 seconds at the foot of the Paterberg where Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Niewiadoma hit hard from the bottom, wanting to keep the chase group away and maybe drop some of the other frontrunners. Lippert replied and came to the front on the last part of the climb while Kopecky was content to follow the others‚Äô wheels.</p>\n<p>The headwind on the run-in to the finish Oudenaarde discouraged attacks, and the four riders seemed happy to work together until the flamme rouge, extending their advantage to over a minute. After Niewiadoma‚Äôs attack, Kopecky led out the sprint to take a record third Tour of Flanders victory, and 1:13 minutes later, Le Court won the sprint for fifth place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Jade Wiel (FDJ-Suez) attacked from the bunch on the Valkenberg, initiating a flurry of moves that led to a chase group of ten riders, but this group was short-lived.</p>\n<p>Steigenga went solo on the Eikenberg with 52km to go, leaving her companions behind and starting the Koppenberg with a 30-second lead on Tacey while the peloton followed at 1:46 minutes. Unlike last year, the cobbles were dry, and there was no mass dismount as most riders could ride up the steep climb ‚Äì a notable exception was Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>17 riders were still together after the Koppenberg, with another 24 riders returning before the next climb, the Steenbeekdries, where Steigenga was caught. On the cobbled descent of the Stationsberg, Elise Chabbey, Amber Kraak (both FDJ-Suez), and Ferrand-Pr√©vot crashed in a corner, but were soon back on their bikes.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek lit up the race after the Taaienberg as Ellen van Dijk, Anna Henderson, and Lauretta Hanson took turns attacking. The Australian succeeded in getting away with Bredewold, and they held a 20-second gap going into the Oude Kruisberg.</p>\n<p>Lippert attacked on this cobbled climb, bridging to Hanson and Bredewold. Pieterse then used the Hotond to close the gap to the trio, putting 17 riders at the front of the race. They included Van Dijk, Henderson, Hanson (all  Lidl-Trek), Anna van der Breggen, Kopecky, Bredewold (all SD Worx-Protime), Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, Marlen Reusser (both Movistar), Noemi R√ºegg, Letizia Borghesi (both EF Education-Oatly), Letizia Paternoster (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Niewiadoma, Chlo√© Dygert (both Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Pieterse, Chabbey, and Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal).</p>\n<p>Dygert, Van Dijk, and Henderson all attacked on the run-in to the Oude Kwaremont but could not get away. Instead, Reusser led the group onto the key climb of the race, and when the cobbles began and the gradients hit, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, and Kopecky pulled away from the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>Henderson and Chabbey unsuccessfully tried to get back on. Paternoster had almost made it to Kopecky‚Äôs rear when Niewiadoma passed her and closed the last gap, but when Kopecky pushed the pace on the flatter second half of the climb, Paternoster blew apart and dropped back, leaving four riders at the front, 12 seconds ahead of the next group.</p>\n<p>The gap had increased slightly to 15 seconds at the foot of the Paterberg where Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Niewiadoma hit hard from the bottom, wanting to keep the chase group away and maybe drop some of the other frontrunners. Lippert replied and came to the front on the last part of the climb while Kopecky was content to follow the others‚Äô wheels.</p>\n<p>The headwind on the run-in to the finish Oudenaarde discouraged attacks, and the four riders seemed happy to work together until the flamme rouge, extending their advantage to over a minute. After Niewiadoma‚Äôs attack, Kopecky led out the sprint to take a record third Tour of Flanders victory, and 1:13 minutes later, Le Court won the sprint for fifth place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The most important cycling race in Flanders, it is part of the UCI World Tour and organized by Flanders Classics. Its nickname is Vlaanderens Mooiste (Dutch for &#8220;Flanders&#8217; Finest&#8221;). First held in 1913. </p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) soloed to his second Tour of Flanders title in a race of many attacks, leaving his rivals behind on the Oude Kwaremont to race to a 19km solo victory in Oudenaarde.</p>\n<p>The world champion left behind a select group of favourites, including Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike), and the Lidl-Trek duo of Mads Pedersen and Jasper Stuyven on the penultimate climb of the 269km race to seal his eighth Monument win.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar, who had traded blows with Van der Poel since the first ascent of the Oude Kwaremont at 55km to go, pushed on to a 30-second lead over the final hill of the day, the Paterberg, a lead he defended on the flat 13km run to the finish to win by 1:01.</p>\n<p>Second place was taken in a sprint from the four-man chase group by Pedersen, the second runner-up spot of his career. The Dane jumped from the rear of the quartet to beat Van der Poel to the line, who stood on the podium for the sixth time in seven starts.</p>\n<p>Van Aert and Stuyven rounded out the top five, while Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease A Bike) was the next man to finish, 1:51 behind the champion.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe goal was to win but in the end it‚Äôs hard to realise it. We did it and I cannot be more proud of the team and how we raced today, even though we had some bad luck. But in the end, all was good and I‚Äôm so happy to win this race in this jersey,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe plan was to go from [Oude Kwaremont] and we always followed the plan, even if we had some crashes in the team with my teammates. We made it and we stuck to it and we finished it off.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere was a crash on the big road. I think Mathieu crashed there. We lost Jhonatan [Narv√°ez], Tim [Wellens] and Florian [Vermeersch] as well. Florian somehow chased back all race more or less and made it just in time to lead out on the Kwaremont, so chapeau to him. We never gave up; all the riders were coming back. They went above themselves to do the plan and even with the setbacks they did it perfectly.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúRoubaix is a completely different race but I will accept the challenge, and I‚Äôll try to do my best. I know that Flanders suits me a bit better, but you never know. Roubaix is also a very hard race, and I think that with the shape I have now, I should give it a try.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 109th edition of the Tour of Flanders headed back to Bruges for the start this year, sending the riders on a winding 269km course south to Oudenaarde.</p>\n<p>Along the way, the 174 riders of the peloton would face 19 major climbs and cobbled sectors, including the Koppenberg, three ascents of the Oude Kwaremont, and two of the Paterberg. The Kwaremont-Paterberg duo would feature as the final tests of the race ahead of a 13km flat run towards the finish.</p>\n<p>Following the roll-out in Bruges, the attacks flew from the start, but it would take 30km before the main breakaway of the day was formed at the front.</p>\n<p>An eight-man group jumped clear of the peloton to form the break. Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Elmar Reinders (Jayco-AlUla), Alessandro Romele (XDS-Astana), Rory Townsend (Q36.5), Marco Haller (Tudor), Victor Vercouillie (Flanders-Baloise) and the Picnic-PostNL duo of Sean Flynn and Timo Roosen made up the move.</p>\n<p>Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB) and Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost) just missed the move, but the pair continued to ride on together in a battle to make the break a 10-man move.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, Mikkel Bjerg and Silvan Dillier took up the pacemaking at the front for UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Alpecin-Deceuninck.</p>\n<p>The pair, representing the two top favourites for victory in Tadej Pogaƒçar and Mathieu van der Poel, left the break to ride four minutes up the road, while Reynders and Walker remained locked in what turned out to be a fruitless chase behind the break.</p>\n<p>The pair would battle on until the first cobbled sector of the race at Doorn with 157km to go. There, they were brought back by the peloton, just before the riders passed through Oudenaarde for the first time, 15km ahead of the first passage of the Oude Kwaremont.</p>\n<p>It was Romele, riding his first Monument, who led the race over the famous hill, while back in the peloton, Lidl-Trek and their leader Mads Pedersen had moved up to the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the second climb of the day, the Eikenberg, a crash took John Degenkolb (Picnic-PostNL) and Adrien Petit (Intermarch√©-Wanty) out of the race, also catching out Van der Poel. The Dutchman wasn‚Äôt badly affected having fallen on the grass, however, and was back in the peloton within 10km of the crash.</p>\n<p>At the Molenberg, 110km out, Davide Ballerini (XDS-Astana) jumped off the front of the peloton, taking Vito Braet (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), and Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease A Bike) with him in a strong four-man move.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, another strong group of riders jumped away, with Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) joined by Daan Hoole (Lidl-Trek), Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck), and Matteo Trentin (Tudor).</p>\n<p>The two groups merged together just inside the final 100km, and then linked up with the early breakaway on the run towards Berendries to make it a 14-man move. Back in the peloton, UAE Team Emirates-XRG massed on the front in response, with the enlarged break now lying a minute up the road.</p>\n<p>With 87km to go, the number in the break dropped to 13 as neo-pro Romele dropped back, while at the front Swift led the way for Ganna as the break‚Äôs advantage grew to 1:15. Back in the peloton, Van der Poel made a quick scheduled stop to get back on his original race bike, which he had swapped out for a spare following the earlier crash.</p>\n<p>On the road to the second ascent of Oude Kwaremont, the following ascents of Valkenberg, Berg Ten Houte, and Nieuwe Kruisberg/Hotond passed without incident, with the peloton hitting the Kwaremont 45 seconds down on the break.</p>\n<p><strong>The final</strong><br />\nIt was on the Oude Kwaremont, with 55km to go, that Pogaƒçar struck the first blow of the day, attacking at the front. He took Visma-Lease A Bike pair Matteo Jorgenson and Wout van Aert and Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) with him. Van der Poel, having initially been caught out of position further back, also joined in the move.</p>\n<p>Up front, the break had disintegrated to leave six up front at the top of the hill ‚Äì Ganna, K√ºng, Trentin, Benoot, Hoole, Ballerini, and Haller ‚Äì Pogaƒçar‚Äôs move had cut the gap to just 26 seconds.</p>\n<p>At the base of the Paterberg, the peloton made it back across to Pogaƒçar and Van der Poel‚Äôs group, but not for long. On the way up, it was Van der Poel‚Äôs time to jump, putting in an acceleration that only Pogaƒçar could match.</p>\n<p>Pedersen came across on the descent, while his teammate Jasper Stuyven and the Visma pair of Jorgenson and Van Aert made it six off the front heading into the final 50km. Three more riders ‚Äì Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Yevgeniy Fedorov (XDS-Astana), and Arjen Livyns (Lotto) came across on the run to the Koppenberg, which the group hit just seconds behind the break.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and Van der Poel once again showed themselves as the strongest in the move on the way up, though it all came back together shortly afterwards to leave a 13-man group at the head of the race ‚Äì minus Powless, Fedorov, and Livyns.</p>\n<p>Further attacks from Pogaƒçar on the Stationsberg and Taaienberg left the world champion alone out front with just Van der Poel and Pedersen for company. Behind them, the Visma trio, Stuyven, and K√ºng led the chase.</p>\n<p>On the Oude Kruisberg/Hotond, Pedersen was dropped by another Pogaƒçar-Van der Poel acceleration, with the former world champion soon joined by Stuyven and a solo Van Aert in the chase group.</p>\n<p>They‚Äôd come together as a leading quintet at 24km to go, in time for the final ascent of the Oude Kwaremont. Van Aert went solo again on the lead-in to the hill, pushing on at the front of the race to lead the way up.</p>\n<p>But it was there that Pogaƒçar made his final big move. His acceleration went unmatched among the group of favourites, with even Van der Poel being forced to concede. At the top of the hill, he was away and on the road to another victory.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the quartet he had left behind rolled through to take their turns on the front in the chase. But the win was already gone, with Pogaƒçar only gaining time as the kilometres ticked down.</p>\n<p>As Pogaƒçar began his celebrations on the home straight, the chase group began fighting among themselves with an attack by Stuyven at 2km to go. The podium places would come down to a sprint among the four chasers, with Stuyven leading it out and Pedersen at the back.</p>\n<p>The former world champion jumped first to take second place, with Van der Poel reacting but being unable to match the final acceleration. The Dutchman did, however, hold off Van Aert‚Äôs sprint to grab the second step on the podium ahead of his longtime rival.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=5&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=5&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) won the sprint for fifth place at 45 seconds, after unsuccessfully trying to chase the attack down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t believe it, &#8220;Powless said in disbelief after shouting and hugging teammates and staff at the finish line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really strong today but I didn&#8217;t think I had any chance to win from that group. I thought I was riding for second place. I just can&#8217;t believe it, I&#8217;m so happy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a rough spring for me so far, but today I&#8217;m so happy to be back where I know I can be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Powless has won the Clasica San Sebastian and other one-day races but this was special and gives him huge confidence for the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the biggest win of my life,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope I can fight for the win [on Sunday], at least fight for the podium. In these races, you need a bit of luck, but you also need confidence, so I definitely gained one of those today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Powless opted to ride with Van Aert, Benoot and Jorgenson in the attack, knowing he always had a chance in the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a constant inner struggle, even for my director in the car, he was going back and forth on whether or not I should ride because we had quite a few numbers behind,&#8221; Powless explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really good. I felt really solid on the cobbles, so I didn&#8217;t want to sprint from a bigger group. It was a rock and a hard place but I&#8217;m proud of the way I rode.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Powless rode an intelligent sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought Wout what was going to be the strongest in the sprint, they were really betting on him but I never thought in a million years I would beat him in a sprint, in a race like this,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came in with a little more speed in the final corner and I was three or four kilometres an hour faster than Wout when he started this sprint. I just went all the way to the line and I was able to carry the speed quite well. There&#8217;s not a lot of space between that last corner and the finish line so I just had to start my sprints immediately and pray.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nDwars door Vlaanderen was raced at a record speed of 46.587 km/h due to strong cross and tailwinds and clear spring-like blue skies. </p>\n<p>Strangely no break got away for the first 60km but then the race soon exploded.  </p>\n<p>Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Joshua Giddings (Lotto), Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team), Rasmus Pedersen (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB) and Petr Kelemen (Tudor Pro Cycling) eventually opened a gap but never gained more than a minute.</p>\n<p>On the Knokteberg climb, with 91km to race, Van Aert made his intentions clear and soon shook out the peloton, creating a front chase group. </p>\n<p>Pedersen also tried to be aggressive but was kept in check. Then a counter-attack came from Powless, Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) and Fabio Vandenbossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck) got away as riders tried to anticipate any major selection.   </p>\n<p>The three joined Danish duo Pedersen and Bjerg up front but another major change was coming. On the approach to the Berg Ten Houte climb with 56km to race, Van Aert, Benoot, Jorgenson, plus Edoardo Affini and Dylan van Baarle hit the front and gapped the peloton in the crosswind in perfect Flemish racing.  </p>\n<p>Van Aert, Benoot, Jorgenson and Affini then powered on, with the Italian doing a huge turn until he was distanced on the second climb of the Knokteberg. They caught the attackers but only Powless could stay with them. </p>\n<p>The peloton refused to give up for a long time, with Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers), Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) and others driving the chase and trying to convince others to help them.</p>\n<p>For 20km the time gap remained below 30 seconds. Then the chase lost conviction and the Visma trio and Powless gained confidence.</p>\n<p>A crash saw Nils Politt (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) go down hard before the flat cobbled roads made for a spectacular finale and little doubt that Visma-Lease a Bike would pull off the victory. </p>\n<p>Powless tried to miss some turns, but Benoot forced him to help by taking him out of the back of the attack with 25km to go. The American knew it was better for him to collaborate and then try his chances, even in a three-to-one finish.  </p>\n<p>Visma decided to stay together and ride to the finish to set up Van Aert instead of attacking Powless but this proved to be their undoing. </p>\n<p>Powless was strong and out to win. He managed to sit on Van Aert&#8217;s wheel into the fast-sweeping final corner and had more speed in the acceleration to the line. </p>\n<p>From what seemed like a sure defeat, Powless snatched the biggest and most dramatic victory of his career. For Van Aert and Visma-Lease a Bike, it was one of their biggest defeats. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=75&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=75&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In these races, you need a bit of luck, but you also need confidence, so I definitely gained one of those today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Powless opted to ride with Van Aert, Benoot and Jorgenson in the attack, knowing he always had a chance in the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a constant inner struggle, even for my director in the car, he was going back and forth on whether or not I should ride because we had quite a few numbers behind,&#8221; Powless explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really good. I felt really solid on the cobbles, so I didn&#8217;t want to sprint from a bigger group. It was a rock and a hard place but I&#8217;m proud of the way I rode.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Powless rode an intelligent sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought Wout what was going to be the strongest in the sprint, they were really betting on him but I never thought in a million years I would beat him in a sprint, in a race like this,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came in with a little more speed in the final corner and I was three or four kilometres an hour faster than Wout when he started this sprint. I just went all the way to the line and I was able to carry the speed quite well. There&#8217;s not a lot of space between that last corner and the finish line so I just had to start my sprints immediately and pray.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nDwars door Vlaanderen was raced at a record speed of 46.587 km/h due to strong cross and tailwinds and clear spring-like blue skies. </p>\n<p>Strangely no break got away for the first 60km but then the race soon exploded.  </p>\n<p>Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Joshua Giddings (Lotto), Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team), Rasmus Pedersen (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB) and Petr Kelemen (Tudor Pro Cycling) eventually opened a gap but never gained more than a minute.</p>\n<p>On the Knokteberg climb, with 91km to race, Van Aert made his intentions clear and soon shook out the peloton, creating a front chase group. </p>\n<p>Pedersen also tried to be aggressive but was kept in check. Then a counter-attack came from Powless, Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) and Fabio Vandenbossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck) got away as riders tried to anticipate any major selection.   </p>\n<p>The three joined Danish duo Pedersen and Bjerg up front but another major change was coming. On the approach to the Berg Ten Houte climb with 56km to race, Van Aert, Benoot, Jorgenson, plus Edoardo Affini and Dylan van Baarle hit the front and gapped the peloton in the crosswind in perfect Flemish racing.  </p>\n<p>Van Aert, Benoot, Jorgenson and Affini then powered on, with the Italian doing a huge turn until he was distanced on the second climb of the Knokteberg. They caught the attackers but only Powless could stay with them. </p>\n<p>The peloton refused to give up for a long time, with Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers), Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) and others driving the chase and trying to convince others to help them.</p>\n<p>For 20km the time gap remained below 30 seconds. Then the chase lost conviction and the Visma trio and Powless gained confidence.</p>\n<p>A crash saw Nils Politt (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) go down hard before the flat cobbled roads made for a spectacular finale and little doubt that Visma-Lease a Bike would pull off the victory. </p>\n<p>Powless tried to miss some turns, but Benoot forced him to help by taking him out of the back of the attack with 25km to go. The American knew it was better for him to collaborate and then try his chances, even in a three-to-one finish.  </p>\n<p>Visma decided to stay together and ride to the finish to set up Van Aert instead of attacking Powless but this proved to be their undoing. </p>\n<p>Powless was strong and out to win. He managed to sit on Van Aert&#8217;s wheel into the fast-sweeping final corner and had more speed in the acceleration to the line. </p>\n<p>From what seemed like a sure defeat, Powless snatched the biggest and most dramatic victory of his career. For Van Aert and Visma-Lease a Bike, it was one of their biggest defeats. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=75&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=75&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of the classic races part of the Flemish Cycling Week, run in late March on the last Sunday before the Tour of Flanders. Although the event is often called a sprinters&#8217; classic due to its flat finishing terrain, its early-season date means riders are often tested by wind and rain, as well as several climbs, including two ascents of the steep and fully cobbled Kemmelberg. As a result, few editions of Gent‚ÄìWevelgem actually end in a bunch sprint ‚Äì often the winner comes from a small group of escapees. Since 2012 a woman&#8217;s event is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, included in the inaugural UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour in 2016.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won Gent-Wevelgem, taking the 100th victory of her career. Launching her sprint with 200 metres to go from the wheel of her teammate, world champion Lotte Kopecky, Wiebes was untouchable, with Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) and Charlotte Kool (Picnic-PostNL) not even trying to come around her and settling for second and third.</p>\n<p>Kopecky had ridden hard up the second ascent of the Kemmelberg, splitting the peloton and initiating a front group of five that also included Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), Wiebes, Letizia Borghesi (EF Education-Oatly), and Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>But Longo Borghini was not taking any turns, and they were only 15 seconds ahead of the peloton where Lidl-Trek were chasing hard. Wiebes and Kopecky attacked in turns to make Longo Borghini chase, and the two groups eventually merged with 27km to go.</p>\n<p>Although there was no shortage of attacks on the run-in to Wevelgem and Lidl-Trek even tried to force echelons, nobody got away for longer than a few seconds, and when the sprinters&#8217; teams took control, a bunch sprint was inevitable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good on the Kemmelberg.

Actually, she went really long with the lead-out so that at one point I was like, &#8216;yeah, I start now&#8217;,&#8221; Wiebes said about the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe break of the day consisted of Katia Ragusa (Human Powered Health), Beatrice Caudera (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni), Maaike Boogaard (VolkerWessels), Britt de Grave, Cleo Kiekens (both DD Group), Franziska Brau√üe (Ceratizit), and Mia Griffin (Roland). They built an advantage of over four minutes before the peloton took up the chase.</p>\n<p>A crash in De Moeren split the peloton and forced Nienke Veenhoven (Visma-Lease a Bike) to abandon. The two groups came back together before the race was split again in a crosswind section. At the 100km mark, though, the peloton was together again.</p>\n<p>They were up to 24 seconds ahead but were caught again atop the Baneberg, 40km from the line and five kilometres from the second time up the Kemmelberg, this time on the shorter but steeper west side called the Ossuaire.</p>\n<p>Again, Kopecky went hard from the bottom, and only Longo Borghini and Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) could follow her at first before Wiebes, Borghesi, and Dygert made it back to their wheels near the top.

As a result, few editions of Gent‚ÄìWevelgem actually end in a bunch sprint ‚Äì often the winner comes from a small group of escapees.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) claimed his third career victory in Gent-Wevelgem with a stunning display of power and tenacity.</p>\n<p>Pedersen took the race in hand early, attacking 72 kilometres from the finish to bridge across to the day&#8217;s early breakaway, then pushing all of his chips in with a solo attack on the Kemmelberg with 56km to go.</p>\n<p>The peloton, previously shattered in the crosswinds of De Moeren, could hardly make a dent in the Dane&#8217;s 90-second advantage in the last hour of racing thanks to a tailwind and the work of the rest of Lidl-Trek, who sat behind the few chasers, effectively disrupting their pursuit.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek led out Jonathan Milan in the bunch sprint for the final podium spots, but Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) outpaced the Italian who hit out a bit too early. Milan had to settle for third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy. I never expected to be able to do something like this,&#8221; Pedersen said. &#8220;To win here again is super nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was in favour of being alone with the full tailwind in the last 20k. On the plugstreets I had really good legs, so I was like &#8216;OK, let&#8217;s try to open the race&#8217;. And then, it was the point of no return. This could have ended in shit also, but today it went well, so luckily it was a good decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pedersen, who finished second behind Tour of Flanders rival Mathieu van der Poel in the E3 Saxo Classic two days previously, equalled the record of Gent-Wevelgem victories of Tom Boonen and Eddy Merckx. He played down what his win one week before De Ronde means, however, with Van der Poel and Tadej Pogaƒçar absent from today&#8217;s race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a different race than this is, and you know, those two guys are still on a different level,&#8221; Pedersen said. &#8220;We saw it Friday with Mathieu. He just dropped me on the Kwaremont. And we also know Tadej is a pretty good bike rider, so he he&#8217;s able to do the same. Of course this gives some confidence for Sunday, and we believe we can win, but it&#8217;s not going to be easy at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier, who crashed during the Classic Brugge-De Panne and had to get stitches in his knee, revealed that he was opposed to starting Gent-Wevelgem today but his sports director Iljo Keisse put him on the start line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After Wednesday, I said to Iljo, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to start today because I never can be ready&#8217;. But he left me on the list and brought me over here. So in the end, I need to say thank you to Iljo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier had to fight against Milan in a full-out sprint for almost 300 metres, ultimately pulling ahead just before the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really fast, but I know where he never gives up, so in the end, it was a long sprint next to each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Milan admitted he hit out too early in the sprint, &#8220;I finished the third but I&#8217;m still happy for this podium.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nClear skies and a stiff breeze greeted the peloton in Ypres for the start of the 87th edition of Gent-Wevelgem with 250.3 kilometres of cobbles, dirt &#8216;plugstreets&#8217; and bergs.</p>\n<p>Jules Hester (Flanders-Baloise) kicked off the hostilities but a counterattack from Sam Maisonobe (Cofidis), Jasha S√ºtterlin (Jayco-AlUla), Marco Haller (Tudor) and Emƒ´ls Liepi≈Ü≈° (Q36.5) went clear.</p>\n<p>Another attack from Victor Vercouillie (Flanders-Baloise), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost), Samuel Leroux and Alexys Brunel (TotalEnergies), Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates XRG) emerged from the peloton and joined the first breakaway with 228km to go.</p>\n<p>The leaders gained nearly four minutes before their advantage began to come down after 80 kilometres of racing.</p>\n<p>Crosswinds hit the peloton after 100 kilometres of racing, with Lidl-Trek driving the pace to leave sprinters like Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) behind.</p>\n<p>De Lie abandoned the race, but Merlier sent his team to the front to close the gap. The action brought the escapees within one minute before the first two echelons merged with 103km to go.</p>\n<p>Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked with Johan Jacobs (Groupama-FDJ) soon after, but the Swiss rider couldn&#8217;t hold the wheel of the former Hour Record holder on the Baneberg and dropped back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Campenaerts made it to the leaders before the Monteberg with 94km to go.

It is one of the classic races part of the Flemish Cycling Week, run in late March on the last Sunday before the Tour of Flanders. Although the event is often called a sprinters&#8217; classic due to its flat finishing terrain, its early-season date means riders are often tested by wind and rain, as well as several climbs, including two ascents of the steep and fully cobbled Kemmelberg. As a result, few editions of Gent‚ÄìWevelgem actually end in a bunch sprint ‚Äì often the winner comes from a small group of escapees.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) claimed his third career victory in Gent-Wevelgem with a stunning display of power and tenacity.</p>\n<p>Pedersen took the race in hand early, attacking 72 kilometres from the finish to bridge across to the day&#8217;s early breakaway, then pushing all of his chips in with a solo attack on the Kemmelberg with 56km to go.</p>\n<p>The peloton, previously shattered in the crosswinds of De Moeren, could hardly make a dent in the Dane&#8217;s 90-second advantage in the last hour of racing thanks to a tailwind and the work of the rest of Lidl-Trek, who sat behind the few chasers, effectively disrupting their pursuit.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek led out Jonathan Milan in the bunch sprint for the final podium spots, but Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) outpaced the Italian who hit out a bit too early. Milan had to settle for third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy. I never expected to be able to do something like this,&#8221; Pedersen said. &#8220;To win here again is super nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was in favour of being alone with the full tailwind in the last 20k. On the plugstreets I had really good legs, so I was like &#8216;OK, let&#8217;s try to open the race&#8217;. And then, it was the point of no return. This could have ended in shit also, but today it went well, so luckily it was a good decision.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pedersen, who finished second behind Tour of Flanders rival Mathieu van der Poel in the E3 Saxo Classic two days previously, equalled the record of Gent-Wevelgem victories of Tom Boonen and Eddy Merckx. He played down what his win one week before De Ronde means, however, with Van der Poel and Tadej Pogaƒçar absent from today&#8217;s race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a different race than this is, and you know, those two guys are still on a different level,&#8221; Pedersen said. &#8220;We saw it Friday with Mathieu. He just dropped me on the Kwaremont. And we also know Tadej is a pretty good bike rider, so he he&#8217;s able to do the same. Of course this gives some confidence for Sunday, and we believe we can win, but it&#8217;s not going to be easy at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier, who crashed during the Classic Brugge-De Panne and had to get stitches in his knee, revealed that he was opposed to starting Gent-Wevelgem today but his sports director Iljo Keisse put him on the start line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After Wednesday, I said to Iljo, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to start today because I never can be ready&#8217;. But he left me on the list and brought me over here. So in the end, I need to say thank you to Iljo.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier had to fight against Milan in a full-out sprint for almost 300 metres, ultimately pulling ahead just before the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really fast, but I know where he never gives up, so in the end, it was a long sprint next to each other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Milan admitted he hit out too early in the sprint, &#8220;I finished the third but I&#8217;m still happy for this podium.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nClear skies and a stiff breeze greeted the peloton in Ypres for the start of the 87th edition of Gent-Wevelgem with 250.3 kilometres of cobbles, dirt &#8216;plugstreets&#8217; and bergs.</p>\n<p>Jules Hester (Flanders-Baloise) kicked off the hostilities but a counterattack from Sam Maisonobe (Cofidis), Jasha S√ºtterlin (Jayco-AlUla), Marco Haller (Tudor) and Emƒ´ls Liepi≈Ü≈° (Q36.5) went clear.</p>\n<p>Another attack from Victor Vercouillie (Flanders-Baloise), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost), Samuel Leroux and Alexys Brunel (TotalEnergies), Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates XRG) emerged from the peloton and joined the first breakaway with 228km to go.</p>\n<p>The leaders gained nearly four minutes before their advantage began to come down after 80 kilometres of racing.</p>\n<p>Crosswinds hit the peloton after 100 kilometres of racing, with Lidl-Trek driving the pace to leave sprinters like Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) behind.</p>\n<p>De Lie abandoned the race, but Merlier sent his team to the front to close the gap. The action brought the escapees within one minute before the first two echelons merged with 103km to go.</p>\n<p>Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked with Johan Jacobs (Groupama-FDJ) soon after, but the Swiss rider couldn&#8217;t hold the wheel of the former Hour Record holder on the Baneberg and dropped back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Campenaerts made it to the leaders before the Monteberg with 94km to go. On the first ascent of the Kemmelberg, Vercouillie and Leroux lost touch while behind, a probing attack from Pedersen pulled away a small group but it was closed down quickly.</p>\n<p>Pedersen attacked again on the section of three plugstreets with 72km to go and was joined by Arjen Livyns (Lotto) to bridge across to the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Philipsen suffered a puncture at the worst possible moment and had to fight his way back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Pedersen made his way to the remnants of the early breakaway with 63km to go, making it nine again, while behind, Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) crashed out of the race.</p>\n<p>The breakaway had a minute on the chasing peloton with 60km to go.

Since 2018 it is raced over two days with a men&#8217;s race on Wednesday and a women&#8217;s race on Thursday. Both races start in Bruges and finish in the seaside resort of De Panne. The women&#8217;s event is included in the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour; the men&#8217;s race was part of the UCI Europe Tour as a 1.HC event, but was promoted to the UCI World Tour as a 1.WT event in 2019.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won the Classic Brugge-De Panne, sprinting to victory ahead of Chiara Consonni (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>A breakaway of two riders had been caught with one lap of the 42.9km finishing circuit to go. Cat Ferguson (Movistar) went solo with 35km to go and kept the peloton at just over ten seconds for a long time but was eventually reeled in 2.5km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek led the sprinters onto the finishing straight, but Wiebes launched her trademark sprint from Balsamo&#8217;s wheel with 200 metres to go and was a bike length ahead of Consonni and several bike lengths ahead of Balsamo on the line.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI started my sprint quite early,‚Äù said Wiebes after her first sixth victory of the 2025 season. ‚ÄúI had the feeling that I had to go. It was still quite far, also because it‚Äôs just a little bit uphill, but I could feel someone coming from behind, a shadow, so I thought, all-out to the line. In this finish, there‚Äôs always the danger of someone coming from behind with speed, but it was enough.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy with the teamwork.

This race has been part of the UCI Europe Tour in category 1.1 since 2005 and has been on the program of the French Road Cycling Cup since 1992 with the exception of 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>Luk√°≈° Kubi≈° (Unibet Tietema Rockets) secured the victory in a rain-soaked edition of the Cholet Agglo Tour, outsprinting his breakaway companions to take the win on the streets of Cholet. </p>\n<p>Kubi≈° was part of a three-rider breakaway that held off the peloton by a whisker when he launched his sprint inside 300 metres to go to take the win ahead of Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Niklas Larsen (BHS-PL Beton Bornholm).</p>\n<p>Cholet Agglo Tour offered the peloton a 205km race in and out of Cholet, as part of the Coupe de France.

With a distance of 298 kilometres (185 mi), it is the longest professional one-day race in modern road cycling in Europe. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907.It is traditionally the first of the five Monuments of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. It was the opening race of the UCI Road World Cup series until the series was replaced by the UCI ProTour in 2005 and the World Tour in 2011. Milan‚ÄìSan Remo is considered a sprinters classic because of its mainly flat course (although the Poggio climb close to the finish has often been an opportunity for puncheurs and rouleurs).</p>\n<p>After 289km of racing, the 116th edition of Milan-San Remo was decided by a three-way battle between Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), with the Dutchman emerging victorious in the sprint to the line on the Via Roma.</p>\n<p>The explosive finale kicked off on the slopes of the Cipressa, as Pogaƒçar‚Äôs squad launched the Slovenian‚Äôs inevitable attack with 25km to go. Ganna and Van der Poel were the only ones able to follow the searing acceleration as he attacked again. They then worked together to stay away until the foot of the Poggio when Pogaƒçar went again.</p>\n<p>The attack distanced Ganna, but it was not enough to shake Van der Poel, who held the wheel on Pogaƒçar‚Äôs preferred terrain. They were neck-and-neck as they began the twisting descent towards San Remo, with both riders knowing it would come down to a sprint.</p>\n<p>A brief lull in the pace towards the finish allowed Ganna to chase his way back on before the sprint, which Van der Poel led out from the front. An impressive kick meant that neither Pogaƒçar nor Ganna were able to come around him as he took his second victory at La Classicissima.</p>\n<p>Ganna held off Pogaƒçar for second place, with the World Champion having to settle for third place after all of his efforts. </p>\n<p>Michael Matthews (Jayco-AlUla) won the sprint behind for fourth place ahead of his compatriot Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), in yet another top-10 result for the Australian rider at the race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe,&#8221; Van der Poel said in a post-race interview. &#8220;I was focused on trying to get the win, but we knew that Tadej was going to be really strong. I felt really good at the end. The beginning was horrible with the rain and the cold, but when we came down to the coast I felt better and better. It is the third year in a row that we won with the team, and it is unique.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Poel said he was able to respond to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s attacks even though he felt that the World Champion was the strongest of the three on the final climbs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew Tadej was the strongest on the climbs. Already on the Cipressa, he was impressive, and then we went with three, the cooperation was pretty good. It was a podium spot. My finish was at the top of the Poggio, with Tadej, I knew he was going to try and drop me, but I felt strong. I hoped I could counter but he was strong enough to get me back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On his sprint on the run-in to the line, Van der Poel said, &#8220;I knew the other two wanted to make it a long sprint. They probably thought I would make it as short as possible, so I surprised them a bit when I saw the 300-metre sign, I launched my sprint and felt strong enough to keep it to the finish line.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nBeginning in cold and wet conditions at the start in Pavia, the peloton was a sea of black rain jackets and wet weather clothing as they rolled out for the neutral start. When the flag dropped for the official start of the race a few kilometres later, attacks to get into the breakaway began immediately, with the Italian wildcard teams particularly keen to get numbers up the road.</p>\n<p>A few attempts to go clear failed to materialise early on before a three-rider move comprising Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Tommaso Nencini (Team Solution Tech-Vini Fantini) and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) went up the road. They were then joined by a four-man group of Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Mark Stewart (Team Solution Tech-Vini Fantini), Baptiste Veistroffer (Lotto) and the youngest rider in the race Filippo Turconi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®), with Kristian Sbaragli (Team Solution Tech-Vini Fantini) bridging across solo to make it eight riders at the head of the race.</p>\n<p>Gone are the days when the peloton would allow the early breakaway upwards of ten minutes of an advantage at Milan-San Remo, as the gap to today‚Äôs escapees never went above six minutes. The man in charge of controlling that gap throughout the day was Silvan Dillier (Alpecin-Deceuninck), working for his teammates Mathieu van der Poel and last year‚Äôs winner Jasper Philipsen.</p>\n<p>The Swiss rider kept the breakaway‚Äôs advantage to around four minutes for the majority of the race, riding on the front of the peloton for more than 200km. All of the favourites‚Äô teams had riders positioned towards the front of the main group, but none wanted to commit riders to the chase, with Dillier content to do all of the work.</p>\n<p>As they reached the slopes of the Passo del Turchino with around 150km to go, the gap to the breakaway began to rapidly decrease, falling to under three minutes as the teams in the peloton looked to position themselves ahead of the climb and the descent that was to follow.</p>\n<p>After they summited the early climb and began the descent down the other side towards the Ligurian coast, the gap to those at the front began to re-establish itself, going back up to around four minutes. Dillier was still the one on the front of the peloton, keeping the breakaway in check at around four minutes of an advantage.</p>\n<p>The peloton then wound their way along the coast towards the Tre Capi climbs, with Dillier finally finishing his turn on the front of the group in the approach to the Capo Mele. Ineos Grenadiers then took up the pacing, with Geraint Thomas leading them through the towns that line the Italian seaside.</p>\n<p>The breakaway hit the Capo Mele at 53km to go, with Nencini the first to be dropped from the group. He was swallowed up by the peloton as the gap fell to around two minutes over the top of the climb.</p>\n<p>A small crash in the peloton with around 50km to go saw the likes of Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) and Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) hit the deck. A puncture for Jasper Philipsen also saw him fall to the back of the peloton, with all four riders able to make their way back onto the bunch.</p>\n<p>The Capo Cervo then followed before they reached the Capo Berta. The breakaway began to fracture at the front of the race with Marcellusi going solo over the top. Behind, we started to see the first riders dropped from the peloton on the steep gradients as UAE Team Emirates-XRG began to come to the fore to position Tadej Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Approaching the Cipressa, Marcellusi was the last of the breakaway to be caught with 27km to go, as a small crash between two riders saw many held up at the back of the peloton. Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) began to ramp up the pace as they began the penultimate climb of the race, dropping last year‚Äôs winner Philipsen from the peloton.</p>\n<p>The Belgian emptied the tank for his Slovenian leader on the lower slopes before Jhonathan Narv√°ez took up the pacing. As the Ecuadorian ended his pull, he did an all-out sprint to launch Pogaƒçar‚Äôs inevitable attack on the Cipressa. Many attempted to follow the World Champion‚Äôs acceleration, but only Filippo Ganna and Mathieu van der Poel were able to follow when he went again towards the top of the climb.</p>\n<p>The leading trio worked well together on the descent as they began the run toward the Poggio, exchanging turns to maintain their advantage over the bunch behind. They reached the foot of the final climb with a gap of around 45 seconds as Pogaƒçar accelerated again through the first hairpin.</p>\n<p>Ganna was distanced instantly, unable to match the immediate acceleration of the other two, whilst Van der Poel stayed glued to the wheel of the World Champion as he tried to drop him again and again through each of the turns, but he could not open up a sizeable gap.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel then tried his own attack with 500m to go until the summit and whilst he was able to briefly distance his rival, it was not enough to snap the elastic and both riders accepted that the race would ultimately be decided in a sprint on the Via Roma.</p>\n<p>The twisting downhill towards San Remo saw Ganna claw back some ground on the two at the front, who seemed slightly less willing to fully commit on the descent, and the Italian now had them in his sights as they began the run-in to the finish.</p>\n<p>He made the junction with around one kilometre to go, making it a three-way fight for the victory as they entered the final few hundred metres on the Via Roma. Pogaƒçar forced Van der Poel to the front as he slotted in at the back of the group behind the returning Ganna.</p>\n<p>Unwilling to wait for the other two to make their moves, Van der Poel launched his sprint from the front, catching Ganna somewhat off-guard and using his kick to instantly open up a small gap. The Italian was unable to match the Dutchman‚Äôs acceleration, whilst Pogaƒçar was simply outgunned.  </p>\n<p>With neither of them able to come around him, Van der Poel took an emphatic victory and claimed the sixth Monument title of his career, winning Milan-San Remo for the second time in three years.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour. The equivalent men&#8217;s race is a cycling monument, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. The race is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, over a shorter distance but with an identical finish in Sanremo.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won the 2025 Milan-San Remo Women, crossing the line first in the sprint of a small group ahead of Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), with Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) finishing third.</p>\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Pr√®vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) initially finished fourth on the day but was later relegated to 12th place.</p>\n<p>After a hectic descent from the Poggio, Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) attacked right away and got a sizeable gap at first until Wiebes&#8217; teammate, world champion Lotte Kopecky went all-out in the chase.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini was a few seconds ahead at the flamme rouge, and Vos was first to launch her sprint, prompting Wiebes to react. As they passed Longo Borghini, Vos took the lead, but Wiebes had a last punch left, passing Vos in the final ten metres to win.</p>\n<p>Asked if her victory had sunk in yet, Wiebes said in a post-race interview, &#8220;Not yet I think but I had to finish the teamwork off. I&#8217;m really grateful for the team how we worked as a team and what Lotte did in the final I&#8217;m super grateful for.</p>\n<p>Wiebes said she felt good on the Cipressa, among the reduced group, and was able to stay with the top riders over the Poggio, too, and that is when she knew she could contest the final. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there were multiple options but I felt that I did good on the Cipressa so also on the Poggio, I was with the first five or something at the top and then I knew I would ride for the win. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Longo Borghini did a really strong attack but I saw Lotte was close behind and, as I said, the effort she made was amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wiebes also said she was not worried about the descent or the final kilometre where Longo Borghini made a surprise attack, knowing Kopecky was there to bring the Italian back into the fold in the final metres. </p>\n<p>&#8220;No. I knew how strong Lotte is and she put me in the perfect position. I need to say Vos surprised me a little bit. I didn&#8217;t want to open my sprint too early but it was enough for the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in Genoa, the 156-kilometre women‚Äôs race took place almost exclusively on the Via Aurelia, the Ligurian coastal road, with the climbs of the Cipressa and Poggio being the only exceptions.</p>\n<p>Early attacks from Anne Knijnenburg (VolkerWessels) and Nikola Noskov√° (Cofidis) were quickly reeled in again, and it was only when Knijnenburg attacked again after more than 60km that a breakaway was established.</p>\n<p>Laura Tomasi (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) and Virginia Bortoli (Top Girls Fassa Bortolo) formed a chase duo, and with 68km to go, they were a minute and 20 seconds behind Knijnenburg, with the peloton at 2:30 minutes.</p>\n<p>A crash 54km from the line briefly held up Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), among others, but she easily returned to the peloton. Soon after, Tomasi and Bortoli were caught while Knijnenburg made it over the Capo Mele solo, only being reeled in after the descent, just inside the 50-kilometre mark.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike, Fenix-Deceunick, and FDJ-Suez set a high pace on the Capo Cervo and Capo Berta, reducing the peloton, but none of the favourites were in difficulty yet. A crash near the front of the pack with 30.5km to go took down a.o. Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Kopecky and held up Wiebes, temporarily fracturing the peloton in the run-in to the Cipressa.</p>\n<p>After a hectic chase, most crashed riders returned to the front ahead of the Cipressa, and about sixty riders started the longest climb of the day together. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) and Loes Adegeest (FDJ-Suez) set a hard pace on the first half of the 5.6km climb. When they swung off, Lidl-Trek took control, reducing the speed to protect Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot went into the descent first and stretched out the peloton, leading to a group of 13 riders having a gap at the bottom that included Longo Borghini, Kopecky, Wiebes, Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Demi Vollering, Juliette Labous (both FDJ-Suez), Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Balsamo, Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco). Only Vas and Kopecky wanted to keep the group going, though, and things came back together with 15km to go.</p>\n<p>Following another fast run-in, 21 riders entered the Poggio together. Vas briefly set the pace, then Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) came to the front and went to work with her team‚Äôs leader Niewiadoma slotting in behind her.</p>\n<p>Labous made her move about a kilometre from the top, prompting counterattacks by Niewiadoma and Le Court, but none of them could shake off the rest of the favourites. When Vollering attacked just before the top, it was more to get a good position for the descent than anything else.</p>\n<p>Vollering led the race down most of the descent with riders in single file behind her. Pieterse took over on the last bit, and when they had reached the bottom of the descent, Longo Borghini immediately launched her all-or-nothing attack. The Italian champion quickly gained a gap, but Kopecky went to the front of the 12-rider chase group almost as quickly and started to chase in service of her teammate Wiebes.</p>\n<p>After the 250-metre mark, with Kopecky still about ten metres behind Longo Borghini, Vos launched her sprint from sixth position, anticipating Wiebes. Because of the head start, Vos took the lead, but Wiebes was still winding up her sprint and came past on the last metres to take the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event was first run in 1876 making it the oldest classic race in the world. The race is ranked UCI ProSeries on the UCI continental calendar.</p>\n<p>Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) took the victory in Milano-Torino, the oldest Classic on the calendar, outpowering Ben Tulett (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) in a three-up sprint on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Johannessen led out the finale, attacking first in the final kilometre, but Tulett quickly reeled him back in. Del Toro waited patiently in the Brit&#8217;s wheel, before launching away in the final 200 metres to celebrate with a bow at the line.</p>\n<p>With the return of the iconic climb to the Basilica de Superga deciding the day, the top riders battled it out over two reps of the stinging ascent, with Del Toro benefiting from great work done by Adam Yates and the rest of UAE&#8217;s squad throughout the final 25km.</p>\n<p>This was the 21-year-old Mexican&#8217;s first victory in 2025, after bursting onto the scene during his neo-pro season last year. It also continues a stunning start to the campaign for UAE, with this victory their 19th already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I deserve it, I am super happy about it. The team works really a lot for this and I realised my first victory this year and I really enjoyed this race,&#8221; said Del Toro after his victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe I made it.

The event was first run in 1876 making it the oldest classic race in the world. The race is ranked UCI ProSeries on the UCI continental calendar.</p>\n<p>Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) took the victory in Milano-Torino, the oldest Classic on the calendar, outpowering Ben Tulett (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) in a three-up sprint on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Johannessen led out the finale, attacking first in the final kilometre, but Tulett quickly reeled him back in. Del Toro waited patiently in the Brit&#8217;s wheel, before launching away in the final 200 metres to celebrate with a bow at the line.</p>\n<p>With the return of the iconic climb to the Basilica de Superga deciding the day, the top riders battled it out over two reps of the stinging ascent, with Del Toro benefiting from great work done by Adam Yates and the rest of UAE&#8217;s squad throughout the final 25km.</p>\n<p>This was the 21-year-old Mexican&#8217;s first victory in 2025, after bursting onto the scene during his neo-pro season last year. It also continues a stunning start to the campaign for UAE, with this victory their 19th already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I deserve it, I am super happy about it.

A move wouldn‚Äôt go clear before that point, however, at which point Lennert Teugels (Tartoletto-Isorex) and Rasmus B√∏gh Wallin (Uno-X Mobility) jumped clear at the front.</p>\n<p>The pair were quickly joined by another pair of riders in Jelle Johannik (Unibet Tietema Rockets) and Alex Colman (Flanders-Baloise), making it a four-man break of the day.</p>\n<p>The quartet would race to a maximum advantage of two minutes in the early stages of the race as teams including Alpecin-Deceuninck, UAE Team Emirates-XRG, and Tudor settled in to work at the head of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Those behind in the peloton hoping to keep things on track for a mass sprint finish would keep the break on a tight leash, holding the four leaders to an advantage of 1:30 or less as the riders raced onto the closing circuits around Nokere.</p>\n<p>Once the break hit the Nokereberg for the first time, with just under 100km to go, the four men were holding on with a reduced 50-second gap. A brief split in the peloton and a short-lived move led by Gianni Vermeersch (Alpecin-Deceuninck) at 80km to go didn‚Äôt change much in the overall picture, however.</p>\n<p>At 52km from the finish, the break was reduced to three men when Colman dropped away on the Lange Ast hill. He was brought back to the peloton 10km later, just before the third ascent of the Nokereberg.</p>\n<p>On the way up, there was another split at the head of the peloton, with Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) going clear along with Arthur Kluckers (Tudor) and Luk√°≈° Kubi≈° (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>Further back, a second group of attackers formed, with Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ) joined by Florian Vermeersch (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Jakob S√∂derqvist (Lidl-Trek), Edward Planckaert (Alpecin-Deceuninck), and Erik Resell (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>As Johannik led the break over the top once again, securing the day‚Äôs mountain classification prize, the two chase groups soon coalesced into one large chase group, 40 seconds down on the break and 20 up on the peloton, which was led into the long closing 38km lap by Lotto.</p>\n<p>The merged group was soon back with the peloton, however, getting reabsorbed ‚Äì along with Teugels, the next man dropped from the break ‚Äì at 33km to go.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck regained control of the peloton thereafter, while the break continued with a reduced 30-second advantage.

It‚Äôs for all of us today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a long sprint, because the final climb was hurting already, but one last kilometre was really long, and then I was only hearing in my ear ‚Äògo, go, go for it!‚Äô and then I just kept pushing, then I saw the line and I‚Äôm first. I was like ‚Äòoh my god, I can‚Äôt believe it!'&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe hilly, cobbled race got off to a fast start on Wednesday morning, with the high pace and technical laps meaning that no early break went, and things were still all together after 50km of racing.</p>\n<p>After 70km, a rider did finally get away when Sweden‚Äôs Stina Kagevi (Team Coop-Repsol) broke off the front of the peloton. The previously very controlled bunch clearly weren‚Äôt too worried about one solo attacker, as they let Kagevi quickly build a lead of a minute as things settled slightly.</p>\n<p>The calm didn‚Äôt last long, however, with the final 50km ushering in more action as several teams pushed the pace of the Lange Ast climb, which started to whittle down the bunch. On the flat, it was various individual riders who were injecting some aggression into the race, with sporadic attacks rather than a concerted effort from any one team.</p>\n<p>The left Kagevi hanging out front for quite some time, but heading towards the final 30km the pace really lifted and started eating into the Swedish rider‚Äôs lead. SD Worx-Protime, Lidl-Trek and FDJ-SUEZ were consistently trying to force a move off the front of the peloton, but it was tough to break the elastic with some really dangerous riders getting involved in the action.</p>\n<p>Kagevi was looking remarkably strong up front, not letting herself sit up even when the peloton was close, and pulled her lead back out again when the bunch settled, but she was finally caught with 20km to go.</p>\n<p>With a tough finale awaiting, there was some hesitance to just ride towards a sprint finish so the attacks continued, but still no one could quite make anything stick on the tarmac.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility‚Äôs Aniina Ahtosalo was a key protagonist, always instigating attacks and leading the bunch across the cobbled sectors. With 11km to go, Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Anna Henderson attacked on a cobbled sector to open up a dangerous gap, but she was brought back with 7km to go as Visma-Lease a Bike led the chase.</p>\n<p>Three riders tried to go on the counter-attack after the catch, but everything was together with 4km to go as it looked like a large uphill sprint was coming in Nokere.</p>\n<p>Fenix-Deceuninck and Uno-X Mobility had the most organised lead-outs heading into the final, and the Norwegians looked to have got it perfectly with Zanetti leading into the final 50 metres. However, one last acceleration from Lach proved too much as the SD Worx rider sealed victory, extending the team‚Äôs Nokere Koerse winning streak to five.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10430&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10430&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 2007, it is raced annually on the first or second Saturday of March. The name stems from the historic white gravel roads in the Crete Senesi, which are a defining feature of the race. One-third of the total race distance is raced on dirt roads, covering 63 km (39 mi) of strade bianche, spread over 11 sectors. Despite its short history, the Strade Bianche has quickly gained prestige, and renewed interest in road racing on gravel and dirt roads as a specific skill and discipline. The event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional road races.</p>\n<p>A bloodied and bruised Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) soared to a stunning third title at Strade Bianche, recovering from a high-speed crash before dropping Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) 19km from the line and riding solo to the Piazza del Campo in Siena.</p>\n<p>In a dramatic incident, Pogaƒçar slid out of a corner and crashed heavily with 50 kilometres remaining.

Now the adrenaline has worn off, I&#8217;m starting to feel a lot of pain, so it&#8217;s not the best way to win a race,&#8221; said Pogaƒçar post-race. &#8220;But a win is a win, and let&#8217;s hope it&#8217;s nothing worse than it looks and all should be fine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went too fast, I guess,&#8221; he said, explaining the crash, &#8220;I know this race very well, I&#8217;ve ridden it like 20 times already now in my life, but sometimes you misjudge and I don&#8217;t know, I just slipped and shit happens.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For a moment, I didn&#8217;t know if I was OK, and the bike was not working, so I had to change it. I was a bit worried because when you crash, the body takes a lot from you. But I still had enough to finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nGreat weather in Siena welcomed the 174 riders at the start of the men&#8217;s race, with one non-starter in Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious) due to illness. There was a more difficult 213km route to contend with and 16 sectors, 82km of white gravel roads on the menu in Tuscany.</p>\n<p>Quickly, a breakaway was established on the first sector, Vidritta, with a strong 10-rider group getting up the road, Johan Price-Pejtersen (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Stan Dewulf (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Simone Petilli (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Albert Withen Philipsen (Lidl-Trek), Mark Donovan (Q36.5), Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-QuickStep), Anders Foldager (Jayco AlUla) and Fabian Weiss (Tudor).</p>\n<p>The gap went out to five minutes as the crashes began to come thick and fast for the likes of David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and Diego Ulissi (XDS-Astana). The gravel roads may have looked idyllic, but they were already taking victims.</p>\n<p>With UAE Team Emirates-XRG beginning to ramp things up behind for Pogaƒçar, those in the breakaway sensed the danger and started to attack each other. Donovan and Reinderink sparked an acceleration which reduced it down to just six riders in front with 121km to go, with Askey, Swift, Foldager and Weiss also following.</p>\n<p>With the crucial Monte Sante Marie sector approaching, where Pogaƒçar launched his explosive 81km solo attack last year, Florian Vermeersch, Tim Wellens and Isaac del Toro positioned the rainbow bands, preparing for blast-off.</p>\n<p>Pidcock moved onto the wheel of Wellens and moved first when the Belgian was finished doing his pull, with Pogaƒçar snapping alongside him and trying to launch a counter.</p>\n<p>The Olympic MTB champion was able to follow the Slovenian&#8217;s powerful surge, and on the downhill roads of the Monte Sante Marie, a lead trio formed as former British national gravel champ Swift got back to the star duo after being dropped by them on the climb.</p>\n<p>Racing calmed in the middle phase after the gaps had been made, with several small chase groups working away at the deficit over one minute down on the lead trio.</p>\n<p>However, the race suddenly exploded into life with 49km remaining when Pogaƒçar crashed at high speed, sliding out of a gravel corner and rolling off the road into the grass. His left shoulder, elbow, knee and shin were cut, and his world champion&#8217;s kit shredded, but with the adrenaline pumping, Pogaƒçar was quickly back onto his bike and chasing.</p>\n<p>Swift&#8217;s race came undone after following Pogaƒçar into the ditch, albeit without crashing, and he was left behind as the world champion worked to get back to Pidcock. The Q36.5 rider actually slowed down and waited for his rival ahead of the key gravel sectors.</p>\n<p>Needing some time to recover, Pogaƒçar and Pidcock&#8217;s duel for victory didn&#8217;t begin on the first lap over the Colle Pinzuto and Le Tolfe gravel climbs but instead came inside the final 20km.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar took over the front position ahead of the Colle Pinzuto and started to put the power down in the saddle. Pidcock tried to respond, but the gap grew from one metre to five metres and soon 20 metres quickly on the gravel.</p>\n<p>With the gap exploding past the one-minute mark, Pidcock settled into his own rhythm and began to accept that second place was the best result he could score today. He would survive a late chase from Wellens, who attacked out of the leading chase group to take third in Siena.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar kept the pressure on as he rode for his third title in Tuscany, despite his visible injuries, and he was able to celebrate after completing his way up the Via Santa Catarina. With his third title, he also becomes the first rider to win Strade Bianche and the first men&#8217;s world champion to win the Italian one-day Classic.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=54&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=54&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Roughly a quarter of the route is raced on white gravel roads ‚Äì unpaved country lanes winding through the countryside of the Chianti region ‚Äì from which the event gets its name. First held in 2015, the race is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier female elite competition. It is organized on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, on the first or second Saturday of March, on much of the same roads but at a shorter distance.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) won the Strade Bianche Women ahead of Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), becoming the third woman to win the race twice.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen had attacked into the final gravel sector, Le Tolfe, and was caught by Vollering, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), and Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) on the steep gravel climb.</p>\n<p>Vollering then made her move over the top, but Van der Breggen jumped onto her wheel immediately. On the run-in to Siena, they worked together to increase their advantage to 1:45 minutes at the flamme rouge.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen led the duo onto the Via Santa Caterina climb, but with 500 metres to go, Vollering launched a fierce attack to drop her former teammate and coach and win on the Piazza del Campo.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot was the strongest rider of the chase group, distancing the others on the final kilometre to take third place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I was good before the race, and everyone expected it from me, but then to do it is another thing. You have so much pressure and really want to finish it off, not only for yourself but for your teammates, family, and friends. To finish it off here like I did today, thanks to the work from all my teammates, I am super happy and proud,&#8221; said Vollering at the finish line.</p>\n<p>The 28-year-old‚Äôs first victory in Siena came in a sprint against her then-teammate Lotte Kopecky. This time, she beat her former teammate, coach and mentor, Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs fun to race against Anna, it feels like when I started, so it‚Äôs also a reminder for myself how much I have grown over the years,&#8221; said Vollering, who didn&#8217;t panic despite a strong front group of seven riders including Ferrand-Pr√©vot having a sizeable gap coming into the final 23km.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was a bit like, &#8216;is it going to be the same as Nieuwsblad again&#8217;, but then Juliette [Labous] did a really strong lead-out on the gravel section [Colle Pinzuto] and I tried to attack there already, but my chain dropped, so that was a cross through that plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kept calm. Juliette was there and did a really strong lead-out again, and then I went again, full-gas. Anna did very smart by going already in the downhill, and she could stay with me, and I was hoping she worked with me because also for her it‚Äôs a nice opportunity. I‚Äôm grateful that it worked out.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was no early breakaway as the peloton tackled the 50.3km of gravel distributed over 13 sectors interspersed with stretches of asphalt for a total race distance of 136 kilometres.</p>\n<p>Vollering suffered a puncture on the longest gravel sector, San Martino in Grania, but easily made it back to the peloton, which had been reduced to some 50 riders. An attack by Eva van Agt (Visma-Lease a Bike) led to a breakaway of seven that was caught on the Monteaperti sector. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and her teammate, Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka, crashed on the descent that followed and had to abandon the race.</p>\n<p>Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) attacked on the first passage of the Colle Pinzuto sector and kept a small gap on a chase group of six that was caught as they entered the Le Tolfe sector for the first time. Liane Lippert (Movistar Team) then brought the peloton of 19 riders back to Gerritse at the end of Le Tolfe, 42km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) initiated an attack on the plateau, taking Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), and Gerritse with her. Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), and Marte Berg Edseth (Uno-X Mobility) bridged across to this quartet to form a front group of seven.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot slid out in a downhill corner but was quickly back on her bike, and the group built an advantage of up to 1:25 minutes at the end of the Montechiaro sector. This was when Labous took up the chase in earnest, steadily reducing the gap to 30 seconds as they entered the Colle Pinzuto.</p>\n<p>Gerritse could not follow the frontrunners anymore, and when Vollering made her move, only Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) and Labous could follow. But Vollering‚Äôs mechanical enabled Van der Breggen, Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly), and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) to catch back up.</p>\n<p>Labous went to the front of the group again to chase, and when the two groups merged with 16km to go, Muzic took responsibility for the pace. Van der Breggen positioned herself well to be first into the final gravel sector, Le Tolfe, opening a gap on the first descending half.</p>\n<p>On the climb, Vollering, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, and Labous bridged to Van der Breggen, and Vollering kept going over the top to open a gap. Only Van der Breggen managed to jump after her and get back into Vollering‚Äôs wheel.</p>\n<p>Although more riders came back to Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Labous, the front duo was in charge and steadily increased their advantage, making it clear that the victory would be decided between Vollering and Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p>On the last kilometre, Van der Breggen set the pace on the lower slopes of the Via Santa Caterina climb, but Vollering left her former coach behind with a final attack to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9044&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9044&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Roughly a quarter of the route is raced on white gravel roads ‚Äì unpaved country lanes winding through the countryside of the Chianti region ‚Äì from which the event gets its name. First held in 2015, the race is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier female elite competition. It is organized on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, on the first or second Saturday of March, on much of the same roads but at a shorter distance.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) won the Strade Bianche Women ahead of Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), becoming the third woman to win the race twice.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen had attacked into the final gravel sector, Le Tolfe, and was caught by Vollering, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), and Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) on the steep gravel climb.</p>\n<p>Vollering then made her move over the top, but Van der Breggen jumped onto her wheel immediately. On the run-in to Siena, they worked together to increase their advantage to 1:45 minutes at the flamme rouge.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen led the duo onto the Via Santa Caterina climb, but with 500 metres to go, Vollering launched a fierce attack to drop her former teammate and coach and win on the Piazza del Campo.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot was the strongest rider of the chase group, distancing the others on the final kilometre to take third place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I was good before the race, and everyone expected it from me, but then to do it is another thing. You have so much pressure and really want to finish it off, not only for yourself but for your teammates, family, and friends. To finish it off here like I did today, thanks to the work from all my teammates, I am super happy and proud,&#8221; said Vollering at the finish line.</p>\n<p>The 28-year-old‚Äôs first victory in Siena came in a sprint against her then-teammate Lotte Kopecky. This time, she beat her former teammate, coach and mentor, Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs fun to race against Anna, it feels like when I started, so it‚Äôs also a reminder for myself how much I have grown over the years,&#8221; said Vollering, who didn&#8217;t panic despite a strong front group of seven riders including Ferrand-Pr√©vot having a sizeable gap coming into the final 23km.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was a bit like, &#8216;is it going to be the same as Nieuwsblad again&#8217;, but then Juliette [Labous] did a really strong lead-out on the gravel section [Colle Pinzuto] and I tried to attack there already, but my chain dropped, so that was a cross through that plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kept calm. Juliette was there and did a really strong lead-out again, and then I went again, full-gas. Anna did very smart by going already in the downhill, and she could stay with me, and I was hoping she worked with me because also for her it‚Äôs a nice opportunity. I‚Äôm grateful that it worked out.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was no early breakaway as the peloton tackled the 50.3km of gravel distributed over 13 sectors interspersed with stretches of asphalt for a total race distance of 136 kilometres.</p>\n<p>Vollering suffered a puncture on the longest gravel sector, San Martino in Grania, but easily made it back to the peloton, which had been reduced to some 50 riders. An attack by Eva van Agt (Visma-Lease a Bike) led to a breakaway of seven that was caught on the Monteaperti sector. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and her teammate, Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka, crashed on the descent that followed and had to abandon the race.</p>\n<p>Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) attacked on the first passage of the Colle Pinzuto sector and kept a small gap on a chase group of six that was caught as they entered the Le Tolfe sector for the first time. Liane Lippert (Movistar Team) then brought the peloton of 19 riders back to Gerritse at the end of Le Tolfe, 42km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) initiated an attack on the plateau, taking Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), and Gerritse with her. Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), and Marte Berg Edseth (Uno-X Mobility) bridged across to this quartet to form a front group of seven.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot slid out in a downhill corner but was quickly back on her bike, and the group built an advantage of up to 1:25 minutes at the end of the Montechiaro sector. This was when Labous took up the chase in earnest, steadily reducing the gap to 30 seconds as they entered the Colle Pinzuto.</p>\n<p>Gerritse could not follow the frontrunners anymore, and when Vollering made her move, only Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) and Labous could follow. But Vollering‚Äôs mechanical enabled Van der Breggen, Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly), and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) to catch back up.</p>\n<p>Labous went to the front of the group again to chase, and when the two groups merged with 16km to go, Muzic took responsibility for the pace. Van der Breggen positioned herself well to be first into the final gravel sector, Le Tolfe, opening a gap on the first descending half.</p>\n<p>On the climb, Vollering, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, and Labous bridged to Van der Breggen, and Vollering kept going over the top to open a gap. Only Van der Breggen managed to jump after her and get back into Vollering‚Äôs wheel.</p>\n<p>Although more riders came back to Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Labous, the front duo was in charge and steadily increased their advantage, making it clear that the victory would be decided between Vollering and Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p>On the last kilometre, Van der Breggen set the pace on the lower slopes of the Via Santa Caterina climb, but Vollering left her former coach behind with a final attack to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9044&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9044&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route included numerous cobbled sectors and nine hills, all located on the three-and-a-half closing laps around Dour.</p>\n<p>A breakaway would take a little while to go amid battles to make the move at the start of the race. The move went almost 30km out from the start with seven riders filling the group.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Grindley (Lidl-Trek) was joined in the breakaway by Gotzon Mart√≠n (Euskaltel-Euskadi), Joren Bloem (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Lo√Øc Vliegen (Wagner Bazin WB), Silas K√∂ch (Lotto-Kern Haus-PSD Bank), Hidde Van Veenendaal (Beat Cycling Club), Stijn Daemen (VolkerWessels), and Guillaume Visser (Diftar).</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, the biggest teams in the peloton ‚Äì including Mathieu van der Poel‚Äôs Alpecin-Deceuninck ‚Äì took control at the front as they let the break get three minutes up the road.</p>\n<p>At the midway mark, the break was 2:45 up the road and it would be a while before any major moves were made at the front. With 87km to go, the riders passed the finish line for the first time to get the closing laps underway, the break‚Äôs advantage still holding firm.</p>\n<p>The situation wouldn‚Äôt remain the same for too much longer, however, as attacks started to go at the front of the peloton, led by Alpecin-Deceuninck at the 65km mark. Timo Kielich and Mathieu van der Poel were the riders in question, putting in a pair of testing moves as the peloton got within a minute of the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) was another notable name to try an attack, with both he and Van der Poel trying again with 50km to go. By that point, the breakaway had been hauled in, and there were moves going minute by minute at the front.</p>\n<p>Racing into the final 40km, another group went clear. Van der Hoorn was in there, with the Dutchman joined in the attack by Lewis Bower (Groupama-FDJ), Samuel Gaze (Alpecin-Deceuninck), and Martin Svrƒçek (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>Cedric Beullens (Lotto), Thomas Gachinard (TotalEnergies), Axel Huens (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Noah Vandenbranden (Flanders-Baloise), and Killian Th√©ot (Van Rysel-Roubaix) also went along for the ride to fill out the nine-rider attacking group.</p>\n<p>The new break got 15 seconds up the road before Uno-X Mobility took up the work back in the peloton to try and keep the situation under control. They saw Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels and Lidl-Trek join in the pacemaking, holding the gap to 10 seconds as the race closed in on the final 20km.</p>\n<p>With 19km to go, and the break still to be caught, misfortune struck Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), who was forced to stop for a bike change with very unlucky timing. As the Belgian champion attempted to chase back on, the peloton closed to within a handful of seconds of the leaders, eventually bringing them back 15km from the line.</p>\n<p>De Lie was back on before the closing 10km and in the mix at the front of the peloton, while right on the front it was Kielich who led Van der Poel towards the final kilometres of the race.</p>\n<p>Luca Van Boven (Intermarch√©-Wanty) made a move at 7km to go, drawing out Kielich and Alec Segaerts (Lotto) in the process. The move was done and dusted at 4 to go, however, setting up a grand finale on the charge back to Dour.</p>\n<p>Florian S√©n√®chal (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) made an effort on the day‚Äôs final cobbled sector at 2km out, though it was all together at the front heading to the uphill ramp of the finish.</p>\n<p>There was no properly organised lead-out train on the short run to the line, though Astana looked the most organised in the final kilometre with two up front.

Various attacks went off the front of the peloton as the race left the start but it took an extremely long time for the breakaway to form.

They had a maximum gap of over four and a half minutes on the peloton.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final 100km Omloop Het Nieuwsblad winner S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) was dropped from the bunch, while there was an attack by Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ) and Thimo Kielich (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>The latter had a front wheel puncture which saw him drop out of the attacking group and to the back of the peloton. Behind this new move there was wave after wave of attacks, mainly led by Visma-Lease a Bike‚Äôs Matteo Jorgenson and Tiesj Benoot, but Lidl-Trek kept a stranglehold on the race with Jonathan Milan a big favourite at the start of the day.</p>\n<p>On the hardest climb of the race, the cobbled Mont Saint Laurent, there were more attacks with Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) and Stan Dewulf getting clear and bridging to Askey, who was dropped by Narv√°ez.</p>\n<p>This group swelled with 16 riders getting away from the main peloton with 80km to go, and Narv√°ez dropping back into the group too. Just 5km later the new attacking group was dragged back under control by the sprinters&#8217; teams, but the likes of Wellens kept on trying to force a break.</p>\n<p>On the final cobbled climb, the Oude Kruisberg, Jorgenson and Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) tried once again: Van Aert put in a very long acceleration on the front but he wasn‚Äôt able to split the group.</p>\n<p>Stefan Bissegger (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) went off the front of the pack on his own and put in a great effort pushing across to the break. Behind him, Wellens kicked again and made his way across to Bissegger before he got to the break.</p>\n<p>In the peloton the pace dropped dramatically as the favourites blocked any attacks on the C√¥te du Trieu before kicking hard over the top, stretching the bunch out into one long line and two big groups, but Soudal-QuickStep dragged it all back together.</p>\n<p>On the final climb of the day, the Kluisberg, with 60km to go, Van Aert attacked hard with only Roger Adri√† (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) able to follow the superstar. But with Adri√† not working, Van Aert decided that he wouldn&#8217;t drag the Spaniard to the finish and sat up to rejoin the Soudal-QuickStep-led peloton.</p>\n<p>After the duo were brought back it was the sprinters&#8217; teams that took over in the peloton, keeping the pace high as they tried to control the gap to the break and dragging them back. An attack in the break by De Bondt with just under 40km to go managed to do nothing but drop his teammate, Bissegger, as well as Van Petegem with them both quickly getting caught by the peloton.</p>\n<p>The remaining seven riders in the break continued to attack each other with Wellens going solo on the final cobbled sector of the Beerbosstraat with De Bondt, Mayrhofer and Desal able to follow him.</p>\n<p>The four riders who kicked clear got their gap up to 42‚Äù again but the sprinters&#8217; teams in the peloton got everything under control and the leaders had just 15‚Äù heading into the final 20km.</p>\n<p>As they crossed the circuit&#8217;s finish line for the penultimate time the breakaway tried one more time to get away, with Mayrhofer the last man clear before the break was caught, with just over 10km to go.</p>\n<p>The pace continued to ratchet up as the kilometres ticked down through the technical lap around Kuurne, with Alpecin-Deceuninck waiting until the final 2km to bring Philipsen towards the front.

Over three minutes behind, Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) beat Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) in the sprint for third, just ahead of what remained of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Claes and Nerlo had been part of a break of five that went away in the first ten kilometres. Julie Stockman (DD Group) was dropped from the break, but Claes, Nerlo, Elena Pirrone (Roland) and Mieke Docx were still more than 13 minutes ahead with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>Although the big teams took up the chase eventually, the four riders started the Muur van Geraardsbergen with six minutes in hand. Claes and Nerlo left Pirrone and Docx behind on the cobbled climb, cresting the top 4:37 minutes ahead of Vollering and Pieterse, who had attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Still four minutes ahead atop the Bosberg, it was clear that Claes and Nerlo would fight for the victory. Claes tried an attack out of the left turn in Denderwindeke with 4.5km to go, but Nerlo could hold her wheel.</p>\n<p>The Polish rider then made her own acceleration just before the flamme rouge and had Claes gapped, but the 31-year-old Belgian made her way back with 250 meters to go and then launched her sprint to win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs really unbelievable. It‚Äôs only my second pro year. Before that, I combined it with working in a hospital as a nurse. So I hope it‚Äôs a step towards a bright future,&#8221; said Claes after taking her first pro victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were here with ambitions, but since the race usually ends in a sprint, my role was to help our sprinters. But I am very happy that they gave us such a big advantage. After the Berendries, I thought, &#8216;OK, we have to stay together and work together well until the Muur, and from then on, just set a high pace and make a time trial of it.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt have fast legs, but after a hard race, I often have something left. The other girl started quite early, which was to her advantage because she is a bit more explosive. She can get going really quickly. I don‚Äôt have that explosiveness, and I was hurting everywhere. But then she couldn‚Äôt keep it up, and I managed to get back with one big push.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe break of the day ‚Äì and, as it turned out, the winning break ‚Äì had formed very early in the 137.9km race. Valerie Demey (VolkerWessels) and Andrea Casagranda (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni) went on the chase and were eventually joined by Casagranda‚Äôs teammate Beatrice Caudera as well as Giulia Giuliani (Roland).</p>\n<p>Halfway through the race, Casagranda had been dropped from the chase group while the other three riders were over four minutes down on Pirrone, Claes, Nerlo, Stockman, and Docx. The peloton was more than nine minutes behind at that point.</p>\n<p>With nobody taking responsibility for the chase, the gap ballooned even further, and when the live broadcast began on the cobbles of the Haaghoek with 38km to go, the breakaway of Claes, Nerlo, Pirrone, and Docx was still almost 11 minutes in front.</p>\n<p>FDJ-Suez eventually took up the gauntlet and slotted into position at the front of the peloton, with AG Insurance-Soudal, Fenix-Deceuninck, SD Worx-Protime, EF Education-Oatly, and Lidl-Trek also joining in. They caught the chasers and reduced the gap to about six minutes as they entered Geraardsbergen.</p>\n<p>Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) set a high pace on the Vesten and handed over to Vollering on the steepest part of the Muur. Only Pieterse could follow the Dutchwoman‚Äôs acceleration, with other riders following in ones and twos. At the top of the iconic climb, though, Vollering and Pieterse were still 4:37 minutes down on Claes and Nerlo.</p>\n<p>Although they caught and dropped Pirrone and Docx in the final, the victory was decided between Claes and Nerlo, with a happy ending for the Belgian. Vollering outsprinted Pieterse for third place, 3:25 minutes behind, with Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) leading home the peloton ten seconds later.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9181&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9181&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2017, the race is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier professional events.</p>\n<p>The Omloop Het Nieuwsblad provided its usual fantastically bonkers start to the Classics seasons with attacks, tactical headaches, crashes and cobbles, but after all that it came down to a bunch sprint with S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) taking a surprise win ahead of Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep) and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck). </p>\n<p>Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) looked as though he had stolen a march when he attacked away from the peloton after the Bosberg and was allowed to build a gap of over 15 seconds. However, as more teams came back after the key cobbled climbs were completed and he battled with a strong headwind in the run for home, he was eventually pulled back inside the final kilometre. </p>\n<p>When the sprint opened up in Ninove, it was Ineos Grenadiers who were best positioned coming into the final bend. Philipsen hit the front, launching away from a fading Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), but W√¶renskjold and Magnier came with a lot of speed on either side of the Belgian and beat him.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian was unsure of the result as he crossed the line with a desperate bike throw, however, the photo finish revealed that he had a bigger winning gap than he realised. He celebrated with his teammates once he was informed over the radio of the biggest victory of his career so far. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in the Belgian city of Gent, the 80th men‚Äôs Omloop Het Nieuwsblad set off on a 197km route, taking on eleven cobbled sectors as the riders headed to the finish in Ninove. </p>\n<p>The racing kicked off with the usual plethora of attacks. Six riders got an early gap with one chaser, eventually forming a seven-man group. </p>\n<p>They were Elmar Reinders (Jayco-AlUla), Julius van den Berg (Picnic-PostNL), Victor Vercouillie (Flanders-Baloise), Hartthijs De Vries (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Enzo Leijnse (Picnic-PostNL), Giosu√® Epis (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Siebe Deweirdt (Flander-Baloise). Getting a maximum gap of 7:40 on the peloton. </p>\n<p>There were multiple reports of early crashes but nothing to say that anyone was injured or abandoning the race as the riders took on the first cobbled sections of the Classics season. </p>\n<p>With 92km to go on the third cobbled sector, the Lange Munte, UAE Team Emirates-XRG attacked the peloton along with Tudor, catching Visma-Lease a Bike out as they sat at the back. However, it all came to nothing. </p>\n<p>After that acceleration the pace remained high in the peloton as various teams battled to keep their leaders in the best position possible through the narrow streets around the various Belgian villages that litter the landscape. </p>\n<p>Just before the Haaghoek cobbled section of the race, a few riders went down. K√ºng, Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Ryan Mullen (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) were involved, but all continued riding. </p>\n<p>Belgian national champion Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) had a mechanical and needed a bike change with around 70km to go, but he wasn‚Äôt getting back quickly. It took him almost 15km to make his way back onto the rear of the peloton. </p>\n<p>On the Eikenberg, there was an attack by the youngest rider in the race, 19-year-old Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike), along with Vito Braet (Intermarche-Wanty) and Tim van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), but a counter move by Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers) saw it come back together again. </p>\n<p>Then, on the Holleweg cobbled sector, there was an attack by British time trial champion Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers), who rode away solo from the peloton. </p>\n<p>The Molenberg saw the usual splits in the peloton despite not really having much acceleration, but Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), De Lie and defending champion Jan Tratnik (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) all missed the split. </p>\n<p>A group of big favourites got a gap with Alpecin-Deceuninck bossing the group with both Philipsen and Kaden Groves following the wheels of their two teammates. </p>\n<p>With 30km to go, Tarling was caught by the Alpecin-Deceuninck-led group as well as the break getting caught on the Berendries, but Visma were closing things but were still not quite able to close the final gap. </p>\n<p>Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) did one massive turn which dragged the likes of De Lie, Narv√°ez and the rest. However, Van Aert was taking longer to get there before eventually making the split. De Lie was the next rider to get dropped after several huge efforts, and his legs just went pop. </p>\n<p>With 20km to go, the race had its most settled moment for a long time as the team of Philipsen, Alpecin-Deceuninck, led the way as they headed to the Muur Van Geraardsbergen.</p>\n<p>Just at the base of the climb,  defending champion Jan Tratnik had an untimely rear wheel puncture that saw his chances of defending his title go up in smoke. </p>\n<p>As soon as they went onto the Kapelmuur, it was Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) on the front accelerating with Matthias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) taking over with Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers), Narv√°ez, Philipsen and the rest struggling to follow the wheel. </p>\n<p>But, it was still quite a large group all together over the top of the Kapelmuur as Van Aert tried a move over the top to attempt to split the race further. </p>\n<p>The next move to go was Matteo Jorgenson of Visma-Lease a Bike, but everyone was alive to the danger once again. Nothing was being allowed to get away with 15km to go and one cobbled ascent to go on the Bosberg.

The 2,540 metres of vertical climbing was, however, more or less the same as in 2024.</p>\n<p>With the gravel segments all concentrated in the second part of the race, the main contenders opted to let a break of non-favourites gain a significant margin early on. </p>\n<p>As the course wended its way through the olive groves of eastern Andalucia, seven riders went clear: Cl√©ment Alleno (Burgos Burpellet BH), Julen Arriolabengoa (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Yentl Vandevelde (Flanders-Baloise), Edgar Curto and Ricard Fit√≥ (Illes Balears-Arabay), Adri√°n Benito (Selecci√≥n Espa√±ola U23) and Ibon Ruiz (Equipo Kern Pharma).</p>\n<p>By the second hour of racing, the seven had picked up a maximum advantage of five minutes, but when they hit the first, isolated segment of gravel, Visma and Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale had already reduced that advantage to under four and it began to drop even more rapidly.</p>\n<p>As the break splintered under the fast-rising pressure from behind, a dramatic acceleration by Michal Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers) and Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates) some 50 kilometres from the line seemingly caught Wout van Aert by surprise, forcing Visma&#8217;s Sepp Kuss and Ben Tulett to chase. </p>\n<p>The Pole and American quickly caught Alleno from the break and bore down on Arriola-Bengoa and Ruiz, the last two leaders from the early move. Meanwhile, the bunch squeezed down to just 20 riders and Visma &#8211;  by now down to just Van Aert, Tulett and Kuss &#8211; chased hard behind.</p>\n<p>However, a fall for Tulett as he continued to chase on a right-hand bend made it harder to reduce a gap of a minute on the five leaders: Kwiatkowski, McNulty, Alleno, Arriola-Bengoa and Ruiz. Kuss then tried to bridge across, further suggesting that Van Aert was not in great shape, and was happy to follow wheels even as other dangerous riders like Bernal, Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates &#8211; XRG) and Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) shadowed the American.</p>\n<p>Alleno was dropped from the break just as the five leaders reached the longest sector of sterrato, the 6.2 kilometre Guadalupe section and the 20-strong chase group reformed. </p>\n<p>UAE and Ineos not only had a man ahead with McNulty and Kwiatkowski but also had the most in the chasing group with four apiece, whilst Visma continued to find themselves at a numerical disadvantage, having only Kuss and Turner to back the top favourite Van Aert. Arriola, riding a great race for Caja Rural, was unlucky enough to puncture, reducing the break to three, while a searing acceleration by Tulett changed the narrative behind yet again, only for Bernal and Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to briefly test the waters. </p>\n<p>When Van Aert then took charge of the 14 riders chasing the trio of breakaways, driving hard as the race headed towards the finish for the first time, it looked as if the top pre-race favourite had opted to take on a domestique&#8217;s role. </p>\n<p>Additional support from Decathlon-AG2R Jordan Labrosse added much-needed strength to the pursuit, but the small army of UAE riders flanking Van Aert as they reached Ubeda with 34 kilometres to go could hardly have been encouraging for the Belgian.</p>\n<p>Van Aert then sat up as they headed out of the city on a neverending series of minor climbs, sparking a series of attempts to bring across to the tenacious trio of leaders.

Wellens, Labrosse and Bernal came the closest, but each attack was cancelled out and still Kwiatkowski, McNulty and Ruiz remained with a 30-second advantage as they hit the last 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16519&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16519&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The first four editions were reserved to amateurs. Originally the race was held in early March and consisted of five stages. However, due to Spain&#8217;s financial turmoil, the race was scaled back to three stages in 2011 and two stages in 2012. From 2013 to 2018 the Vuelta a Murcia was organised as a single-day race and shifted to mid-February on the international calendar. In 2019 the race was expanded to two stages. It is part of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event. However, due to the postponement of the 2021 edition to May, the race was reverted to its one-day nature, with the expectation that the race will continue as a two-day event in future editions.</p>\n<p>Fabio Christen won the Vuelta a la Regi√≥n de Murcia one-day race in Spain, beating WorldTour rivals to land his first professional victory.</p>\n<p>Christen was alone for Q36.5 Pro Cycling and against three riders from UAE Team Emirates-XRG, three from XDS Astana and a few others, but beat them all with a perfectly executed and powerful sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Tim Wellens led out his UAE Team Emirates-XRG teammate Isaac del Toro but Christen jumped before the young Mexican and opened a gap and surged to victory.</p>\n<p>Aur√©lien Parent-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) took second and Christian Scaroni was third as XDS Astana placed three riders in the top five but Christen and Q36.5 took the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting a lot for this win,  so it means a lot,&#8221; Christen said. &#8220;The team did an amazing job into the last climb. I was suffering, it was really hard to stay on the wheels with the other guys. There were three rider from UAE and Astana, while I was alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I had to go from far out but in the last hundred metres I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d make it, my legs were burning so much. It&#8217;s unbelievable!</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew last season that I had the ability to win a race and I went so close. Finally it has worked out, so I&#8217;m really happy. Now we can look forward to the rest of the season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Vuelta a la Regi√≥n de Murcia covered almost 200km and included three categorised climbs, with the Alto Cresta del Gallo coming just 13km from the finish and so likely to be decisive.</p>\n<p>The UAE Team Emirates-XRG lineup included Brandon McNulty, Tim Wellens, Jhonatan Narv√°ez and Isaac Del Toro, making them the team to beat.</p>\n<p>The early five-rider break was always going to suffer on the climbs and on the Alto Collado Bermejo after 115km, only Jos√© Luis Faura (Burgos Burpellet BH) and Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a (Illes Balears Arabay) stayed out front.</p>\n<p>Del Toro and Wellens went on the attack on the Alto Collado Bermejo and were chased by some quality riders, who sensed the race was about to be decided. They were to be proved right.</p>\n<p>Wellens and Del Toro were joined by several chase groups on the fast descent and so Wellens attacked again. This time Cl√©ment Berthet (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Simone Velasco (XDS Astana) and Eric Fag√∫ndez (Burgos Burpellet BH) joined him, forcing Movistar to pick up the chase.</p>\n<p>At the foot of the Alto Cresta del Gallo, the quartet led by just 20 seconds and so Wellens surged away once again, this time riding for victory. Only Scaroni was able to join him but their gap was just 10 seconds as they started the descent and final 10km to the finish.</p>\n<p>Wellens had Del Toro, McNulty and the impressive development team rider Adri√† Pericas in the chase group, while Champoussin and Fortunato were there for XDS Astana. Christen, Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre and Jordan Labrosse (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Nairo Quintana (Movistar) were also there.</p>\n<p>The final 10km became a thrilling tactical battle. Labrosse rode for Paret-Peintre and chased down a number of attacks as UAE and XDS tried to form small attacks or control others. McNulty was dropped from the group but UAE still expected to dominate the sprint with Del Toro.</p>\n<p>Wellens did a perfect lead out on the streets of Murcia but the Mexican missed the moment when Christen struck out early, failing to get on his wheel, as everyone also suffered on the rise to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Christen got a gap of several bike lengths and could see victory was his, the joy of possible victory cancelling the pain in his legs.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=74&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=74&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A one-day race awards 125 UCI ranking points to the winner, far more than the 20 awarded for a stage win, making the race a big goal for the teams fighting for WorldTour survival.</p>\n<p>The 170.3km race started on the coast to the west of Muscat and then climbed in the foothills behind Oman&#8217;s capital city.</p>\n<p>Adne van Engelen and Muhammad Nur Aiman Mohd Zariff (Terengganu Cycling Team) and Rasmus B√∏gh Wallin (Uno-X Mobility) formed the first break of the day and the peloton allowed them to open a seven-minute gap. Groupama-FDJ, Ark√©a-B&#038;B and UAE Team Emirates-XRG powered the chase as the riders began the hilly laps south of Muscat with 58km to race.</p>\n<p>Max Kanter (XDS-Astana), Rayan Boulahoite (TotalEnergies), Xabier Azparren (Q36.5) and Lorenzo Germani (Groupama-FDJ) tried to anticipate the attacks on the final lap, catching van Engelen, but they were gradually pulled back on the Hamriya climb with 25km to race.</p>\n<p>Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal Quick-Step), Vine and Harper made their surge on the Hamriya climb, joined Germani and then pushed on the approach to the steep Al Jissah climb. Tudor Pro Cycling and Picnic-PostNL tried to keep them in control as other riders were dropped by the peloton.</p>\n<p>Vine and Harper stayed away and were joined by a Movistar rider over the top of the barren Al Jissah climb. They dived down the fast, wide road to the Al Bustan palace at over 100km/h. They seemed clear but the peloton could see them and the gap closed before the final roundabout turn.</p>\n<p>As the finish line appeared, the 30 caesars swept up the attackers. Pluimers let other riders lead out the sprint but then surged along the barriers to take his first professional victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18946&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18946&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is held a few days before the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. It is rated as a 1.1 event on the UCI Oceania Tour. In 2024 the race was renamed as the Geelong Classic for Women and Surf Coast Classic for men.</p>\n<p>Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL) flew across the line in first place after an action-packed edition of the men&#8217;s Surf Coast Classic where both the climbs, crosswinds and a determination to take the sting out of the sprint of the dominant finishing force of Sam Welsford (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) set the race alight. </p>\n<p>Andresen overcame the Australian, who was feeling the impacts of the tough 157km day at the 1.1 event from Lorne to Torquay that acts as an entree to the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road race. Tim Torn Teutenberg (Lidl-Trek) was third which means, that after some near misses in South Australia, the 22-year-old has already managed to pull off his first podium place after spending less than a month in the WorldTour.</p>\n<p>It too was an early season achievement for Andresen, who had the aim of taking his first one-day win this year and pulled it off before January was over when he claimed the challenging sprint, which has a left-hand turn into the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was around the corner in Sam&#8217;s wheel in, like fifth position, so I was very happy,&#8221; said Andresen in Torquay as he looked back at what was going through his mind during that winning effort. &#8220;But then, yeah, I got swarmed so that moment you just have to stay calm ‚Äì you&#8217;re not going to get anything out of rushing yourself.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;A bit lucky for me, Teutenberg, he opened up an early sprint so I followed his wheel and then when you see a finish line, you don&#8217;t think about anything else than just getting there first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were plenty of moments, however, before the final run-in on the aggressive day of racing when there was doubt about whether it might even come down to a final bunch charge throughout, with the final move of reeled-in being a break of Casper Pedersen (Soudal-QuickStep), Kelland O‚ÄôBrien (Jayco-AlUla) and Michal Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers) that was caught in the final kilometres.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIt was the second edition of the Surf Coast Classic for the men, with the 157km race setting off from Lorne in mild conditions after a foreshore sign-on, with a backdrop of surfers out in the waves.</p>\n<p>The 1.1 race covered much the same terrain as Wednesday‚Äôs women‚Äôs event, only differing in the fact that to add in another 40km it looped out to Forrest ‚Äì a town with a labyrinth of mountain bike trails hidden among the trees. There was no change to the brutal start, however, with riders out on the 10km climb before the race got underway so they were ready to react to what was to come.</p>\n<p>There were, of course, attacks as soon as the flag dropped on the ascent, with solo efforts inspiring groups and then turning into splits. There were also plenty of riders slipping off the back, hoping that they would be able to bridge again once it eased. Some could but others among the long tail of riders chasing once the race went through Dean‚Äôs Marsh, couldn‚Äôt,</p>\n<p>As the race set off through Barwon Downs and on to Forrest the attacks kept flying, as well as the splits but it was not until it had ticked down to around 100km left in the race that a prolonged group got away out front. First, it was around 15 and then the peloton split again as another group peeled off in pursuit, catching the initial bunch and swelling the number to around 40. The group was well populated by riders from Picnic PostNL, EF Education‚ÄìEasypost, LidL-Trek and Soudal-Quickstep, with Mauro Schmid among them for Jayco-AlUla. </p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe was pushing the chase behind but the gap just kept stretching, creeping up to around 35 seconds by the time they went through the second feed zone with 75km left to go and it then stretched out to over a minute with around 60km to go. After that, the reeling-in started and by the time the race had around 40km to go the gap was down to 30 seconds, with Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe on the chase once again.</p>\n<p>At 35km to go the catch was made, and that of course opened the door again with the bunch being stretched, splits and multiple attacks occurring and then the crosswinds hit. The pressure was on and the field was split into multiple groups at 28km to go, while nine riders were out the front. </p>\n<p>There was some coming together behind of the groups behind but Ineos Grenadiers was in the box seat out front with four in the leading group and gap of about 20 seconds with around 20km to go. The group contained Lucas Hamilton, Michael Kwiatkowski, Ben Swift and Geraint Thomas for Ineos Grenadiers and also Casper Pedersen (Soudal-QuickStep), Sven Erik Bystr√∏m (Groupama-FDJ), Kelland O‚ÄôBrien (Jayco-AlUla), Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) and Bryan Coquard (Cofidis). </p>\n<p>It then turned into a group of three, Pedersen, O‚ÄôBrien and Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers) but they were caught in the final kilometres leaving the action-paced race to be decided with a challenging sprint, especially given many lead-out teams had been drained by such a hard day of racing.</p>\n<p>When a spent Welsford launched from his, jumping onto the right wheel proved to be Andresen&#8217;s salvation.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13182&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13182&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2024 the race was renamed as the Geelong Classic for Women and Surf Coast Classic for men.</p>\n<p>Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) claimed the first win of the season for her new team FDJ-Suez, charging across the line ahead of Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) with an assured sprint at the first edition of the women&#8217;s 1.1 ranked women&#8217;s Surf Coast Classic ‚Äì a 118km mid-week race to kick off the action before Saturday&#8217;s Women&#8217;s WorldTour event at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. </p>\n<p>The rider from New Zealand had already made it obvious in South Australia that she had the form, winning the bunch sprint for second place on stage 1 of the Santos Tour Down Under.</p>\n<p>Wollaston, second at Hangar Point behind breakaway rider Daniek Hangeveld, just needed the opportunity to deliver when the top step was at stake and Wednesday turned out to be her day. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really, really strong today,&#8221; said Wollaston at the end of the race which started in Lorne with a long climb and then ended back on the coast at Torquay after looping inland.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last few races maybe I&#8217;ve struggled mentally, I think, to really stay present in the race and stay attentive and be confident enough that I&#8217;m good enough to be there in the final.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, as soon as I started climbing, I knew I had a good shot at the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was a clear-cut victory for Wollaston, ahead of Dygert but the battle for third was tight, with Georgia Baker (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) making it to the podium steps for a second time this week after having come second at the 1.Pro Schwalbe One Day Classic in Adelaide. The winner of that race, Clara Copponi (Lidl-Trek), was fourth this time.</p>\n<p>The two podiums perhaps mean all that much more to Baker given that they were an unexpected bonus considering the recovery process after being hit by a car in Spain in September. That left her grappling with a concussion that took a long time to recover from, so it was only in mid-November that she could start working her way back to fitness on the bike.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Getting back after my injury at the end of last year I thought my role would be as more of a domestique over the summer but these opportunities came up within the team and I&#8217;m just really happy to be on the podium,&#8221; said Baker, who added that the Australian squad had worked hard for her all day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really good sign for the team for the year ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was still an echo of the summer holiday mood in the coastal town of Lorne which hosted the race start but it was straight into the hard work for the riders as they confronted a challenging course for the new 1.1-ranked addition to the calendar. </p>\n<p>The teams were getting ready to race with the beach just metres away, the red and yellow flags of the lifeguard-patrolled section flapped in the breeze in the background and the inquisitive cockatoos dropped by on the picnic tables where they were getting ready.</p>\n<p>The nearby water may have been the most popular spot in town when the riders rolled in from Adelaide on Monday to temperatures of around 40¬∞C, but that had almost halved for race day so the water was quiet but the roads weren‚Äôt. </p>\n<p>The race had barely rolled off the start line before heading straight into a challenging 10km climb as the peloton worked its way inland to Deans Marsh. There were several attacks on the climb, with UAE Team ADQ a regular on the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Still, more riders were going off the back than off the front. While no move stuck, the pressure was certainly on, causing a split in the peloton as it topped the climb, leaving many with a tough early chase.</p>\n<p>As the race headed through Deans Marsh with 96km to go there were many riders off behind ‚Äì some in touch with the convoy but others well behind. They included Canyon-SRAM zondacryprto‚Äôs Maike van der Duin and Tiffany Cromwell, Silvia Zanardi (Human Powered Health), and Maeve Plouffe (ARA Cycling).</p>\n<p>More attacks rolled and were caught and, with a little more than 70km of racing to go, there was another substantial split in the field, with 20 riders off the front. The next move was a solo effort with Julie van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) stretching out a gap that hit 30 seconds with around 55km to go.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it was another of those fleeting breakaways, caught before the feed zone in the farmland alongside the Wurdiboluc Picnic Area with 43km of racing left.</p>\n<p>The peloton bunched, surged, and then bunched again several times as it started to head out of the hills and paddocks and drew ever closer to the coast. It didn‚Äôt deliver fierce enough crosswinds to really help substantially with any splits but that didn&#8217;t stop prevent the many heated battles.</p>\n<p>At nearly 10km, heading toward Bells Beach the group was still all together and while there were attempts to get away in the stretched-out run to the line, ultimately it all came down to a bunch sprint, with Wollaston put into position by her teammates while Dygert surfing the wheels after the team plan switched to her halfway through after sprinter Van der Duin got set back on the climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a good day and the finish, it was super ideal for me getting it strung out,&#8221; said Dygert of the run to the finish line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was kind of on my own there, so surfing a little bit, and I had to come the long way around but even sprinting against Ally, I think she still would have gotten me even if I had a perfect day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, the perfect day was all Wollaston&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24908&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24908&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2023, the race was upgraded to category 1.1. it is now named after Luis Puig, a prominent Spanish sports executive who server as president of the Union Cycliste Internationale.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=411&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=411&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2023, it has been on the UCI ProSeries calendar, having previously been on the UCI Europe Tour calendar as a 1.1 rated event.</p>\n<p>Magnus Cort (Uno-X Mobility) won the Veneto Classic on the final day of the European road season. He was part of a six-rider breakaway who moved away from the peloton in the opening 25km and launched a solo attack on the Diesel Farm climb with 10km remaining to score the victory.</p>\n<p>Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) finished 16 seconds back in the chase for second. Meurisse Xandro Meurisse (Alpecin-Deceuninck) outsprinted 2022 Veneto winner Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) for the final podium spot another two seconds back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the perfect way for me to end the season,&#8221; Cort said at the finish. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty spectacular race, maybe not one of the big classics, but I am happy and proud how I rode it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The reason I wanted to get in the breakaway was because of that hill [La Tisa]. I knew if we could come in on the laps with the cobblestone climb and have a gap in there, we could go a really long way because it is a very difficult climb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cort was among a trio of the six original riders in the breakaway to continue on five difficult circuits that included a cobbled &#8216;wall&#8217; of La Tisa (330m at 15.5%). He then used a gravel ascent of Diesel Farm (1.3km at 10.9%) to go clear on his own.</p>\n<p>The fourth edition of this 1.Pro contest featured 195km from Soave to Bassano del Grappa on north-east Italy. The course featured two ascents of La Rosina (2.1km at 6.5%) on a 12.6km circuit completed twice, then tackled the La Tisa circuit, with five passes over La Tisa. The final challenge was the sharp Diesel Farm gravel climb followed by the Contr√† Soarda (400m at 134%), within 2.5km to the finish at Piazza Libert√†.</p>\n<p>The race saw multiple attacks from the start but nothing sticking early on. Finally, a group of six gained more than a minute after 30km of racing &#8211; Magnus Cort (Uno-X Mobility), Anders Foldager (Jayco-AlUla), Alexis Gougeard (Cofidis), Tobias Bayer (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Kyrylo Tsarenko (Team Corratec &#8211; Vini Fantini) and Riccardo Biondani (General Store &#8211; Essegibi &#8211; F.Lli Curia).</p>\n<p>Another 100km on the six held a steady lead that reached 2:40. Tsarenko, Biondani and Gougeard had dropped back to the peloton with under 60km to race. Then the attacks began to fire as the peloton approached the base of the La Tisa for the first time. </p>\n<p>Cort, Bayer and Foldager held a 1:20 advantage with 23km to go, but a calvary of six pressed from behind, comprised of New Zealander George Bennett (Israel-Premier Tech) and five Italians &#8211; Filippo Baroncini (UAE Team Emirates), Davide De Pretto (Jayco-AlUla), Simone Gualdi (Wanty-ReUz-Technord), Lorenzo Rota (intermarch√©-Wanty) and Giulio Pellizzari (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Once off the gravel for a fifth and final time, the leading trio&#8217;s advantage was down to 30 seconds for the final 10 kilometres.</p>\n<p>Cort attacked on the Diesel Farm ascent for a solo effort. His breakaway companions were soon passed by Pellizzari and a resurgent effort by three others who had made inroads from the reduced peloton, Filippo Zana (Jayco-AlUla), Hirschi, and Gr√©goire.</p>\n<p>On the Strada Soarda with 4.6km to go, Gr√©goire launched his solo effort to catch Cort, but ran out of cobbles to make the catch as the Dane had crossed the line for his fourth victory of the season.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15208&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15208&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2023, the race has been on the UCI ProSeries calendar, having previously been a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. In 2012 the race merged with another Italian classic, Coppa Placci, after some financial problems, and was held under the name &#8220;Giro Del Veneto ‚Äì Coppa Placci&#8221;. It was to be the last edition for 9 years. In 2021, after a hiatus of 9 years, the race returned under its original name &#8220;Giro del Veneto&#8221;.</p>\n<p>New Zealander Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) clipped away from a small front group on the final ascent of the Giro del Veneto to claim victory in a rain-soaked edition of the late-season Italian Classic.</p>\n<p>Second in the 165.3 kilometre 1.Pro event was Xandro Meurisse (Deceuninck-Alpecin), with Romain Gregoire (Groupama-FDJ) in third.</p>\n<p>The very hilly late-season race came down to the final kilometre grinding ascent in Vicenza, where Strong surged away from a group of some 20 riders close to the line for the fourth win of his career.</p>\n<p>The all-conquering UAE Team Emirates had done their utmost to control the rugged one-day race, working for pre-race favourite Marc Hirschi and bringing back one break after another. But despite Jay Vine&#8217;s best efforts in the closing kilometres, Strong&#8217;s late move proved too powerful to match.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I did this one last year and it was a perfect finish for me,&#8221; Strong, who showed good form in the Gran Piemonte when he led the chase group home behind lone winner Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), said afterwards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been motivated to finish the season strong and it feels really good to get the win today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a technical finish, one I got completely wrong last year, but my team did a great job and I was really hungry to get a result. I got a little bit boxed in but I had the confidence to go long, go early and it paid off in the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nNot even a grey, damp day in north-eastern Italy and the imminent prospect of the end of the season could discourage seven riders &#8211; Kevin Pezzo (General Store &#8211; Essegibi &#8211; F.Lli Curia), Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar), Davide Baldaccini (Corratec-Vini Fantini), Adne Holter (Uno-X Mobility), German Dario G√≥mez (Polti-Kometa), Ben Granger (Mg.K Vis &#8211; Colors for Peace) and former Canadian National Champion Nickolas Zukowsky (Q36.5) &#8211;  from opening up hostilities in this year&#8217;s Giro del Veneto. </p>\n<p>Milesi&#8217;s early enthusiasm reached the unluckiest of setbacks, however, when he soon crashed and abandoned. But the remaining six pressed on and they still held an advantage of nearly two minutes as they approached the 15-kilometre, very hilly finishing circuit for the first time and spots of rain began to fall.</p>\n<p>Following a pronounced acceleration in the peloton, the six-rider break tried to respond by picking up speed. But it promptly began to crumble thanks to its own raised impetus and some 48 kilometres from the finish the last survivors were reeled in. </p>\n<p>Even so and despite some brief test moves, the steadily worsening weather, and a demanding course, when the crunch moments of the finale approached an unusually large pack of some 70 or 80 riders still remained in the mix for the win.</p>\n<p>Perhaps thanks to the sizeable pack, one brief dig by Remy Rochas (Groupama-FDJ) between the two ascents of Monte Berico and Torre Arcugnano failed to gain traction. Then when Marcel Camprubi (36.5 Pro Cycling Team) and Alessandro Tonelli (VF Group &#8211; Bardiani CSF &#8211; Faizan√®) launched similar surprise moves and gained a handful of seconds on the flatter part of the circuit they both met an identical fate.</p>\n<p>Despite the evident volatility inside the bunch, the presence of expert UAE racers Diego Ulissi and Jay Vine on the front each time a break needed chasing down indicated the shape of things to come. Finally, 28 kilometres from the line, one of the top favourites, UAE teammate Marc Hirschi made enough of an effort to carve out a 14-rider group on the front.</p>\n<p>A driving surge by Italian veteran Gianluca Brambilla (Q36.5)  from out of that large break looked more promising, but the final ascent of the Berico climb put paid to Brambilla&#8217;s effort as Vine stepped up to the plate yet again. </p>\n<p>The Australian&#8217;s repeated efforts then proved an effective launchpad for the most dangerous-looking attack of the race finale, when Hirschi accelerated on the much gentler Torre Arcugnano ascent with 11 kilometres to go and Filippo Zana (Jayco AIUIa), Samuele Battistella (Astana Qazaqstan) and Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) subsequently came across.</p>\n<p>However, as soon as the quartet gained even the smallest of gaps, their failure to collaborate allowed first Tobias Halland Johannessen (UNo-X-Mobility) to latch on behind and this culminated in the umpteenth remerging of the front pack of some 20 riders. When Hirschi pressed on, his solo bid to put his 2024 win tally into 10 digits was swiftly ended.</p>\n<p>Four kilometres from the finish Giulio Pellizzari (VF Group &#8211; Bardiani CSF &#8211; Faizan√®) tried his best, only for the rising speed as the kilometre-long ascent to the line approached to extinguish his challenge. </p>\n<p>Israel-Premier Tech kept the pace just high enough to ensure that Strong could power off almost unchallenged with about 400 metres to go, and they did an impressive job. Then although Meurisse and Gregoire were both quick to react, on the line the 24-year-old still had enough of a gap to raise his arms more than a bike-length clear of his closest opponents.</p>\n<p>The final race of the European season, the very hilly Veneto Classic will be held on Sunday in nearby Bassano del Grappa, with Strong part of the peloton again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a different race, and if it rains it&#8217;ll be a filthy one with the gravel [sections] at the finish. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m looking forward to it as much after such a successful race today, but it&#8217;ll be a nice one to finish off the season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=183&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=183&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is traditionally the last of the five &#8216;Monuments&#8217; of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling, and one of the last events on the UCI World Tour calendar. Nicknamed the Classica delle foglie morte (&#8220;the Classic of the falling (dead) leaves&#8221;), it is the most important Autumn Classic in cycling. The race&#8217;s most famous climb is the Madonna del Ghisallo in the race finale.</p>\n<p>World champion Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates) capped off perhaps the greatest cycling season of all time with a fourth Il Lombardia title in a row, producing a stunning 48.4km solo effort to add a second Monument to his Giro, Tour and Worlds triumphs in 2024.</p>\n<p>Resplendent in the rainbow jersey, the Slovenian was led perfectly by his UAE Emirates teammates to the key Colma di Sormano climb after they reeled in a strong 23-man breakaway, before exploding out of last man Pavel Sivakov&#8217;s wheel and riding solo to the line.</p>\n<p>Such was Pogaƒçar&#8217;s dominance that his eventual winning margin from Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) in second was 3:15, the biggest since Eddy Merckx, the man to whom he is so often compared, soloed to Il Lombardia victory in 1971 also in Como and also in the world champion&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Enric Mas (Movistar) were the next best on the Sormano climb but even they could not mount a response to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s initial attack, with Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto Dstny) eventually bridging across to fight out the podium spots.</p>\n<p>The Olympic champion Evenepoel went solo on the descent of the Sormano after failing to cooperate with his compatriot and Mas, however, he made little impression on Pogaƒçar&#8217;s rapidly built lead despite riding alone to second. It was an emotional podium for Evenepoel after returning to Como for the first time since his horror crash at the 2020 Lombardia.</p>\n<p>There was joy for the Italians on home ground as Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) eventually took third after chasing down the three-man group containing Van Eetvelt, Mas and Sivakov in the final 3km and stealing a march on them once they reached Como.</p>\n<p>With this victory, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s 25th in 2024, he became only the second rider to win four Il Lombardias in a row after the great Fausto Coppi 75 years ago. He also equalled Alfredo Binda&#8217;s total of four wins in Lombardia, the second most behind only Coppi on five, and now holds the same amount of Monuments of fellow Italian great Gino Bartali, Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara on seven.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every victory is special, and today also, because the team worked so hard all year for all the victories that we achieved, and today is no different. It was a big day for us; a long race, a hard race, and it was all dependent on our team. We did a good job and I&#8217;m super happy to win with the team,&#8221; said Pogaƒçar in his post-race interview, confirming that the Sormano launch was, of course, the plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We planned this because the race is so hard that in the end, the last 40km is more or less man-to-man, and I knew that if I had a decent gap at the top, I could manage to come to the finish. You never know if it happens, or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite managing another history-making ride, Pogaƒçar was more focused on the task at hand and the roaring crowds that welcomed him throughout the 255km route, not the place he holds among cycling&#8217;s all-time greats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see where we will be after the career,&#8221; he said when asked if he could now think about history with his stunning 2024 season coming to an end. &#8220;I was enjoying the crowds. I&#8217;m looking forward to the off-season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nBeautiful golden skies welcomed the riders in Bergamo as they set off for the 118th edition of Il Lombardia with a slightly changed 255km route, due to flooding, awaiting them.</p>\n<p>The start was active right from the flag drop, with several of the 25 teams trying to get someone into the day&#8217;s break. The first of which was a three-man move of Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Tobias Bayer (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Giulio Masotto (Corratec-Vini Fantini) but they were quickly caught midway up the first climb to Forcellino di Bianzano.</p>\n<p>With the 11.4km Selvino climb approaching, the next wave of attacks came and with 200km to go, a front group of Axel Laurance (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matej Mohoriƒç, Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain-Victorious), R√©my Rochas (Groupama-FDJ), Brandon Rivera (Ineos Grenadiers), Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek), Einer Rubio (Movistar), Martijn Tusveld (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla), Matteo Fabro (Polti Kometa), Wilco Kelderman (Visma-Lease a Bike) Harold L√≥pez (Astana Qazaqstan) and Dani Martinez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) had formed.</p>\n<p>Tiberi was a late addition after bridging across and immediately came to the front with Mohoriƒç to try and get away from the UAE Emirates-led peloton behind who sat just 34 seconds down. </p>\n<p>Bastein Tronchon (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) made the jump to try and come across which looked futile until he was joined by another big group on the descent of the Selvino, Rivera being the first after getting dropped and trying again alongside teammate Thymen Arensman, Xandro Meurisse (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Victorious), Rudy Molard (Groupama-FDJ), Gregor M√ºhlberger (Movistar), Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep), Kevin Vermaerke (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Anders Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>With 170km to go, the racing in front came together and a lead group of 23 had formed and built an advantage of 2:23, with Bahrain best represented by three riders and all of Visma, DSM, Ineos, FDJ, Alpecin and Movistar having two riders in front. </p>\n<p>As the racing headed northwest away from Bergamo and into a 60km section without any climbing, UAE allowed the break&#8217;s lead to grow upwards of 4:30 with Finn Fisher-Black and Jan Christen doing much of the work in the early phase. </p>\n<p>At the foot of the next ascent to Sella di Osigo and run up to the fabled Madonna del Ghisallo climb, UAE re-established full control through Christen and Majka who began to make serious inroads into the deficit as racing entered the final 90km. </p>\n<p>By the time the peloton had reached the historic chapel, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s ever-reliable domestique Majka had reduced the gap back down to 2:30 and the break had begun to lose members as the struggle set in fully. </p>\n<p>The key climb to Colma di Sormano (12.9km at 6.4%) was talked about a lot before the race as the expected launch pad for the world champion, and his team showed all the signs of confirming this with Adam Yates taking over for UAE at the foot with only 1:02 to get back after the escapees faded.</p>\n<p>Molard and Meurisse tried moves with little chance of a result still possible, with the Belgian and Arensman being the last survivors of the original 23-man group. However, the blast off from Pogaƒçar was imminent as Yates pulled off and left only Sivakov in front of the rainbow bands, with Olympic champion Evenepoel locked into his wheel ready for the surge.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar made his move 48.4km from the line, exploding out of Sivakov&#8217;s wheel without response and quickly finding himself alone with just 6.3km of the climb to navigate and the descent into Como. </p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Mas were the next best as the peloton completely splintered under the Slovenian&#8217;s pressure, with Lennert van Eetvelt (Lotto Dstny) bridging across on his own. As the gap extended past the minute mark and Evenepoel&#8217;s frustration building, he set off on his own down the Sormano descent. </p>\n<p>He rode well solo behind the eventual race winner, however, only lost more time on the mainly flat run-in, with Mas and Van Eetvelt eventually being joined by Sivakov behind after failing to cooperate well. </p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar navigated the descents and reached the final small climb, San Fermo, with a 2:23 lead on Evenepoel and 4:20 to the three-man chasing group containing his teammate. </p>\n<p>This climb is where the third chase group came back after a long while off the back, with Lidl-Trek working well for Ciccone to bridge across solo. The Italian then brought joy to the home nation as he attacked almost instantly and rode home to cross the line third after Evenepoel and Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar held his bike aloft in celebration with rainbows all over his kit and equipment, closing out his and the European racing season with a bang.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

You never know if it happens, or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite managing another history-making ride, Pogaƒçar was more focused on the task at hand and the roaring crowds that welcomed him throughout the 255km route, not the place he holds among cycling&#8217;s all-time greats.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see where we will be after the career,&#8221; he said when asked if he could now think about history with his stunning 2024 season coming to an end. &#8220;I was enjoying the crowds. I&#8217;m looking forward to the off-season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nBeautiful golden skies welcomed the riders in Bergamo as they set off for the 118th edition of Il Lombardia with a slightly changed 255km route, due to flooding, awaiting them.</p>\n<p>The start was active right from the flag drop, with several of the 25 teams trying to get someone into the day&#8217;s break. The first of which was a three-man move of Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Tobias Bayer (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Giulio Masotto (Corratec-Vini Fantini) but they were quickly caught midway up the first climb to Forcellino di Bianzano.</p>\n<p>With the 11.4km Selvino climb approaching, the next wave of attacks came and with 200km to go, a front group of Axel Laurance (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matej Mohoriƒç, Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain-Victorious), R√©my Rochas (Groupama-FDJ), Brandon Rivera (Ineos Grenadiers), Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek), Einer Rubio (Movistar), Martijn Tusveld (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla), Matteo Fabro (Polti Kometa), Wilco Kelderman (Visma-Lease a Bike) Harold L√≥pez (Astana Qazaqstan) and Dani Martinez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) had formed.</p>\n<p>Tiberi was a late addition after bridging across and immediately came to the front with Mohoriƒç to try and get away from the UAE Emirates-led peloton behind who sat just 34 seconds down. </p>\n<p>Bastein Tronchon (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) made the jump to try and come across which looked futile until he was joined by another big group on the descent of the Selvino, Rivera being the first after getting dropped and trying again alongside teammate Thymen Arensman, Xandro Meurisse (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Victorious), Rudy Molard (Groupama-FDJ), Gregor M√ºhlberger (Movistar), Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep), Kevin Vermaerke (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Anders Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>With 170km to go, the racing in front came together and a lead group of 23 had formed and built an advantage of 2:23, with Bahrain best represented by three riders and all of Visma, DSM, Ineos, FDJ, Alpecin and Movistar having two riders in front. </p>\n<p>As the racing headed northwest away from Bergamo and into a 60km section without any climbing, UAE allowed the break&#8217;s lead to grow upwards of 4:30 with Finn Fisher-Black and Jan Christen doing much of the work in the early phase. </p>\n<p>At the foot of the next ascent to Sella di Osigo and run up to the fabled Madonna del Ghisallo climb, UAE re-established full control through Christen and Majka who began to make serious inroads into the deficit as racing entered the final 90km. </p>\n<p>By the time the peloton had reached the historic chapel, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s ever-reliable domestique Majka had reduced the gap back down to 2:30 and the break had begun to lose members as the struggle set in fully. </p>\n<p>The key climb to Colma di Sormano (12.9km at 6.4%) was talked about a lot before the race as the expected launch pad for the world champion, and his team showed all the signs of confirming this with Adam Yates taking over for UAE at the foot with only 1:02 to get back after the escapees faded.</p>\n<p>Molard and Meurisse tried moves with little chance of a result still possible, with the Belgian and Arensman being the last survivors of the original 23-man group. However, the blast off from Pogaƒçar was imminent as Yates pulled off and left only Sivakov in front of the rainbow bands, with Olympic champion Evenepoel locked into his wheel ready for the surge.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar made his move 48.4km from the line, exploding out of Sivakov&#8217;s wheel without response and quickly finding himself alone with just 6.3km of the climb to navigate and the descent into Como. </p>\n<p>Evenepoel and Mas were the next best as the peloton completely splintered under the Slovenian&#8217;s pressure, with Lennert van Eetvelt (Lotto Dstny) bridging across on his own. As the gap extended past the minute mark and Evenepoel&#8217;s frustration building, he set off on his own down the Sormano descent. </p>\n<p>He rode well solo behind the eventual race winner, however, only lost more time on the mainly flat run-in, with Mas and Van Eetvelt eventually being joined by Sivakov behind after failing to cooperate well. </p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar navigated the descents and reached the final small climb, San Fermo, with a 2:23 lead on Evenepoel and 4:20 to the three-man chasing group containing his teammate. </p>\n<p>This climb is where the third chase group came back after a long while off the back, with Lidl-Trek working well for Ciccone to bridge across solo. The Italian then brought joy to the home nation as he attacked almost instantly and rode home to cross the line third after Evenepoel and Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar held his bike aloft in celebration with rainbows all over his kit and equipment, closing out his and the European racing season with a bang.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race first took place in 1906. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 1.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour.</p>\n<p>Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) converted a 42km solo attack into his first victory of the season at Gran Piemonte, holding off a large chase group on the run into Borgomanero to secure a memorable triumph.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) won the sprint for second place, seven seconds behind Powless. The New Zealander led home Alex Aranburu (Movistar) and the remainder of a disorganised chase group which had lay within 30 seconds of Powless for almost the entirety of the previous 20km.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt many feelings in the world that can compare to this one,‚Äù Powless said later. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something that every cyclist works so hard all year to hopefully put it together on a day that matters. I‚Äôm just so happy that I could put it together today.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was just racing on instinct all the way from the long climb with 60km to go. It was just getting really tactical because there were 20 riders at the bottom of the descent, so riders started attacking. I asked Georg [Steinhauser] to follow a move when Trek attacked but I countered and then that was the move that stuck.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI looked back quite a few times. I wasn‚Äôt sure what the gaps were so I just kept looking back to gauge who was chasing and where I was. In the end, I just gave my best effort, I rode harder on the climbs and a bit slower on the flat just to keep it steady.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The win marks a comeback for Powless, who saw his early season ruined by knee pain. He thanked his family for supporting him through his battle to full fitness.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI just feel so incredibly happy and thankful to have put all the bad times behind me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe spring didn‚Äôt go so smooth for me, but my family stuck with me and supported me through all the rehabilitation that I needed to do.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWith all the long hours training, the camps, and the time away at races, it‚Äôs just incredible what my family does for me to chase my dream, but today it feels like it‚Äôs paying off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Powless had taken off alone on the second of three major climbs in the second half of the race, the Cremosina hill. He had earlier made it into a select lead group which caught up with the early breakaway over the Passo della Colma, the toughest climb of the day.</p>\n<p>Finding himself out front in a group of 20 alongside riders including Aranburu, Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek), he took his chance among the flurry of attacks and went solo.</p>\n<p>Despite a two-man chase featuring Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek) and Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and later a larger chase numbering 40 or so, Powless had built a gap large enough to stay away.</p>\n<p>Powless never had more than a minute over the main group, with his advantage dwindling in the final 20km, but he persevered and stuck it out to score his first win since the overall title at the Etoile de Bess√®ges last February.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe ever-changing route of the Gran Piemonte this year saw the peloton take on a 182km race from Valdengo to Borgomanero. The parcours, suited to puncheurs over dedicated sprinters or climbers, as has been the case several times in recent years.</p>\n<p>An opening 110km run on the flatlands west of Milan gave way to a hiller final 70km, with the Passo della Colma (8.6km at 5.5%) the first and toughest challenge of the race.</p>\n<p>Barely a metre of flat ground featured the rest of the way. The climbs of Cremosina (4.9km at 2.9%) and Traversagna (3.1km at 4%) featured over the next 40km, before the closing circuit in Borgomanero and two ascents of the smaller Maggiora hill (800m at 5.6%) before the finish.</p>\n<p>The break of the day went clear in the opening 20km of the race, with Nickolas Zukowsky (Q36.5) joined out front by Luca Colnaghi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®), Andrii Ponomar (Corratec-Vini Fantini) and Francisco Mu√±oz (Polti-Kometa).</p>\n<p>Behind the quartet, teams including Alpecin-Deceuninck, DSM-Firmenich PostNL and EF Education-EasyPost joined in the pacemaking over the flat opening half. Up front, the break‚Äôs advantage grew up to six minutes as the climbs approached.</p>\n<p>It was on the Passo della Colma where the first fractures appeared in the breakaway, with Colnaghi and then Mu√±oz falling away. Behind the leaders, attacks from Kevin Vermaerke (DSM-Firmenich PostNL) and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) led to a new composition at the front.</p>\n<p>The pair were joined in the new lead group by the likes of Powless, Pidcock, Aranburu and three-quarters of the break, minus Colnaghi.</p>\n<p>The group of 17 made headway on the remainder of the climb and the way down the other side, though Powless was restless and made another jump on the Cremosina climb, 42km from the finish.</p>\n<p>The American was chased by Bernard and Zimmermann, while further back several larger groups were split across the road. At 33km to go, the remains of the left-behind break were swallowed up by one of those chase groups, resulting in a group of around 40.</p>\n<p>Further back, a group including several fast finishers ‚Äì Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Iv√°n Garc√≠a Cortina (Movistar) ‚Äì dropped on the Colma, chased at 1:40 behind Powless and with a minute to make up on the main chase group.</p>\n<p>With 20km to go, Powless was the sole racer left out ahead as Bernard and Zimmermann were brought back while the main chasing group closed in. 5km later, the group lay 30 seconds down on the EF racer, while at another 1:10 behind there seemed to be little cooperation in the next chase group.</p>\n<p>Despite the efforts of the main chase behind Powless, he raced into the closing lap, the final 10km, of the race still holding a 30-second advantage over the chasing group as Lidl-Trek lost both Bernard and Sam Oomen to a crash, hindering the chase.</p>\n<p>Behind him, however, the attacks were flying from riders including Alessandro Covi (UAE Team Emirates) and Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility). The moves cut Powless‚Äô lead in half, and the race hit the final 5km with those 15 seconds separating the leaders.</p>\n<p>At 3km to go, Powless still enjoyed that same advantage, and he had the luxury of a few more seconds as he raced under the flamme rouge. Uno-X Mobility appeared the most organised team in the final throes of the chase, setting up the sprint for the line.</p>\n<p>However, upfront, Powless still had time to spare, and the 28-year-old even had time to sit up and celebrate as he approached the line.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the sprint for the minor placings unfolded with Strong and Aranburu leading home the disappointed chase group to secure the remaining podium places.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=61&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=61&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Kerbaol then held off the chase from Liane Lippert (Movistar) and Persico.</p>\n<p>It was a brutal day of racing in Northern Italy as adverse weather conditions sparked two shortenings of the original 136.3km route. The rain-soaked and fragmented peloton came home in small groups behind Kerbaol.</p>\n<p>Having won a stage of the Tour de France Femmes thanks to her expert downhill and time-trialling abilities earlier in the season, Kerbaol showed off the same skills as she navigated the slippery roads, before launching to an eighth career win.</p>\n<p>Persico sat on defending champion Lippert&#8217;s wheel after the German bridged across to her out of the group behind and tried to pull back Kerbaol unsuccessfully, before outsprinting her to second place 20 seconds after the Frenchwoman crossed the line.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe action kicked off in the fourth Tre Valli Varesine women&#8217;s race even before the flag dropped, with an early circuit in Busto Arsizio and two of the 15.8km final circuit laps to be removed due to heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Despite the brutal conditions, several moves tried to get away on the wet roads, the strongest of which included defending champion Lippert. The day&#8217;s main breakaway formed with 75 km to go, with Mareille Meijering (Movistar), Flora Perkins (Fenix-Deceuninck), Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health), Francesca Barale (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Persico, Joscelin Lowden (Uno-X Mobility) and Monica Trinca Colonel (Bepink-Bongioanni) going clear.</p>\n<p>As another lap was taken out of the racing in the worsening conditions, the break&#8217;s gap extended out past the minute mark 35 km from the finish, with Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (Liv AlUla Jayco) doing much of the pulling in the heavily reduced chase group.</p>\n<p>Meijering was the first rider in the break to bite in the final two laps, attacking her fellow escapees, however, she quickly knocked off her effort and began sitting at the back. This seemed like an instruction as 10km later, the break had been caught and Lippert was one of several riders to bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>On the climb up to Varese before the final lap, more attacks followed, first through French champion Juliette Labous (DSM-Firmenich PostNL). Then former junior world champion Julie Bego (Cofidis) attacked alone on the key Montello (2 km at 5.2%) climb.</p>\n<p>Labous and Lippert joined her but this move soon faded as Persico countered over the top with Kerbaol inside the final 10km. The hesitation began to hinder the group behind who quickly found themselves 13 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol then kicked away from Persico as the race hit the final ascent of the Salita dei Ronchi (1.9 km at 5.3%), just as Lippert took it upon herself to bridge the gap solo knowing the win was disappearing up the road.</p>\n<p>The Frenchwoman eked out her lead on the ride up to Varese, eventually crossing the line with her arms aloft 20 seconds ahead of Persico and Lippert who rounded out the podium positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13689&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13689&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Kerbaol then held off the chase from Liane Lippert (Movistar) and Persico.</p>\n<p>It was a brutal day of racing in Northern Italy as adverse weather conditions sparked two shortenings of the original 136.3km route. The rain-soaked and fragmented peloton came home in small groups behind Kerbaol.</p>\n<p>Having won a stage of the Tour de France Femmes thanks to her expert downhill and time-trialling abilities earlier in the season, Kerbaol showed off the same skills as she navigated the slippery roads, before launching to an eighth career win.</p>\n<p>Persico sat on defending champion Lippert&#8217;s wheel after the German bridged across to her out of the group behind and tried to pull back Kerbaol unsuccessfully, before outsprinting her to second place 20 seconds after the Frenchwoman crossed the line.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe action kicked off in the fourth Tre Valli Varesine women&#8217;s race even before the flag dropped, with an early circuit in Busto Arsizio and two of the 15.8km final circuit laps to be removed due to heavy rain.</p>\n<p>Despite the brutal conditions, several moves tried to get away on the wet roads, the strongest of which included defending champion Lippert. The day&#8217;s main breakaway formed with 75 km to go, with Mareille Meijering (Movistar), Flora Perkins (Fenix-Deceuninck), Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health), Francesca Barale (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), Persico, Joscelin Lowden (Uno-X Mobility) and Monica Trinca Colonel (Bepink-Bongioanni) going clear.</p>\n<p>As another lap was taken out of the racing in the worsening conditions, the break&#8217;s gap extended out past the minute mark 35 km from the finish, with Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (Liv AlUla Jayco) doing much of the pulling in the heavily reduced chase group.</p>\n<p>Meijering was the first rider in the break to bite in the final two laps, attacking her fellow escapees, however, she quickly knocked off her effort and began sitting at the back. This seemed like an instruction as 10km later, the break had been caught and Lippert was one of several riders to bridge the gap.</p>\n<p>On the climb up to Varese before the final lap, more attacks followed, first through French champion Juliette Labous (DSM-Firmenich PostNL). Then former junior world champion Julie Bego (Cofidis) attacked alone on the key Montello (2 km at 5.2%) climb.</p>\n<p>Labous and Lippert joined her but this move soon faded as Persico countered over the top with Kerbaol inside the final 10km. The hesitation began to hinder the group behind who quickly found themselves 13 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol then kicked away from Persico as the race hit the final ascent of the Salita dei Ronchi (1.9 km at 5.3%), just as Lippert took it upon herself to bridge the gap solo knowing the win was disappearing up the road.</p>\n<p>The Frenchwoman eked out her lead on the ride up to Varese, eventually crossing the line with her arms aloft 20 seconds ahead of Persico and Lippert who rounded out the podium positions.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13689&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13689&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

From 2005 to 2019, the race was organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour, before joining the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Stan Van Tricht (Alpecin Deceuninck) won the Coppa Bernocchi one-day race in northern Italy after being part of the 155km breakaway.</p>\n<p>The 25-year-old Belgian was still strong when other riders joined the attack and then played the finale perfectly to take his first career victory.</p>\n<p>Bart Lemmen (Visma-Lease a Bike), who was also one of the first riders to attack, was caught with just a kilometre to go. Late attacker Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates) was closed down and then Van Tricht closed the gap on Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) to stay on the front and win.</p>\n<p>Alex Baudin (Decathlon AG2R) was second and Roger Adri√† (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was third. Powless was fourth.</p>\n<p>Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) tried to cross to the attack with 80 km to go but was chased down by Primo≈æ Rogliƒç&#8217;s Red Bill-Bora-Hansgrohe teammates. He and the other big-name riders finished in the peloton at 1:27, perhaps thinking about Tuesday&#8217;s Tre Valli Varesine, when they face Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates).</p>\n<p>Van Tricht has still to ride a Grand Tour after two seasons with Soudal Quick-Step and this year at Alpecin Deceuninck but clearly has the speed and tactical experience for one-day races.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a difficult season but I know I&#8217;d found the legs in the last few weeks. Then today I rode a perfect race by being in the breakaway. At the end, I had to be smart, make sure I stayed with the group and then go for the sprint,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was in the front because there were strong teams attacking. It was a strong break and we could ride away and we knew we could go far, especially with the rain, which makes it better for the breakaway.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew that I perhaps had the best sprint in the group but it&#8217;s difficult with the guys coming from behind. I had a good wheel on Roger Adri√† and then I saw Powless go and I knew I had to react immediately.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Coppa Bernocchi is the second race of the &#8216;Trittico Lombardo&#8217; series that ends with Tuesday&#8217;s Tre Valli Varesine. The best rider of the three races traditionally wins a diamond as a special prize.</p>\n<p>The 105th edition of the Coppa Bernocchi started in Legnano with a ride north and then seven laps of the Valle Olona circuit before a fast ride back to the finish in Legnano.</p>\n<p>The attacks came as soon as the race director&#8217;s car accelerated away. Lemmen was one of the first riders to attack and was part of the first real break after 15km. Van Tricht was also hunting for an opportunity, as were  Anthony Perez (Cofidis), Pierre Latour (Total Energies) and Alessandro Pinarello (VF Bardiani Csf Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>The peloton let them go and the five opened a five-minute gap as they began the seven laps of the Valle Olona circuit to the east of Milan Malpensa airport. The 17km circuit included the Piccolo Stelvio and Caramamma climbs, with the local crowds gathering on the hairpins of the Piccolo Stelvio.</p>\n<p>During the fourth climb of Piccolo Stelvio, with 80 km to race, Evenepoel made a surprise attack to try to cross to the breakaway after his Soudal Quick-Step teammates massed on the front and split the peloton.</p>\n<p>Mauri Vansevenant managed to go with him and Marc Hirschi and Pavel Sivakov joined (UAE Team Emirates) them. Their gap to the break was down to 2:40 at the summit of the Piccolo Stelvio, with the peloton at 3:00.</p>\n<p>However, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe missed the move and so chased at speed. When the big-name quartet was caught, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe sent Adri√† in a counter-attack and Sivakov, Baudin and Powless joined him.</p>\n<p>On the last climb of the Piccolo Stelvio, Lemmen attacked alone, opening a gap on the survivors of the break, with Adri√†, Sivakov, Baudin and Powless at 55 seconds.</p>\n<p>The chasers eventually came together with 27 km to race, creating a chase of six, with Pinarello and Van Tricht surviving the high-speed surges by Adri√†, Sivakov, Baudin and Powless. The peloton was at almost two minutes and so with no chance of victory.</p>\n<p>Lemmen used his time-trialling prowess to hold off the well-organised chase. The gap was just 20 seconds with 15km to go and 13 seconds with five kilometres to go but Lemmen refused to give up and briefly seemed to have a chance of victory.</p>\n<p>The rising road to the last kilometre proved too much for Lemmen and he was caught as they turned a corner under the flamme rouge. Sivakov tried a late attack but was soon pulled back. Then Powless tried his hand inside the final five hundred metres.</p>\n<p>The American got a gap but Van Tricht took a risk, chased him down and then powered on to lead out the sprint. Nobody could match his speed so Van Tricht celebrated his well-deserved first professional victory in Legnano.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=196&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=196&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is known as a &#8220;Sprinters&#8217; Classic&#8221; because it frequently ends in a bunch sprint at the finish, in Tours. For several decades the race arrived on the 2.7 km long Avenue de Grammont, one of cycling&#8217;s best-known finishing straits, particularly renowned among sprinters.

Their advantage swelled to as much as five minutes but was shaved down as the riders approached the ten gravel sectors &#8211; vineyard paths &#8211; in the final 70km. </p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) attacked as the first chemin de vigne approached, briefly followed by Pascal Ackermann (Israel-PremierTech), and went solo as he hit the first of the supposed ‚Äòwhite roads‚Äô at Limeray ‚Äì more of a slick, muddy brown in the inhospitable weather. </p>\n<p>The Dane caught the breakaway with 56km to race and immediately swung onto the front, but his efforts were stymied by his new companions‚Äô refusal to cooperate. Boulet and Retegi were distanced on the Grosse Pierre gravel sector but Affini continued to sit on Pedersen‚Äôs wheel, with the Dane holding their gap steady at around 35 seconds.</p>\n<p>Laporte attacked with 33km to go, taking Vacek with him, and Affini finally took a turn in support of his teammate. But the Italian was dropped on the C√¥te de la Roch√®re, absorbed by the bunch, and soon spat out the back of the peloton too. </p>\n<p>A visibly tired Pedersen was reeled in on the penultimate gravel sector but the peloton‚Äôs march was slowed by Visma-Lease a Bike and Lidl-Trek hanging back, and the leading duo held the gap at around half a minute.</p>\n<p>Lotto-Dstny led the chase for Arnaud de Lie but as the kilometres ticked by it became clear the gap was unassailable: this was a two-man shootout for glory in Tours. Laporte and Vacek had time to try to psych each other out on the Avenue de Grammont before the Frenchman launched his sprint; Vacek couldn‚Äôt match his kick and Laporte had time to celebrate as he crossed the line. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=28&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=28&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I am happy that the organisers took up my suggestion to make it more challenging. Putting a climb in the middle was impossible, so the double climb of San Luca was a winning choice.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini, who is moving to UAE Team ADQ next season, said she ‚Äúparticularly wanted to win‚Äù as she said goodbye to her team of six years and head director Ina-Yoko Teutenberg.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThese [today and then the Simac Tour] are my last days with Lidl-Trek. Today, was the last race with Ina in the team car. I want to close this chapter in the best possible way. And then, there was also Luca [Guercilena] with us at the race.

Created in 2022, it is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s International Calendar, in class 1.1.</p>\n<p>British super-talent Cat Ferguson continued her stunning run of form with victory at Binche-Chimay-Binche pour Dames, taking her second win as a professional and first since becoming junior time trial and road race world champion in Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>Ferguson, 18, who is still riding as a stagiaire in just her fourth race for Movistar, was led out perfectly by Emma Norsgaard who kept the pace high in the final until her young teammate launched.</p>\n<p>The Brit quickly distanced Charlotte Kool after the top sprinter suffered a late mechanical and easily sprinted to the victory ahead of Christina Schweinberger (Fenix-Deceuninck) and Anniina Ahtosalo (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible, I&#8217;m here just to learn, I&#8217;m still a junior, I&#8217;m still a stagiaire and this is totally not what I expected at the front of the race so it&#8217;s really surreal,&#8221; said Ferguson post-race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so grateful to the girls because I&#8217;m new and they are so welcoming and accommodating and they help me so much to learn. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope to just continue how I&#8217;m doing now &#8211; if I can keep on the progression that I&#8217;m going on at the minute then I think I can achieve great things but the next three years are just about adapting to the new category and learning from the girls around me.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 117km race from Chimay to Binche was all about the closing circuit in Binche, which featured two short cobbled sectors tackled three times apiece plus a 3.2km, 2.3% hill, tackled twice.</p>\n<p>Several breakaway attempts were made during the opening 70km, including a solo move from Karolina Perekitko (Winspace). The Polish racer was brought back with 50km still to run, however.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility controlled the pace at the head of the peloton on the way towards the closing circuits before Jeanne Korevaar (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) put in the first major attack. </p>\n<p>She was soon caught and passed by Victoire Berteau (Cofidis) and Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels), with the pair pushing on alone and racing into the final kilometres. With 2km to go, only 10 seconds separated them and the peloton, and it was DSM-Firmenich PostNL who brought them back for good just inside the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Movistar were next to take over the pacemaking, with Ferguson lying behind Emma Norsgaard in the lead-out train. DSM&#8217;s Charlotte Kool was also in prime position for the sprint, though a slip from the pedals at an inopportune moment saw her chances in the sprint all but disappear.</p>\n<p>Ferguson took advantage of the situation and hit the front, holding off charges from Schweinberger and Ahtosalo to secure the win as Kool finished a place back in fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>The 2024 UCI Road World Championships witnessed history in the making on Sunday as Tadej Pogaƒçar became the first rider in 37 years to follow up this season&#8217;s victories in the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Tour de France with a gold medal and the rainbow jersey in the elite men&#8217;s road race.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian claimed cycling&#8217;s Triple Crown in devastating style, breaking away from the main peloton with 100 kilometres to go, blasting through a 16-rider move then going solo some 50 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked briefly to be in trouble as his gap dipped below 40 seconds on the final lap, but he still remained clear for Slovenia&#8217;s first ever road race gold medal, his 23rd win of the 2024 season, and another giant step towards becoming a legend of the sport.</p>\n<p>The silver medal went to late attacker Ben O&#8217;Connor (Australia), crossing the line 31 seconds behind, with defending champion Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) then claiming the bronze.</p>\n<p>But in one of the most stunning World Championships rides in the race&#8217;s history, the day in cycling, the year and perhaps even the decade all belonged to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe what just happened, after this kind of season, I put a lot of pressure on myself for today. I had pressure from myself, from the team, we came here for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race unfolded pretty quick and there was a dangerous break in the front, I maybe did a stupid attack, luckily Jan [Tratnik] was there with me and I never gave up until the final. It&#8217;s an incredible day, I can&#8217;t believe what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar confirmed that his attack at 100 kilometres to go, an enormous distance even by the Slovenian&#8217;s standards, had not been planned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course,it was not planned. We had planned to keep race under control but the race went quite early and I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking and I just went also, I went with the flow and luckily I made it, but it was so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure I wanted this title, after many years fighting for the Tour de France and other races, I never had a World Championships as a pure goal, and this year everything went smoothly already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a perfect season, this was a big goal to win the World Championships and I can&#8217;t believe it happened, I have to thank the whole team, without them it would not have been possible and I&#8217;m super proud of the national team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nJust as in the elite women&#8217;s equivalent event, at the start in Winterthur a minute&#8217;s silence was held in memory of Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died from injuries incurred in a crash in Thursday&#8217;s race. Once again, too, the Swiss team stood at the front of the bunch during the brief but moving ceremony. Then the flag dropped and after a thankfully short neutralized section on the typically drawn-out Worlds course, racing on a dry, cool day got underway.</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 kilometres, when it came to the early break nothing seemed to be sticking. But at last a concerted effort went clear with local hero Silvan Dillier (Switzerland), Luc Wirtgen (Luxembourg), and Piotr Pekala (Poland) receiving further valuable reinforcements in the shape of former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Norway), Rui Oliveira (Portugal), Simon Geschke (Germany), Markus Pajur (Estonia) and Roberto Carlos Gonzalez (Panama). Pajur and Gonzalez started struggling almost immediately, but more than enough firepower and variety in talent remained amongst the half-dozen breakaways to handle the dauntingly difficult terrain that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>In a largely uneventful opening segment, a small crash for Pello Bilbao (Spain) into a farmyard fence saw the veteran outsider in some pain but able to continue. However, the same was not true of Julian Alaphilippe, whose hopes of a record-equalling third rainbow jersey ended prematurely when the Frenchman fell and had to quit even before the race had reached the finishing circuit around Zurich.</p>\n<p>Then for over an hour a holding pattern emerged, with Victor Campenaerts and Jan Tratnik, working for Belgium and Slovenia respectively, keeping the half-dozen ahead under control at around four minutes. There was no sign of the Netherlands though, despite their fielding the third big favourite of the day, defending champion Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>Finally Pablo Castrillo, the recent double Vuelta a a Espa√±a stage winner, made the first attack from the quiescent pack on the seven laps of the Zurich circuit. Castrillo rapidly self-combusted, but his brief dig contrasted sharply with the much more insistent drive that followed by ten other dangerously strong riders and nations: Jay Vine (Australia), Laurens De Plus (Belgium), Stevie Williams (GB), Kevin Vermaerke (USA), Magnus Cort (Denmark), Matteo Cattaneo (Italy), Johannes Staune-Mittet (Norway), Florian Lipowitz (Germany) Pavel Sivakov (France) and Slovenia&#8217;s Tratnik.</p>\n<p>Logically enough given their leaders and two top favourites were still safely in the peloton, neither Slovenia nor Belgium were prepared to work in the break. The key question was, perhaps, who would be willing to spearhead the pursuit in the bunch behind &#8211; and the initial answer was &#8216;nobody&#8217;, allowing the 10 counter-attackers rapidly to carve open a promising gap of over three minutes.</p>\n<p> The &#8216;who&#8217;ll blink first&#8217; strategy continued in the pack far longer than expected, and with four 26.9-kilometre laps to go, the two breaks fused, creating a lead 16-man group. A concerted, if belated, response by Denmark, Spain and the USA in the peloton dampened feelings amongst some TV commentators that the winner was now bound to be coming from the front group. Then when Slovenia also opted to chase with Domen Novak behind despite having Tratnik ahead, it was clear that something much more serious was still brewing in the pack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the attack</strong><br />\nAnd so what proved to be the race&#8217;s defining moment suddenly hove into view. Pogaƒçar himself opted to make a move, blasting up the right side of a draggy climb at the jaw-dropping distance of just over 100 kilometres to go. Andrea Bagioli (Italy) was the only one to briefly follow him as Pogaƒçar yelled at Slovenian roadside team staff to tell him the gap on his chasers. But by the time Tratnik dropped back to tow the Slovenian up to the break, the Italian was long out of the duo&#8217;s rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Conventional thinking suggested Pogaƒçar&#8217;s audacious move was too early, even with memories of his 81-kilometre charge away at Strade Bianche and numerous other long-distance attacks to justify it. Certainly no-one could possibly have anticipated such a bid for victory, made at a moment when none of the favourites had even begun to start to think about attacking. But as has been proved time and again by Pogaƒçar in bike races, conventional thinking just does not apply to the Slovenian&#8217;s way of racing, and at the 2024 Worlds he was to prove that to a game-changing new limit.</p>\n<p>Reckless or not, Belgium were understandably extremely troubled by the Slovenian&#8217;s disappearance up the road, driving hard in the bunch to try and reduce the gap. The Belgians would likely have been even more worried to learn that as soon as Pogaƒçar reached the break ahead with Tratnik as his escort, he then made it clear he meant business by briefly clipping off the front of the race. However, even for a rider as exceptional as the Slovenian, going solo at 90 kilometres from the finish was perhaps too ambitious a move and he eased back into the group of 16 again.</p>\n<p>The gap was hovering at just over a minute at 83 kilometres to go as Tratnik delivered some textbook tactics to a highly unusual race scenario and unsurprisingly rode himself into the ground for his leader. When the 17 powered through the long finishing straight at the start of the third last lap the peloton could see the break ahead. But even the gap of 40 seconds was proving very hard to wear down. Only when the Dutch finally showed their hand did that advantage begin to shrink, just as Pogaƒçar yelled at Tratnik to make another all-out effort &#8211; before blasting off again.</p>\n<p>This time only Pavel Sivakov (France) was able to hold on at first, but even he had to lose Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel on the steepest part of the Zurichbergstrasse. Once across the top, though, the Slovenian wisely opted to wait for Sivakov, knowing that even for a giant of the sport like himself, attacking in a Worlds alone with 77 kilometres to go was the most daunting of tasks. The pressure of his repeated attacks, though, was such that in the peloton the </p>\n<p>Belgian team was at the risk of blowing up, with Evenepoel down to just one rider, Maxim van Gils and the Netherlands only chasing with Bauke Mollema. And so the two-hour, almost completely futile, history of trying to chase down a Pogaƒçar on the rampage began, with first Evenepoel hitting the panic button twice in person in quick succession. </p>\n<p>His double move had little effect apart from reducing the chase group to 35 riders, but Pogaƒçar, meanwhile, was steadily maintaining a gap of 45 seconds. That small gap might have been bigger, but the Slovenian&#8217;s constant glances behind meant he knew that fellow breakaway Sivakov could provide some more valuable support for a little longer &#8211; and, equally, that his long-term plan of keeping his pursuers at bay was working out just fine.</p>\n<p>It was not as if the chasers were giving up the ghost completely. Van der Poel put in one acceleration after another and then Evenepoel himself, too, pushed hard on the downhill to try and keep his Worlds hope alight. However, the most promising chase group turned out to be formed by Ben Healy (Ireland), Toms Skujins (Latvia) and Oscar Onley (GB), reducing Pogaƒçar and Sivakov&#8217;s advantage to 40 seconds, with Van der Poel and a visibly frustrated Evenepoel trailing along some 20 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was still arguably too narrow for comfort, though, and certainly not enough for Pogaƒçar to count on much-needed support from a team car. And so it was that with 50.5 kilometres to go when Pogaƒçar simply maintained his pace on the steepest climb of all, the Zurichbergstrasse for Sivakov the pace set down by his trade teammate was just too much, and the longest winning solo breakaway in the World Championships since 1971 began. Yet again &#8211; just like in Strade Bianche, just like in Li√®ge, and just like in the Giro and Tour &#8211; Pogaƒçar was out front alone and in a class of his own.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was brave enough to try at one point to make a lone counter-attack, catching a flagging Onley, while Skujins and Healy were working well together, even sharing bottles in their tenacious pursuit. But while Pogaƒçar still briefly looked concerned and waved an arm after missing one bidon with a gel attached at a feed, even with an hour&#8217;s racing remaining and 220 kilometres in his legs, increasingly it seemed as if he only had himself to beat.</p>\n<p>With 35 kilometres to go, the sense of resignation in the chasers was palpable. Given Pogaƒçar&#8217;s advantage stood at 1:02 as the lap-to-go bell rang out and with no-one showing the remotest sign of putting on a last-minute counter-attack, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s victory felt all but a foregone conclusion. A twist in the tale</p>\n<p>However, there was almost a final twist in the tail of major proportions as on a day with over 4,000 metres of vertical climbing and after a breakaway of historic proportions, even a giant like Pogaƒçar began to struggle slightly on the final lap. There was a second major wobble downwards in his time gap as Marc Hirschi (Switzerland) made a devastating counter-attack and suddenly, just as his triumph had seemed inevitable and for the first time in three hours, Pogaƒçar looked vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Hirschi was joined by Mas, the two then regained contact with Healy and Skujins and their numbers swelled further to Evenepoel, Van der Poel and O&#8217;Connor. Suddenly it was one rider ahead against seven behind and as the gap dropped even further to a nerve-wracking 39 seconds, the Slovenian staff waiting at the finish line began looking increasingly worried Yet for all a fast-recovering Evenepoel continued to chase, on a crucial little kicker on the long last downhill, Pogaƒçar abruptly overcame his tiredness and in a trademark flurry of pedal-turning, opened up his gap to 50 seconds again. </p>\n<p>With that extra time cushion and despite a searing late attack by Skujins and another by Healy, one further factor counted in his favour: behind the hesitations and changes of pace remained a constant, making it much harder for any sustained pursuit. </p>\n<p>So at long last and after one of the most memorable rides in Worlds history, Pogaƒçar could finally celebrate a milestone achievement in the sport, punching the sky in delight as he celebrated his first road race gold medal. Just when it seemed like the Slovenian could not set the bar even higher, he has done so &#8211; and after winning cycling&#8217;s two toughest Grand Tours in a single season, the most arduous, unpredictable, one-day race of them all is now in his palmares as well. ends</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>The 2024 UCI Road World Championships witnessed history in the making on Sunday as Tadej Pogaƒçar became the first rider in 37 years to follow up this season&#8217;s victories in the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Tour de France with a gold medal and the rainbow jersey in the elite men&#8217;s road race.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian claimed cycling&#8217;s Triple Crown in devastating style, breaking away from the main peloton with 100 kilometres to go, blasting through a 16-rider move then going solo some 50 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked briefly to be in trouble as his gap dipped below 40 seconds on the final lap, but he still remained clear for Slovenia&#8217;s first ever road race gold medal, his 23rd win of the 2024 season, and another giant step towards becoming a legend of the sport.</p>\n<p>The silver medal went to late attacker Ben O&#8217;Connor (Australia), crossing the line 31 seconds behind, with defending champion Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) then claiming the bronze.</p>\n<p>But in one of the most stunning World Championships rides in the race&#8217;s history, the day in cycling, the year and perhaps even the decade all belonged to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe what just happened, after this kind of season, I put a lot of pressure on myself for today. I had pressure from myself, from the team, we came here for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race unfolded pretty quick and there was a dangerous break in the front, I maybe did a stupid attack, luckily Jan [Tratnik] was there with me and I never gave up until the final. It&#8217;s an incredible day, I can&#8217;t believe what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar confirmed that his attack at 100 kilometres to go, an enormous distance even by the Slovenian&#8217;s standards, had not been planned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course,it was not planned. We had planned to keep race under control but the race went quite early and I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking and I just went also, I went with the flow and luckily I made it, but it was so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure I wanted this title, after many years fighting for the Tour de France and other races, I never had a World Championships as a pure goal, and this year everything went smoothly already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a perfect season, this was a big goal to win the World Championships and I can&#8217;t believe it happened, I have to thank the whole team, without them it would not have been possible and I&#8217;m super proud of the national team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nJust as in the elite women&#8217;s equivalent event, at the start in Winterthur a minute&#8217;s silence was held in memory of Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died from injuries incurred in a crash in Thursday&#8217;s race. Once again, too, the Swiss team stood at the front of the bunch during the brief but moving ceremony. Then the flag dropped and after a thankfully short neutralized section on the typically drawn-out Worlds course, racing on a dry, cool day got underway.</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 kilometres, when it came to the early break nothing seemed to be sticking. But at last a concerted effort went clear with local hero Silvan Dillier (Switzerland), Luc Wirtgen (Luxembourg), and Piotr Pekala (Poland) receiving further valuable reinforcements in the shape of former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Norway), Rui Oliveira (Portugal), Simon Geschke (Germany), Markus Pajur (Estonia) and Roberto Carlos Gonzalez (Panama). Pajur and Gonzalez started struggling almost immediately, but more than enough firepower and variety in talent remained amongst the half-dozen breakaways to handle the dauntingly difficult terrain that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>In a largely uneventful opening segment, a small crash for Pello Bilbao (Spain) into a farmyard fence saw the veteran outsider in some pain but able to continue. However, the same was not true of Julian Alaphilippe, whose hopes of a record-equalling third rainbow jersey ended prematurely when the Frenchman fell and had to quit even before the race had reached the finishing circuit around Zurich.</p>\n<p>Then for over an hour a holding pattern emerged, with Victor Campenaerts and Jan Tratnik, working for Belgium and Slovenia respectively, keeping the half-dozen ahead under control at around four minutes. There was no sign of the Netherlands though, despite their fielding the third big favourite of the day, defending champion Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>Finally Pablo Castrillo, the recent double Vuelta a a Espa√±a stage winner, made the first attack from the quiescent pack on the seven laps of the Zurich circuit. Castrillo rapidly self-combusted, but his brief dig contrasted sharply with the much more insistent drive that followed by ten other dangerously strong riders and nations: Jay Vine (Australia), Laurens De Plus (Belgium), Stevie Williams (GB), Kevin Vermaerke (USA), Magnus Cort (Denmark), Matteo Cattaneo (Italy), Johannes Staune-Mittet (Norway), Florian Lipowitz (Germany) Pavel Sivakov (France) and Slovenia&#8217;s Tratnik.</p>\n<p>Logically enough given their leaders and two top favourites were still safely in the peloton, neither Slovenia nor Belgium were prepared to work in the break. The key question was, perhaps, who would be willing to spearhead the pursuit in the bunch behind &#8211; and the initial answer was &#8216;nobody&#8217;, allowing the 10 counter-attackers rapidly to carve open a promising gap of over three minutes.</p>\n<p> The &#8216;who&#8217;ll blink first&#8217; strategy continued in the pack far longer than expected, and with four 26.9-kilometre laps to go, the two breaks fused, creating a lead 16-man group. A concerted, if belated, response by Denmark, Spain and the USA in the peloton dampened feelings amongst some TV commentators that the winner was now bound to be coming from the front group. Then when Slovenia also opted to chase with Domen Novak behind despite having Tratnik ahead, it was clear that something much more serious was still brewing in the pack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the attack</strong><br />\nAnd so what proved to be the race&#8217;s defining moment suddenly hove into view. Pogaƒçar himself opted to make a move, blasting up the right side of a draggy climb at the jaw-dropping distance of just over 100 kilometres to go. Andrea Bagioli (Italy) was the only one to briefly follow him as Pogaƒçar yelled at Slovenian roadside team staff to tell him the gap on his chasers. But by the time Tratnik dropped back to tow the Slovenian up to the break, the Italian was long out of the duo&#8217;s rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Conventional thinking suggested Pogaƒçar&#8217;s audacious move was too early, even with memories of his 81-kilometre charge away at Strade Bianche and numerous other long-distance attacks to justify it. Certainly no-one could possibly have anticipated such a bid for victory, made at a moment when none of the favourites had even begun to start to think about attacking. But as has been proved time and again by Pogaƒçar in bike races, conventional thinking just does not apply to the Slovenian&#8217;s way of racing, and at the 2024 Worlds he was to prove that to a game-changing new limit.</p>\n<p>Reckless or not, Belgium were understandably extremely troubled by the Slovenian&#8217;s disappearance up the road, driving hard in the bunch to try and reduce the gap. The Belgians would likely have been even more worried to learn that as soon as Pogaƒçar reached the break ahead with Tratnik as his escort, he then made it clear he meant business by briefly clipping off the front of the race. However, even for a rider as exceptional as the Slovenian, going solo at 90 kilometres from the finish was perhaps too ambitious a move and he eased back into the group of 16 again.</p>\n<p>The gap was hovering at just over a minute at 83 kilometres to go as Tratnik delivered some textbook tactics to a highly unusual race scenario and unsurprisingly rode himself into the ground for his leader. When the 17 powered through the long finishing straight at the start of the third last lap the peloton could see the break ahead. But even the gap of 40 seconds was proving very hard to wear down. Only when the Dutch finally showed their hand did that advantage begin to shrink, just as Pogaƒçar yelled at Tratnik to make another all-out effort &#8211; before blasting off again.</p>\n<p>This time only Pavel Sivakov (France) was able to hold on at first, but even he had to lose Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel on the steepest part of the Zurichbergstrasse. Once across the top, though, the Slovenian wisely opted to wait for Sivakov, knowing that even for a giant of the sport like himself, attacking in a Worlds alone with 77 kilometres to go was the most daunting of tasks. The pressure of his repeated attacks, though, was such that in the peloton the </p>\n<p>Belgian team was at the risk of blowing up, with Evenepoel down to just one rider, Maxim van Gils and the Netherlands only chasing with Bauke Mollema. And so the two-hour, almost completely futile, history of trying to chase down a Pogaƒçar on the rampage began, with first Evenepoel hitting the panic button twice in person in quick succession. </p>\n<p>His double move had little effect apart from reducing the chase group to 35 riders, but Pogaƒçar, meanwhile, was steadily maintaining a gap of 45 seconds.

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (Belgium) has successfully defended her 2023 rainbow jersey in the elite women&#8217;s road race at the World Championships in Zurich.</p>\n<p>Silver in a ferocious six-rider final bunch that decided the 154-kilometre race was Chlo√© Dygert (USA), with Italy&#8217;s Elisa Longo Borghini clinching the bronze. Puck Pieterse (Netherlands) claimed the under-23 women&#8217;s world title, finishing 13th from a chasing group at 3:00.</p>\n<p>Raced in atrocious weather conditions, the rain-soaked and demanding Championship was dominated by the Netherlands, with Demi Vollering driving a lead group clear on the final two climbs.</p>\n<p>But despite being in trouble earlier on, Kopecky maintained her calm and, having shadowed Vollering in the finale, remained firmly in contention.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini led out the six-strong sprint for gold, only for Kopecky to come through to become the first rider to claim back-to-back elite women&#8217;s World Championships titles since Marianne Vos in 2012-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kind of disbelief, but first of all I want to pay my condolences to the family of Muriel,&#8221; Kopecky said afterwards, referring to Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died as a result of her injuries incurred in Thursday&#8217;s road race &#8211; and to whom she dedicated her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the minute of silence at the start, seeing the Swiss riders crying, is something you just don&#8217;t want to see. I think it&#8217;s a very hard moment for them as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for the race itself, the defending champion said &#8220;It&#8217;s for sure a win [I took] with my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a really annoying day because it was raining and it wasn&#8217;t warm, but on the climbs it was warm and then in the downhill you got so cold and I was freezing at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But then I tried to stay as calm as possible, on the steeper climb I didn&#8217;t have any troubles and then on the longer one in the final time when Demi went I had some difficulties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I just tried to stay at my own pace and come back and in the end it was just a lot of mind games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then it was just trying to stay as cool as possible and use my energy in the right moment. The Australian rider [Ruby Roseman-Gannon] came from the back, Demi reacted immediately and that was perfect for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe tragic loss of Furrer has left &#8211; and will leave &#8211;  an indelible mark on these World Championships and as Kopecky said, before the race a minute&#8217;s silence was held to honour the memory of the 18-year-old, with the Swiss team assembled at the front of the peloton underneath the starting gantry. </p>\n<p>Swiss rider Noemi Ruegg surely echoed the thoughts of many when she told Eurosport before the race, &#8220;We worked hard for this, we are trying to do our best and we will race with Muriel in our hearts and we will see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the flag dropped, a three-rider attack quickly formed in the incessant rain, containing Caroline Baur (Switzerland), Sara Martin (Spain) and Nina Berton (Luxembourg). Coming through the finish on the first of four 26.8-kilometre laps, the trio held an advantage of 30 seconds over a lead group already reduced to around half of the 198 starters. Baur and Martin both struggled on the toughest ramps of the painfully irregular Bergstrasse that almost immediately followed, though, leaving Berton ploughing a lone pathway ahead, and one which quickly fizzled out.</p>\n<p>The race&#8217;s next significant development came some 100 kilometres from the line thanks to a dangerous nine-strong move, sparked by Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) and Niamh Fisher-Black (New Zealand) with Sara Gigante (Australia), Soraya Paladin (Italy), Urska Zigart (Slovenia), Justine Ghekiere (Belgium), Elena Hartmann (Switzerland), Christine Majerus (Luxembourg) and Mie Bjorndal Ottestad (Norway) all following. Then when Franziska Koch (Germany) and Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands) bridged across, with so many top nations present, the move looked even more promising. But the grim reality was the absence of France, Spain and Poland meant it was hard for the 11 to gain any traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, a concerted pursuit by the Netherlands both reabsorbed the break and saw 2021 World Champion Elisa Balsamo squeezed out the back. Another stand-out name, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (France), was also already struggling. The key lesson from this early skirmishing, either way, was that the Dutch were planning to make the running, be it in creating breakaways or ruthlessly crushing them.</p>\n<p>As the rain teemed down relentlessly, the all-powerful Dutch &#8211; still with all seven riders present on the front at the halfway point &#8211;  continued to use their strength in depth to play the numbers game in support of leader Vollering. Mischa Bredewold was merciless when it came to squeezing down the bunch in the brutal conditions to 50 riders, three-times road rainbow jersey Marianne Vos and Riejanne Markus then took over and next Pauliena Rooijakkers continued to pile on the pain.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to matter when top Dutch names like Vos were showing signs of being in trouble, Vollering herself upped the pace on the second last lap of the race, and her relentless rhythm fleetingly reduced the front group to around a dozen.  Even when Vollering was not closing down attacks in person, her teammates Markus and Pieterse seemed permanently poised to close down any other moves. Nobody, it seemed, could escape the orange team&#8217;s clutches.</p>\n<p><strong>Change of tactics</strong><br />\nThe Dutch seemingly switched from their clampdown tactics, though, when Markus bolted away with only Tour de France mountains classification winner Justine Ghekiere (Belgium) in her wake. In theory, this would force the remaining contenders to chase. In practice, though, a ferocious and somewhat inexplicable acceleration by Vos, then Bredevold and Pieterse reduced their teammate Markus&#8217; and Gheikiere&#8217;s advantage to 25 seconds. </p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (Switzerland) then took over on a long, rain-soaked descent, allowing the seemingly indefatigable Vos to bridge across the much-reduced gap alongside Ruby Roseman-Gannon (Australia). Vos and Markus did take turns from thereon as they powered towards the finish line for a second last time, once again putting their rivals&#8217; ability to respond under severe scrutiny, as Vollering watched and waited. But would a gap of four riders of nearly a minute as the lap-to-go bell rang out prove to be enough?</p>\n<p>The answer came quickly enough as Markus continued to drive for Vos on the steeper segments of the Bergstrasse, while Vollering controlled the chasers all the way through to the fast drop down to the second main climb of the Wetzikon. Finally, a powerful acceleration by Liane Lippert (Germany) singlehandedly reduced the gap to a bridgable 35 seconds and five riders moved ahead: Kopecky, Chlo√© Dygert (USA), Kopecky, Longo Borghini, Vollering and Lippert herself.</p>\n<p>Having flown under the radar for so long, Longo Borghini then made a ferociously long acceleration, only for Vollering to reply. Kopecky, though could not answer and was left trailing to the point where it seemed like her options on a second World Championships title were completely lost.</p>\n<p>As Kopecky found a second wind, Vollering opened up the throttle in earnest, but her determination was quickly matched by Longo Borghini, with Roseman-Gannon emphatically shaking her head as she was invited to come through.  Meanwhile, a colossal effort by Chlo√© Dygert allowed her to regain contact at 14 kilometres to go as the small lead group ploughed through a flooded segment of road. Then in a race with multiple plot changes, a revived Kopecky also recovered enough to regain contact alongside Vos and Markus, making the Dutch the majority once again in a nine-rider group, but with their key rival present, too.</p>\n<p>On the second last climb of the day, a vicious little kicker 10 kilometres, anybody without a sprint in their legs simply had to make a move and Vollering ripped away at the highest speed possible. However, her move simply eliminated her teammates and Ghekiere and reduced the front group to six, while Kopecky&#8217;s turn of speed on the descent ensured that it stayed that way. </p>\n<p>A final drag before the three-kilometre flat run-in alongside Lake Zurich briefly pushed Roseman-Gannon and Dygert out of the running and Longo Borghini did her utmost with a sustained late attack to ensure she kept the group at four. However, Vollering&#8217;s driving response tilted the battle back in favour of the chasers again, and then the last-minute arrival of Dygert and Roseman-Gannon, almost in the final kilometre, made it six riders in search of three medals. </p>\n<p>Perhaps knowing she was the weakest in a sprint, Roseman-Gannon began the charge for the line, only for Vollering to storm past. After her uneven race, though, a veteran track expert like Kopecky was now in her element on the flat finale, and she blasted through the centre of the tiny pack of riders to reclaim her rainbow jersey once again.</p>\n<p>While Kopecky made it clear that she had raced as much with her head as her legs on a difficult and uneven day, the USA also had considerable reason to celebrate, claiming their first silver medal in the event since Inga Thompson in 1991. After all their efforts, the Dutch, on the other hand, suffered a notable defeat with Vollering in fifth, even if gold for Puck Pieterse in the U23 category in the same event subsequently provided a significant consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (Belgium) has successfully defended her 2023 rainbow jersey in the elite women&#8217;s road race at the World Championships in Zurich.</p>\n<p>Silver in a ferocious six-rider final bunch that decided the 154-kilometre race was Chlo√© Dygert (USA), with Italy&#8217;s Elisa Longo Borghini clinching the bronze. Puck Pieterse (Netherlands) claimed the under-23 women&#8217;s world title, finishing 13th from a chasing group at 3:00.</p>\n<p>Raced in atrocious weather conditions, the rain-soaked and demanding Championship was dominated by the Netherlands, with Demi Vollering driving a lead group clear on the final two climbs.</p>\n<p>But despite being in trouble earlier on, Kopecky maintained her calm and, having shadowed Vollering in the finale, remained firmly in contention.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini led out the six-strong sprint for gold, only for Kopecky to come through to become the first rider to claim back-to-back elite women&#8217;s World Championships titles since Marianne Vos in 2012-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kind of disbelief, but first of all I want to pay my condolences to the family of Muriel,&#8221; Kopecky said afterwards, referring to Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died as a result of her injuries incurred in Thursday&#8217;s road race &#8211; and to whom she dedicated her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the minute of silence at the start, seeing the Swiss riders crying, is something you just don&#8217;t want to see. I think it&#8217;s a very hard moment for them as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for the race itself, the defending champion said &#8220;It&#8217;s for sure a win [I took] with my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a really annoying day because it was raining and it wasn&#8217;t warm, but on the climbs it was warm and then in the downhill you got so cold and I was freezing at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But then I tried to stay as calm as possible, on the steeper climb I didn&#8217;t have any troubles and then on the longer one in the final time when Demi went I had some difficulties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I just tried to stay at my own pace and come back and in the end it was just a lot of mind games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then it was just trying to stay as cool as possible and use my energy in the right moment. The Australian rider [Ruby Roseman-Gannon] came from the back, Demi reacted immediately and that was perfect for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe tragic loss of Furrer has left &#8211; and will leave &#8211;  an indelible mark on these World Championships and as Kopecky said, before the race a minute&#8217;s silence was held to honour the memory of the 18-year-old, with the Swiss team assembled at the front of the peloton underneath the starting gantry. </p>\n<p>Swiss rider Noemi Ruegg surely echoed the thoughts of many when she told Eurosport before the race, &#8220;We worked hard for this, we are trying to do our best and we will race with Muriel in our hearts and we will see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the flag dropped, a three-rider attack quickly formed in the incessant rain, containing Caroline Baur (Switzerland), Sara Martin (Spain) and Nina Berton (Luxembourg). Coming through the finish on the first of four 26.8-kilometre laps, the trio held an advantage of 30 seconds over a lead group already reduced to around half of the 198 starters. Baur and Martin both struggled on the toughest ramps of the painfully irregular Bergstrasse that almost immediately followed, though, leaving Berton ploughing a lone pathway ahead, and one which quickly fizzled out.</p>\n<p>The race&#8217;s next significant development came some 100 kilometres from the line thanks to a dangerous nine-strong move, sparked by Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) and Niamh Fisher-Black (New Zealand) with Sara Gigante (Australia), Soraya Paladin (Italy), Urska Zigart (Slovenia), Justine Ghekiere (Belgium), Elena Hartmann (Switzerland), Christine Majerus (Luxembourg) and Mie Bjorndal Ottestad (Norway) all following. Then when Franziska Koch (Germany) and Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands) bridged across, with so many top nations present, the move looked even more promising. But the grim reality was the absence of France, Spain and Poland meant it was hard for the 11 to gain any traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, a concerted pursuit by the Netherlands both reabsorbed the break and saw 2021 World Champion Elisa Balsamo squeezed out the back. Another stand-out name, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (France), was also already struggling. The key lesson from this early skirmishing, either way, was that the Dutch were planning to make the running, be it in creating breakaways or ruthlessly crushing them.</p>\n<p>As the rain teemed down relentlessly, the all-powerful Dutch &#8211; still with all seven riders present on the front at the halfway point &#8211;  continued to use their strength in depth to play the numbers game in support of leader Vollering. Mischa Bredewold was merciless when it came to squeezing down the bunch in the brutal conditions to 50 riders, three-times road rainbow jersey Marianne Vos and Riejanne Markus then took over and next Pauliena Rooijakkers continued to pile on the pain.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to matter when top Dutch names like Vos were showing signs of being in trouble, Vollering herself upped the pace on the second last lap of the race, and her relentless rhythm fleetingly reduced the front group to around a dozen.  Even when Vollering was not closing down attacks in person, her teammates Markus and Pieterse seemed permanently poised to close down any other moves. Nobody, it seemed, could escape the orange team&#8217;s clutches.</p>\n<p><strong>Change of tactics</strong><br />\nThe Dutch seemingly switched from their clampdown tactics, though, when Markus bolted away with only Tour de France mountains classification winner Justine Ghekiere (Belgium) in her wake. In theory, this would force the remaining contenders to chase. In practice, though, a ferocious and somewhat inexplicable acceleration by Vos, then Bredevold and Pieterse reduced their teammate Markus&#8217; and Gheikiere&#8217;s advantage to 25 seconds. </p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (Switzerland) then took over on a long, rain-soaked descent, allowing the seemingly indefatigable Vos to bridge across the much-reduced gap alongside Ruby Roseman-Gannon (Australia). Vos and Markus did take turns from thereon as they powered towards the finish line for a second last time, once again putting their rivals&#8217; ability to respond under severe scrutiny, as Vollering watched and waited. But would a gap of four riders of nearly a minute as the lap-to-go bell rang out prove to be enough?</p>\n<p>The answer came quickly enough as Markus continued to drive for Vos on the steeper segments of the Bergstrasse, while Vollering controlled the chasers all the way through to the fast drop down to the second main climb of the Wetzikon. Finally, a powerful acceleration by Liane Lippert (Germany) singlehandedly reduced the gap to a bridgable 35 seconds and five riders moved ahead: Kopecky, Chlo√© Dygert (USA), Kopecky, Longo Borghini, Vollering and Lippert herself.</p>\n<p>Having flown under the radar for so long, Longo Borghini then made a ferociously long acceleration, only for Vollering to reply. Kopecky, though could not answer and was left trailing to the point where it seemed like her options on a second World Championships title were completely lost.</p>\n<p>As Kopecky found a second wind, Vollering opened up the throttle in earnest, but her determination was quickly matched by Longo Borghini, with Roseman-Gannon emphatically shaking her head as she was invited to come through.  Meanwhile, a colossal effort by Chlo√© Dygert allowed her to regain contact at 14 kilometres to go as the small lead group ploughed through a flooded segment of road. Then in a race with multiple plot changes, a revived Kopecky also recovered enough to regain contact alongside Vos and Markus, making the Dutch the majority once again in a nine-rider group, but with their key rival present, too.</p>\n<p>On the second last climb of the day, a vicious little kicker 10 kilometres, anybody without a sprint in their legs simply had to make a move and Vollering ripped away at the highest speed possible. However, her move simply eliminated her teammates and Ghekiere and reduced the front group to six, while Kopecky&#8217;s turn of speed on the descent ensured that it stayed that way. </p>\n<p>A final drag before the three-kilometre flat run-in alongside Lake Zurich briefly pushed Roseman-Gannon and Dygert out of the running and Longo Borghini did her utmost with a sustained late attack to ensure she kept the group at four. However, Vollering&#8217;s driving response tilted the battle back in favour of the chasers again, and then the last-minute arrival of Dygert and Roseman-Gannon, almost in the final kilometre, made it six riders in search of three medals. </p>\n<p>Perhaps knowing she was the weakest in a sprint, Roseman-Gannon began the charge for the line, only for Vollering to storm past. After her uneven race, though, a veteran track expert like Kopecky was now in her element on the flat finale, and she blasted through the centre of the tiny pack of riders to reclaim her rainbow jersey once again.</p>\n<p>While Kopecky made it clear that she had raced as much with her head as her legs on a difficult and uneven day, the USA also had considerable reason to celebrate, claiming their first silver medal in the event since Inga Thompson in 1991. After all their efforts, the Dutch, on the other hand, suffered a notable defeat with Vollering in fifth, even if gold for Puck Pieterse in the U23 category in the same event subsequently provided a significant consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Niklas Behrens (Germany) scored the rainbow jersey in the U23 men‚Äôs road race the UCI Road World Championships, outpacing Martin Svrƒçek (Slovakia) in a two-man sprint to the line in Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>The pair proved the strongest men from a select chase group behind long-distance solo attacker Jan Christen (Switzerland), who attacked alone 51km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Behind Christen, a group including Behrens, Svrƒçek, Jarno Widar (Belgium), Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) and Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain) formed after an attack from Widar, with the Belgian and his team responsible for much of the pacemaking behind the lone leader.</p>\n<p>On the final lap, Widar was once again leading the way and bringing the chase to within sight of Christen, at which point Behrens launched a powerful uphill attack. His jump at 11km to go brought both him and Svrƒçek across to Christen, with a second jump dispatching the Swiss rider for good.</p>\n<p>Behrens and Svrƒçek were off at the front, distancing the rest and extending their advantage past the 50-second mark before hitting the final kilometres and contesting the gold and silver medals.</p>\n<p>It was Svrƒçek who led out the sprint, with Behrens lurking until the final 150 metres before launching. The German‚Äôs power was too much for his Slovakian rival, netting him the rainbow jersey as U23 world champion.</p>\n<p>Christen, caught by the chase group behind 6km out, would eventually salvage fourth place at 39 seconds down having chased a late attack by Alec Segaert (Belgium). He had bridged across to the chase before quickly attacking solo 2km from the finish to secure the bronze medal, 28 seconds behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>The riders were unaware that 18-year-old Swiss rider Muriel Furrer died from the injuries she sustained in her Thursday crash during the junior women‚Äôs road because the UCI and the Zurich Worlds organising committee made the announcement during their race. </p>\n<p>Before the podium ceremony, a moment of silence was held, while flags were positioned at half mast in Muriel Furrer&#8217;s honour.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 173.6km race set the riders the same challenging circuit that has been contested at the other road races this week, with a 40km flat start giving way to four full laps of a hilly circuit around Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>One climb of Binz (1.5km at 9.3%) and four ascents of Witikon (1.4km at 7.1%) proved the main challenges of the day, though numerous other hills and rises peppered the route, which totalled 2,400 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>Three riders attacked on the flat run to start the race, with Cole Kessler (United States), Lewis Bower (New Zealand) and Robert Donaldson (Great Britain) jumping away to a minute advantage as they entered the hilly finishing circuit for the first time.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Alastair Mackellar (Australia) attempted to bridge across, making a move at 125km out. He was caught in between the leaders and the peloton, however, before dropping back at the 120km mark.</p>\n<p>The three-man break out front wouldn‚Äôt last much longer, either, meaning the race crossed the finish line for the first time, with 108km left to run, with a slimmed-down peloton leading the way.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, on the climb up towards Witikon, Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) launched a stinging attack along with William Junior Lecerf (Belgium), though that would come to nothing. Attempts by Christen, Callum Thornley (Great Britain) and Artem Schmidt (United States) also gained little traction.</p>\n<p>The next time around, with just under 80km left to run, it was the turn of Antonio Morgado (Portugal) and Davide De Pretto (Italy) to try a move. Their unsuccessful break attempt was followed by the likes of Christen, again, as well as Tibor Del Grosso (Netherlands) and Giulio Pellizzari (Italy).</p>\n<p>However, a move wouldn‚Äôt stick until Christen tried for a third time, again on the uphill run to Witikon. At 51km from the finish he managed to get a gap on his rivals, striking out with just under two laps left to run.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the elite chase group that would be chasing him for much of the remainder of the race formed. Belgian riders Segaert and Lecerf had Jarno Widar, Robin Orins and Emiel Verstrynge for company in the group, along with Behrens, Svrƒçek, Del Toro, Pellizzari, Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain), Darren Rafferty (Ireland) and Spanish pair Igor Arrieta and Ivan Romeo.</p>\n<p>Pellizzari decided to venture out alone in the chase as Belgium unsurprisingly controlled the larger group. The Italian was brought back with 33km to go, while the group crossed the finish line to start the final lap 45 seconds behind Christen.</p>\n<p>It was the Belgians who had held the lone leader close by, and it was their man Widar who took the initiative on the final ascent to Witkon with a big move at the front. He took Svrƒçek and Segaert with him, though Del Toro, Blackmore and Del Grosso quickly made it across the gap.</p>\n<p>At the top of the hill, 20km from the line, Segaert and Del Grosso let go, while the work of Belgium and Widar had brought Christen‚Äôs advantage down to just 20 seconds. 18-year-old Widar continued to do much of the work in the chase, dragging the group to within sight of Christen as they raced into the final 15km.</p>\n<p>It was those who had kept more in reserve for the final who made the big moves, though, with Behrens and Svrƒçek powering past and across to Christen‚Äôs wheel 11km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Upon making the catch, Behrens immediately jumped again, distancing Christen as Svrƒçek stuck to his wheel. The pair would continue on to the finish, building their advantage up to almost a minute at one point before slowing in the final kilometre and contesting the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>Behind, Christen was caught by Widar, Blackmore and Del Toro with 6km to run, while a resurgent Segaert chased across and immediately went over the top 2km out. That move, coming after a brief rest in the wheels, was enough to push on secure bronze after the hard work of the Belgian squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Finn (Italy) soloed to the men&#8217;s junior road race world title in grim conditions in Z√ºrich, racing home from 20km out to score his nation‚Äôs first rainbow jersey of the UCI Road World Championships.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) secured the silver medal, crossing the line 2:05 after Finn. He rode solo for the final 13km of the race having dropped fellow chaser H√©ctor √Ålvarez (Spain).</p>\n<p>√Ålvarez, who was going backwards since being left behind by Finn‚Äôs winning move, was caught and passed by a small chase group in the closing kilometres, missing out on bronze in the process.</p>\n<p>Instead, the battle for third came down to a sprint between Senna Remijn (Netherlands), Paul Fietzke (Germany) and Ashlin Barry (United States), with the trio finishing in that order at 3:06 down. √Ålvarez, meanwhile, crossed the line in sixth 3:44 adrift of Finn.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt still hasn‚Äôt sunk in, to be honest. It still feels like a dream,‚Äù Finn said after the finish.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt amazing today, probably the best legs I‚Äôve ever had. When I went on my own the first time with 60km to go I was like ‚ÄòOh, this might be a bit early‚Äô. But then Philipsen and a few other guys bridged to me, and I just wanted to go full on the climb.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAlbert crashed behind me and I hope he‚Äôs OK. But once I was on my own, I knew I had it in the bag because I was feeling amazing.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI usually don‚Äôt like the rain, to be honest. I like 35 and sunny. But today was perfect.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Finn ‚Äì reigning Italian junior road race and time trial champion ‚Äì had been at the head of affairs for 70km of the 127km race, 23km of it alone before he was brought back into an elite lead group 37km out.</p>\n<p>With the pouring rain and the hilly circuit taking their toll on the riders, the group whittled down until just four remained out front to contest the final. Only bad luck would intervene, too, with reigning champion Albert Withen Philipsen (Denmark) crashing out on a soaked corner 22km from home.</p>\n<p>That left Finn and √Ålvarez in the lead, but Finn, who had already spent plenty of energy in a solo move, had yet more left in the tank and dispatched with the Spaniard to race on alone into rainbows.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior men‚Äôs road race would take the peloton on a 127.2km journey from Uster to Z√ºrich, traversing 1,800 metres of climbing along the way. As in the junior women‚Äôs race, the climbs of Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) were the only major obstacles on the route, though the men would have to contend with three ascents of Witikon, taking them through the finish line three times before the crowning of the new world champion.</p>\n<p>The early stage of the race was, unsurprisingly, marked by numerous attacks as those from smaller nations ‚Äì including Azerbaijan ‚Äì attempted to get away. It was also marked by several crashes, including a sizeable one which caught out time trial silver medallist Jasper Schoofs (Belgium).</p>\n<p>The high pace of the start continued for 30km to Binz and past the day‚Äôs opening climb, with no breakaway establishing itself at the front as a result. Already just inside the 90km to go mark, the peloton had been obliterated, leaving only around 20 or so men in front.</p>\n<p>Attacks came and went on the approach to Witikon, including from Lorenzo Finn (Italy), Paul Fietzke (Germany), and H√©ctor √Ålvarez (Spain), leading the peloton to reduce in size once again.</p>\n<p>By this point, with 70km to go, names including time trial world champion Paul Seixas (France), reigning road world champion Albert Within Philipsen (Denmark), Matisse Van Kerckhove (Belgium), Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) ‚Äì plus Finn, Fietzke and √Ålvarez ‚Äì were in the move.</p>\n<p>Withen Philipsen, Seixas and Van Kerckhove all gave it a nudge following the climb to Witikon, though none would get away. Instead, it was Finn who broke clear with an attack 60km out.</p>\n<p>On the way up to Witikon for the second time, Finn had gained 20 seconds, whereas the attacks and counters behind provoked another split. This time, Withen Philipsen, Seixas, Alvarez, Grindley and Senna Remijn (Netherlands) made the cut, leaving the rest of the group behind in pursuit of the lone leader.</p>\n<p>Finn held out well, however, maintaining a 25-second lead over the top of the climb and into the final 45km, while the dropped chasers lagged behind at 1:10. He held out until the 37km mark at least, at which point Withen Philipsen, Grindley and √Ålvarez bridged across having left behind Seixas and Remijn.</p>\n<p>With four in the lead versus two behind, the mathematics of the situation was always going to in favour of the quartet out front. So, it proved as they added second after second to their lead, crossing the finish line for the penultimate time 26km from home with a 35-seconds lead over the chase.</p>\n<p>The situation was quickly becoming even more positive for them, too, as Seixas struggled to keep up with Remijn. That seemed to liberate the Dutchman, if anything, as he swiftly set about closing the gap on the final run to Witikon.</p>\n<p>Now 25 seconds up the road, the lead group was busy blowing apart as Finn led Withen Philipsen then √Ålvarez, then Grindley on the short climb before Witikon. But the Dane‚Äôs race, and a chance at another rainbow jersey, was soon brought to an abrupt end as he crashed out on a wet corner.</p>\n<p>The fall left plenty of what-ifs about the race, and it also left √Ålvarez up with Finn in the lead with Grindley, Remijn and Seixas chasing one-by-one behind. That state of affairs didn‚Äôt last long either, for at the 20km mark Finn was off again, the Italian leaving Alvarez behind in search of victory.</p>\n<p>Finn was on a mission, his advantage swiftly ballooning out past a minute as he hit the 16km mark. √Ålvarez was struggling, and he soon had Grindley for company in a battle for silver.

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Cat Ferguson (Great Britain) added the junior women‚Äôs road race world title to the time trial rainbow jersey she won earlier this week at the UCI Road World Championships, prevailing in a tense three-woman sprint at the end of the 73.5km race in Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old, who turns pro with Movistar next season, outsprinted Paula Ortiz (Spain) and Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àov√°  (Slovakia) inside the final 200 metres after the Spaniard had opened the sprint to draw an end to over a kilometre of poker playing.<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m over the moon. The road race is the thing I&#8217;ve always wanted. Ever since last year, second place really hurt, so to get gold is incredible,&#8221; Ferguson said after the race, referring back to her silver medal in the Glasgow Worlds last summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was conscious that I didn&#8217;t know how big the gap was. I had a good gap of a minute and a half with 5km to go but I knew that we slowed so much because nobody wanted to be on the front. So I kept looking back to check we weren&#8217;t going to get caught.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race is so different [from the time trial and I focus so much on the road. I love the TT bike, but the road is the one I always wanted. It feels even better than Tuesday, which is insane to say because Tuesday was incredible.&#8221;<br />\nThe trio had been all set to contest the medal placings from the 20km to go marker, when they split away from a select lead group on the second and final major climb of the race, the Witikon.</p>\n<p>Clearly the strongest three women on the road, they steadily extended their gap over the chasers as they raced back towards Z√ºrich, sticking together on the soaking roads to the finish and finally enjoying an advantage of well over a minute.</p>\n<p>The final two kilometres brought caginess, checking over shoulders and cat-and-mouse games, but with plenty of time in hand, the trio could afford the slowdown. In the end, though, the final result was no surprise, with Ferguson duly outspeeding her two competitors for her second 2024 World Championships gold.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, having launched the sprint first, but only just hung on to take silver, edging out Chladonova by centimetres at the line. Fourth place was taken by Megan Arens (Netherlands) at just nine seconds down, the 17-year-old having used those final kilometres to close much of the minute-plus gap from the chasers on her own.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior women‚Äôs road race at the Road World Championships would see the peloton tackle a hilly 73.5km course from Uster to Z√ºrich. Two major climbs marked the route ‚Äì Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) ‚Äì while the closing section was run on one-and-a-half laps of a closing circuit around the finish city.<br />\nThe race got underway in damp weather, though the conditions didn‚Äôt prevent riders from going on the attack early on.</p>\n<p>A breakaway wouldn‚Äôt go clear for 16km, however, at which point a group of five raced off the front. Arabella Blackburn (Great Britain) was joined in the lead by Nina Lavenu (France), Italian pair Eleonora La Bella and Silvia Milesi, and Weronika Wasaty (Poland).</p>\n<p>The move was kept on a tight leash by the peloton and the quintet would only last around 10km on the front before being brought back with 47km to run. Not long after that, a new group of attackers made a break for it as eight riders moved clear.<br />\nJunior time trial champion Cat Ferguson (Great Britain) was up there and she was joined by La Bella, her Italian teammate Giada Silo, C√©lia Gery (France), Megan Arens (Netherlands), Ostiz, Kamilla Aaseb√∏ (Norway), and Chlado≈àov√° .</p>\n<p>The group only held a slender lead of the peloton ‚Äì not more than 20 seconds ‚Äì meaning that chasers stood a chance of making it across.</p>\n<p>Imogen Wolff (Great Britain) and Eirini Papadimitriou (Greece) were among those to strike out from the chase, eventually bridging the gap as the race crossed the finish line for the first time at 27km to go.</p>\n<p>Their move made it nine up front, with La Bella having previously dropped away, likely the result of having been in two breakaway moves. The attacking and bridging all proved to be in vain, however, with the break and reduced peloton reunited at the 25km mark.</p>\n<p>On the uphill road towards Witikon, the Dutch team assumed control at the front, though it would prove impossible to stave off further attacks.</p>\n<p>Those moves saw a small group go clear at the front once more, with Ferguson and Wolff again up there along with Gery, Arens, Ostiz, Chladonov√°, and Silo.</p>\n<p>Wolff and Gery wouldn‚Äôt stick up front over the top of Witikon, though, and neither would Arens or Silo, as the trio of Ferguson, Ostiz and Chladonov√° pushed on ahead past the 20km marker.</p>\n<p>Pursued by Gery, Arens and Silo, the leading break quickly drew out an advantage of 40 seconds with 15 kilometres to go, while the next group on the road lay well out of contention at 1:30 down.</p>\n<p>It looked increasingly as though the lead group would contest the rainbow jersey and the medal placings among themselves, a prospect that was surely beyond doubt at the 10km mark, where the trio had over a minute in the bank.</p>\n<p>With 6km to run, at the end of the descent from the plateau following Witikon, they were 1:30 clear and ready to start thinking about the rainbow jersey. There was no poker from that far out, though, with the cat-and-mouse games not coming until they hit the 2km mark.</p>\n<p>There was constant checking over shoulders heading under the flamme rouge, with Arens having gone solo from the chase behind. There was little to worry about, however, with the rainbows all but assured for one of the leading trio.</p>\n<p>Ostiz and then Ferguson took to the front during the glacially paced final kilometre, but it was the Spanish 17-year-old who launched the sprint for the line first, just inside the 200-metre mark.</p>\n<p>Ferguson wasn‚Äôt caught out by the early jump, however, and was the first to react. Her closing speed proved more than enough to hold off Ortiz and the trailing Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àov√° to secure her second rainbow jersey of the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>A nail-bitingly tight three-way battle in the Road World Championships mixed relay team time trial on Wednesday saw Australia claim the victory by less than a second over Germany, with Italy clinching bronze, just eight seconds further behind.</p>\n<p>When the three top nations&#8217; riders entered the final quarter of an extremely long, remorselessly rugged course running across the hills around Zurich, they were still only separated by a scant five seconds in Australia&#8217;s favour.</p>\n<p>A last-ditch effort by Grace Brown, already a winner of the World&#8217;s individual time trial last Saturday and teammate Brodie Chapman then just managed to keep Australia atop of the results table by the finish by the tiniest of margins.</p>\n<p>Bronze medallists in 2023, Germany had the consolation of going one better in 2024 with silver, while Italy fell off the pace slightly in the final kilometre to finish eight seconds down and complete the podium &#8211;  but still well ahead of fourth-placed France, 23 seconds back, in one of the most dramatic TTs in recent Worlds history.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling a bit greedy, I need a few more rainbow jerseys in my closet,&#8221; Brown joked afterwards as she added a second World Championships title to the one she took last weekend, &#8220;but this one&#8217;s really got a nice vibe, to do it with the whole Aussie crew. It&#8217;s really exciting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s teammate Michael Matthews added, &#8220;It was a hard one. I think Jay [Vine] put me to the sword on that first climb, I think we averaged about 650 Watts from bottom to top, so it was a hard day and there was not much recovery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we had to stick together as much as possible and keep our speed as high as possible. We came through with the fastest time [at the first checkpoint] and then we knew we had a really strong women&#8217;s team to finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Team Time Trial Mixed Relay is a relatively new event, offering a chance for men and women to compete together, even if they ride in different moments, first as a trio of men and then as a trio of women. The times of the two teams are combined to decide the final results.</p>\n<p>Mongolia were the first of the 18 teams to get the ball rolling on the very selective, unforgiving 53.7-kilometre course, by far the longest in the Mixed Relay&#8217;s five-year history, and featuring nearly 1,000 metres of vertical climbing. Nearly all of the first wave of 10 squads immediately began losing riders as soon as the men tackled the short, punchy first ascent, the Witikonerstrasse, with Mohamed Islam Jorat and Qais Haidari (Afghanistan) both dropping behind teammate Ahmad Mirzaye. Mirzaye then had his own share of problems when he crashed through a fence, fortunately without injuries.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China&#8217;s Lyu Xianging was visibly undecided about having to wait for compatriot Chengshuo Miao &#8211; which he eventually did &#8211;  and two Algerian riders had some sort of an on-bike disagreement about their lack of collaboration. Regardless of the course, on a difficult course, any such divisions, be they verbal or physical, inevitably came at a high price time-wise &#8211; and just as well it wasn&#8217;t raining. </p>\n<p>After the women&#8217;s half of the teams took over, China&#8217;s early best time of 1:23:39 was rapidly demolished by Ukraine, with a stunning result of 1:19:52. Only Estonia, 1:29 back, came anywhere close to their central European rivals, meaning Ukraine&#8217;s time was destined to stand as the initial target to beat for the second half of the competition. </p>\n<p>When the second, final, wave of eight teams began rolling down the ramps, despite losing Jonas Walton, Canada quickly upped the game at the first checkpoint (km11) with a provisional best time of 17:05 &#8211;  exactly a minute faster than Estonia. A super-strong USA trio including recent Vuelta a Espa√±a TT winner Brandon McNulty then pushed it even higher to 16:39, but the biggest hitters proved to be Germany, who went a full nine seconds faster, with Italy and Australia slotting in just behind.</p>\n<p>Double defending champion Switzerland suffered a major setback when Johan Jacobs was dropped less than five minutes into racing, almost certainly ruling them out of the medal battle. The German men, on the other hand, continued to go from strength to strength, blasting home in their half of the course in a top mark of 34:06 &#8211; only for a massive turn by Michael Matthews along the finishing straight in downtown Zurich to see Australia clock an even more impressive time of 33:44. </p>\n<p>Then there was yet more excitement as Italy pushed their way between Germany and leaders Australia, finishing just seven seconds down as their women&#8217;s trio of Elisa Longo Borghini, Soraya Paladin, and Gaia Realini took over. Gold then, was by no means out of reach for any of the first three teams atop of the results board at the half-way point, with France, just a second slower than Germany at the half-way point, still very much a medal contender as well.</p>\n<p>Fifth at the mid-way point, the USA women briefly claimed top time at checkpoint 3 (km 33) with a fine 54:28. But their time was kicked out of the park by Germany with 53:17, a massive 1:11 ahead, and despite losing Ruby Roseman-Gannon early on a climb, Australia steadied their own ship, too, to go five seconds faster.  Italy were only two seconds down on Australia, though, ensuring it would be a three-horse race for gold all the way to the line. France&#8217;s women, however, faded notably, leaving the podium &#8211; if not the order &#8211; all but decided.</p>\n<p>At the finish line, Germany blasted home at 1:12:53, more than two minutes ahead of the previous best Denmark. But it remained uncertain if that would be good enough to stand on top of the podium. Australia&#8217;s Brown and Chapman were giving it their all, though, on the flat final run-in that had already proved so critical to the men&#8217;s team effort, they just inched the German squad out of the top spot. It seemed incredible that there should be less than a second&#8217;s difference after such a tough 53-kilometre course between the top two teams, but the results board told a different story. But the cliffhanger finale had yet to reach a conclusion, as with a kilometre to go, TV images showed the Italians were still only a second behind the Australians.</p>\n<p>With their teammates and rivals all silently glued to the TV screens at the finish, as Italian duo Elisa Borghini and Gaia Realini closed in on the line, the tension could hardly have been any higher.  In the last 200 metres, though, the clock shifted in favour of the Australians and Germans, meaning the Italian team had to settle for bronze  &#8211; and a hugely entertaining time trial medals battle with the most uncertain of outcomes had finally been decided.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Although Kazakhsan&#8217;s Mariya Yelkina soon outstripped her by a second, both their times were eclipsed by the performance of Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àov√° who produced a stunning provisional best time of 24:24. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do TT training very often, so it was a big surprise for me,&#8221; the Slovakian, recently a European TT medallist who also practices MTB and cyclo-cross, said afterwards. But her time proved to be more than enough to earn her a medal finish all the same. </p>\n<p>Despite going the fastest by a sixth of a second at the turn (km 9.4), a disappointed Imogen Wolf (GB) subsequently narrowly missed out on the Slovakian&#8217;s time, finishing two seconds behind after her power meter failed to work properly. Rider after rider then failed to impact on either time set by the Slovakian and Briton, even if several of the key favourites were yet to start. </p>\n<p>Double Dutch National TT Champion Fee Knaven fired a warning shot across their bows with the second best time at the turn, but she faded in the second half &#8211; eventually settling for fourth. However, it was a very different story for Britain&#8217;s Cat Ferguson, the last rider to start and widely viewed as a top contender. Already 14 seconds up on Chlado≈àov√° at the time split, Ferguson then more than doubled that advantage to continue her blistering final season as a Junior with a definitive winning margin of over 34 seconds -well clear of the rest of the field.</p>\n<p>Later explaining her stunning TT performance, Ferguson said one key to success on a course with just 36 metres of elevation gain was that she had maintained her pacing strategy throughout.   </p>\n<p>&#8220;I had my ride, stuck to the plan, it was a bit windier than I thought, I was getting blown around a little bit, so I tried to keep my head down as much as possible,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kept to a set of Watts and tried to do it throughout, going out was as hard as on the way back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ferguson also paid tribute to those who helped her claim her first Junior Worlds title, saying  &#8220;It was helpful to have my coach in my ear, guiding me through and having someone there to support you and back you is so nice.&#8221; Then when she reached the finish line with the gold medal a certainty, her parents were there to greet her as well. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been there throughout my career, so to have them here today was great,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Ferguson is now set to start her first full pro season with Movistar in 2025, but with her TT triumph as one of her final Junior successes, her morale will surely be higher than ever as she embarks on the next stage of an already very promising career.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Iv√°n Romeo (Spain) pulled out a spectacular final 9.4 kilometres to win the men&#8217;s under-23 individual time trial world championship race on Monday.</p>\n<p>Romeo was 20 seconds behind Switzerland&#8217;s Jan Christen at the first check atop a gradual climb but made up time on the undulating middle section to close to within two seconds. Then, Romeo blasted through the flat final section to win the rainbow jersey by 41 seconds.</p>\n<p>Jakob Soderqvist (Sweden) also saved his bullets for the final stretch and cruised in for the silver medal at 32 seconds behind the Spaniard, coming in ahead of Christen by eight seconds.</p>\n<p>The home country had to settle for bronze as Christen&#8217;s time held even in the face of a stiff challenge from last year&#8217;s runner-up Alec Segaert (Belgium), who was quickest at the second check but then imploded in the final and finished fourth.</p>\n<p>Romeo called the victory, &#8220;the happiest day of my life&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked so hard for this,&#8221; Romeo said. &#8220;Few people know how bad I wanted this, only my close ones and my friends, my family. I&#8217;ve been here for 10 days with my father here in Zurich, seeing the parcours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the distance, I like the climb. It was pretty good for me, but you never know. At the beginning of the day it was raining for me, some descents were wet, so even having the best time when I arrived, I thought they were gonna be faster.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I pushed so hard in the last 10k &#8211; my pacing was meant to be like that, but I did not expect to have that power at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Paul Lomulia (Uganda) set the quickest early time but was soon eclipsed by Mateusz Gajdulewicz (Poland), but Isaac del Toro (Mexico) was flying and came through more than a minute faster than the Pole.</p>\n<p>Portugal&#8217;s Antonio Morgado was well behind his trade teammate at the second check and faded in the final section, dropping behind Matthias Schwarzbacher (Slovakia) to come third-fastest at the finish.</p>\n<p>Behind, Adam Rafferty (Ireland) and Christen were quicker than Del Toro at the first check by 22 and 34 seconds, respectively. Soon after, Romeo slotted in second-fastest at the first check and then surpassed Christen at the second check by a single second.</p>\n<p>Rafferty came through at the finish six seconds quicker than Del Toro and hot on his heels, Christen motored across the line a full 37 seconds faster. But the Swiss rider could only watch as Romeo came past 41 seconds ahead, having made up a huge margin in less than 10km.</p>\n<p>Also making up time was Segaert, who came through the second check with the quickest time, five seconds ahead of Romeo. Soderqvist made up time in the final phase to move into second overall at 32 seconds.</p>\n<p>It was only up to Segaert to see if he could get onto the podium but he faded into fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=46&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=46&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

De Kleijn powered past the fading Philipsen to nab second place.</p>\n<p>The 180.2 kilometre race around Koolskamp started under sunny skies with a fight for the breakaway, with three riders, Fabio Christen (Q36.5), Alex Colman (Flanders Baloise), Sam Gademan (Volkerwessels), earning the early TV time.</p>\n<p>Gademan lost contact in a section of crosswinds with 55km to go that also knocked Caleb Ewan out of contention and briefly distanced Philipsen, but the race came back together behind the two remaining leaders amid a series of turns and narrow roads.</p>\n<p>After the leading duo&#8217;s gap hovered at just over three minutes for most of the day, it was coming down quickly when Philipsen punctured and stopped in a turn with 37km to go.</p>\n<p>With Alpecin-Deceuninck taking their feet off the gas, the advantage went back out until Philipsen was back in and his team got back to work reeling in the escapees together with Soudal-Quickstep, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Lidl-Trek.</p>\n<p>The breakaway&#8217;s lead steadily dropped until the final lap, when Christen surged leaving Colman behind with 14km to go. The Swiss rider&#8217;s lead was hovering at 30 seconds when a crash very close to the front of the peloton on a narrow stretch of road disrupted the chase. Sam Welsford (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was the worst off, but Fabio Jakobsen (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL) was caught out, too.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe still had Jordi Meeus in the lead split as they hit the crosswinds with 9.5km to go and drove the pace as new European champion Tim Merlier (Soulda-Quickstep) was left behind in a chasing group.</p>\n<p>Christen continued to power on until he was caught by the first split inside 7km to go, but the peloton behind began to re-form. With 4.5km to go, the second peloton caught the first.</p>\n<p>Philipsen opened up the sprint but Merlier was able to come around the top in the slight right-hand bend to claim his first victory in the European Champion&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=167&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=167&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It wasn&#8217;t easy, because I didn‚Äôt have the best feeling and I was also blocked behind that crash, but thanks to Warre I could make it back just in time for the sprint.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier and Philipsen had to scramble back to the lead of the race after a crash split the peloton with 10km to go, but made it back with plenty of time to get into position on Philipsen&#8217;s wheel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was still hectic with that crash 10 kilometers from the finish&#8221;, Merlier said, adding the team weren&#8217;t involved in the crash but were stopped by it. &#8220;Then it was a team pursuit for us, but we were still able to catch up.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then I had to search a bit to see who I still had around me, because I had lost Bert (Van Lerberghe). Warre (Vangheluwe) brought me well and then I had to wait and pick up somewhere. That turned out to be Philipsen&#8217;s wheel.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Philipsen started the sprint early into a slight right-hand bend, trying to use the inside line to gain an advantage, but Merlier was too strong and was able to come around the long way and still snatch the victory. De Kleijn powered past the fading Philipsen to nab second place.</p>\n<p>The 180.2 kilometre race around Koolskamp started under sunny skies with a fight for the breakaway, with three riders, Fabio Christen (Q36.5), Alex Colman (Flanders Baloise), Sam Gademan (Volkerwessels), earning the early TV time.</p>\n<p>Gademan lost contact in a section of crosswinds with 55km to go that also knocked Caleb Ewan out of contention and briefly distanced Philipsen, but the race came back together behind the two remaining leaders amid a series of turns and narrow roads.</p>\n<p>After the leading duo&#8217;s gap hovered at just over three minutes for most of the day, it was coming down quickly when Philipsen punctured and stopped in a turn with 37km to go.</p>\n<p>With Alpecin-Deceuninck taking their feet off the gas, the advantage went back out until Philipsen was back in and his team got back to work reeling in the escapees together with Soudal-Quickstep, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Lidl-Trek.</p>\n<p>The breakaway&#8217;s lead steadily dropped until the final lap, when Christen surged leaving Colman behind with 14km to go. The Swiss rider&#8217;s lead was hovering at 30 seconds when a crash very close to the front of the peloton on a narrow stretch of road disrupted the chase. Sam Welsford (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was the worst off, but Fabio Jakobsen (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL) was caught out, too.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe still had Jordi Meeus in the lead split as they hit the crosswinds with 9.5km to go and drove the pace as new European champion Tim Merlier (Soulda-Quickstep) was left behind in a chasing group.</p>\n<p>Christen continued to power on until he was caught by the first split inside 7km to go, but the peloton behind began to re-form. With 4.5km to go, the second peloton caught the first.</p>\n<p>Philipsen opened up the sprint but Merlier was able to come around the top in the slight right-hand bend to claim his first victory in the European Champion&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=167&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=167&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Created in 2022 under the name Grisette Grand Prix de Wallonie, the race has been part of the International Cycling Union calendar in category 1.1 since its creation. It runs in Wallonia in September and its arrival takes place in Namur. The route of about 140 km starts from the province of Li√®ge to reach the citadel of Namur by a hilly route like the men&#8217;s Grand Prix of Wallonia.</p>\n<p>Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) won the Women&#8217;s GP Wallonie, triumphing on the closing climb of the Citadelle de Namur with a late burst to the line from a select group of favourites.</p>\n<p>She beat Elisa Longo Borghini (Lidl-Trek) into second place on the 3km long cobbled finisher while Anouska Koster (Uno-X Mobility) rounded out the podium at the end of 139km of racing through the Ardennes from Blegny.</p>\n<p>Swinkels‚Äô win, at the third edition of the women‚Äôs race, is the biggest of her career to date, coming in her first season at UAE following a three-year spell at Jumbo-Visma.<br />\nHer burst to win up the race‚Äôs final hill came after three-and-a-half hours of active racing with attacking in the final led largely by Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Italian duo Longo Borghini and Gaia Realini.</p>\n<p>The day‚Äôs main breakaway was caught just over 20km from the line, just in time for the challenging hilly finale.</p>\n<p>The dangerous group, consisting of Ilse Pluimers (AG Insurance-Soudal), Nina Buijsman (FDJ-Suez), Alenia Amialiusik (UAE Team ADQ), Alison Jackson (EF-Oatly-Cannondale) and Brodie Chapman (Lidl-Trek), only went clear in the second half of the race. It was no surprise that they were kept on a short leash and brought back well in time for the finish.</p>\n<p>Italian champion Longo Borghini pushed the pace on the C√¥te du Tienne-aux-Pierres soon after, setting up an attack by her teammate Realini.</p>\n<p>She pushed on solo, creating a gap of 45 seconds to the chasers. However, she wouldn‚Äôt last to the line, instead being brought back 7km out as FDJ-Suez led the chase.</p>\n<p>2023 Junior World Champion Julie Bego (Cofidis) was the first to try a big move on the finishing hill, but neither she nor Realini could break free at the front. Realini instead set up the sprint for Longo Borghini, who entered the closing straight in Swinkels‚Äô wheel.</p>\n<p>It looked like prime position for the Giro d‚ÄôItalia Women champion to speed past and claim her sixth victory of 2024. But Swinkels got the jump on her rivals, starting the sprint just as the leaders exited the final bend and holding off Longo Borghini for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17169&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17169&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event will consist of a total of 6 road races, 6 time trials, and 2 relays</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier of Belgium came from behind in a messy, hectic sprint to win the elite men&#8217;s road race title at the UEC Road European Championships in eastern Flanders.</p>\n<p>Belgium had opted for an unusual two-sprinter team tactic, with Merlier and Jasper Philipsen given the freedom to ride their own sprint.</p>\n<p>Philipsen managed to take the best line along the barriers but Merlier had far more speed and came along the outside. He soon got ahead of his rivals in sight of the line and had time to celebrate as Olav Kooij (Netherlands) took second and Madis Mihkels (Estonia) beat Philipsen to take third.</p>\n<p>Italy had controlled the attacks by Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) and Mads Pedersen (Denmark) during the 222km race and even led out the sprint only to be swamped in the final five hundred metres. Jonathan Milan struggled in the fight for the wheels and only finished 13th.</p>\n<p>Merlier took his 14th and arguably the biggest win of the 2024 season. He celebrated with his family and young son. He admitted that he lost his chain with three hundred metres to go but recovered in time to launch his winning sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;My chain came off with three hundred metres to go and I thought it was over. But I got going, found a gap and came out of the bunch at the right moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier confirmed that Belgium had a two-sprinter strategy because he was confident he could win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked to be in the race because I believed I could win the championship. I did it and I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This jersey means a lot, after twice being the Belgian national champion. I said it was my last goal of the year. I&#8217;ve worked for this. I had two hard crashes in the last two weeks but I kept believing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it infolded<br />\nThe riders signed on under a timid Belgian September sun, noticing that there was little wind. The sprinters were the happiest about the conditions, sensing their chances of a bunch sprint had increased, but they also feared that the climbs and cobbles of the 222.7km race around the Limburg lanes could shake up the race.</p>\n<p>The riders rolled out of the shadows of the Heusden-Zolder velodrome at speed, with Mathis Le Berre (France), Jonas Rutsch (Germany), Ivo Oliveira (Portugal), Nils Brun (Switzerland) and F√©lix Ritzinger (Austria) soon forming the early break.</p>\n<p>France put R√©mi Cavagna on the front to chase and Le Berre was soon ordered to sit on. That angered the riders in the break, with Oliveira shouting to Le Berre to drop back and other riders trying to gap him.</p>\n<p>The four plus Le Berre pushed on on the short laps of Hasselt but so did the peloton, with other nations putting a rider on the front to ensure the break never gained more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>The work of Cavagna reduced the gap to a minute as the attackers started the Printhagendreef cobbles, the first of nine sectors after 85km. The Op de Kriezel cobbles came soon after and had more of an effect. Ritzinger was dropped from the attack as Le Burre and France changed their tactics, deciding to ride and force other teams to chase.</p>\n<p>With 113km to go, the race twisted again and the final opened up early when Mathieu van der Poel made his first move. He surged away on an exposed sector and suddenly it was &#8216;race on!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Matteo Trentin joined him to defend Italy&#8217;s interests, as did other riders and Dutch teammate Mike Teunissen. They soon caught the break but the peloton soon caught them to bring the race back together. Van der Poel soon went again, trying to make for a hard race but he was marked each time, as the riders covered the first of three rolling and cobbled circuits.</p>\n<p>With 87km to go, on the Op de Kriezel cobbles, van der Poel went again and was again marked by Trentin. Mikkel Bjerg was also there for Denmark, while at the back, Tim Merlier had to chase after a puncture and roadside wheel change.</p>\n<p>After ten kilometres, a quality group of chasers joined the van der Poel group to form a dangerous attack. Kasper Asgreen and Bjerg were there with Pedersen and so they drove the pace, knowing the Belgians were absent. More chasers and more attacks came, as the hilly circuit and cobbles inspired real Classics racing.</p>\n<p>Next time up the Kolmontberg climb, Teunissen accelerated from the attack and Pedersen and Trentin joined him. Van der Poel wanted to be part of the action but missed the move, fortunately other riders closed the gap. The race came back together once again and Italy tried to control the peloton but more attacks came on the Op de Kriezel cobbled sector as the riders began the last lap of the circuit in south Limburg.</p>\n<p>With 55 km to go, Pedersen made another attack to try to split the peloton. Van der Poel jumped in with him again and so did Christophe Laporte of France and Danny van Poppel of the Netherlands. They did not want to wait for a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>However, Italy clearly did. Eduardo Affini used his time trial skills and domestique&#8217;s speed to chase, calling for Germany and Belgium to help him. There was suddenly only 50 km to race and only 50 or so riders in the peloton due to the intense and fast racing.</p>\n<p>In the attack were Mathieu van der Poel and Danny van Poppel (Netherlands), Christophe Laporte (France), Mads Pedersen (Denmark), Jonas Rutsch (Germany) and Arthur Kluckers (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>They gave their all but Italy and Belgium combined to drive the chase, pegging the gap at 15 seconds, with France and the Netherlands sitting in their wheels, watching and waiting.</p>\n<p>The break and the peloton powered over the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg climbs, with Affini and Maestri pulling for Italy and Teuns and Laurenz Rez for Belgium. A crash split the peloton just before the Printhagendreef cobbled sector but the catch finally came with 26km to go, the chances of a high-speed sprint finish becoming more certain.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Italian team took control of the peloton to set the pace and dissuade other attacks on the ride to the finish.</p>\n<p>There were seven Azzurri on the front, only Mosca absent after working a lot earlier in the race.

The event will consist of a total of 6 road races, 6 time trials, and 2 relays</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier of Belgium came from behind in a messy, hectic sprint to win the elite men&#8217;s road race title at the UEC Road European Championships in eastern Flanders.</p>\n<p>Belgium had opted for an unusual two-sprinter team tactic, with Merlier and Jasper Philipsen given the freedom to ride their own sprint.</p>\n<p>Philipsen managed to take the best line along the barriers but Merlier had far more speed and came along the outside. He soon got ahead of his rivals in sight of the line and had time to celebrate as Olav Kooij (Netherlands) took second and Madis Mihkels (Estonia) beat Philipsen to take third.</p>\n<p>Italy had controlled the attacks by Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) and Mads Pedersen (Denmark) during the 222km race and even led out the sprint only to be swamped in the final five hundred metres. Jonathan Milan struggled in the fight for the wheels and only finished 13th.</p>\n<p>Merlier took his 14th and arguably the biggest win of the 2024 season. He celebrated with his family and young son. He admitted that he lost his chain with three hundred metres to go but recovered in time to launch his winning sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;My chain came off with three hundred metres to go and I thought it was over. But I got going, found a gap and came out of the bunch at the right moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier confirmed that Belgium had a two-sprinter strategy because he was confident he could win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked to be in the race because I believed I could win the championship. I did it and I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This jersey means a lot, after twice being the Belgian national champion. I said it was my last goal of the year. I&#8217;ve worked for this. I had two hard crashes in the last two weeks but I kept believing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it infolded<br />\nThe riders signed on under a timid Belgian September sun, noticing that there was little wind. The sprinters were the happiest about the conditions, sensing their chances of a bunch sprint had increased, but they also feared that the climbs and cobbles of the 222.7km race around the Limburg lanes could shake up the race.</p>\n<p>The riders rolled out of the shadows of the Heusden-Zolder velodrome at speed, with Mathis Le Berre (France), Jonas Rutsch (Germany), Ivo Oliveira (Portugal), Nils Brun (Switzerland) and F√©lix Ritzinger (Austria) soon forming the early break.</p>\n<p>France put R√©mi Cavagna on the front to chase and Le Berre was soon ordered to sit on. That angered the riders in the break, with Oliveira shouting to Le Berre to drop back and other riders trying to gap him.</p>\n<p>The four plus Le Berre pushed on on the short laps of Hasselt but so did the peloton, with other nations putting a rider on the front to ensure the break never gained more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>The work of Cavagna reduced the gap to a minute as the attackers started the Printhagendreef cobbles, the first of nine sectors after 85km. The Op de Kriezel cobbles came soon after and had more of an effect. Ritzinger was dropped from the attack as Le Burre and France changed their tactics, deciding to ride and force other teams to chase.</p>\n<p>With 113km to go, the race twisted again and the final opened up early when Mathieu van der Poel made his first move. He surged away on an exposed sector and suddenly it was &#8216;race on!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Matteo Trentin joined him to defend Italy&#8217;s interests, as did other riders and Dutch teammate Mike Teunissen. They soon caught the break but the peloton soon caught them to bring the race back together. Van der Poel soon went again, trying to make for a hard race but he was marked each time, as the riders covered the first of three rolling and cobbled circuits.</p>\n<p>With 87km to go, on the Op de Kriezel cobbles, van der Poel went again and was again marked by Trentin. Mikkel Bjerg was also there for Denmark, while at the back, Tim Merlier had to chase after a puncture and roadside wheel change.</p>\n<p>After ten kilometres, a quality group of chasers joined the van der Poel group to form a dangerous attack. Kasper Asgreen and Bjerg were there with Pedersen and so they drove the pace, knowing the Belgians were absent. More chasers and more attacks came, as the hilly circuit and cobbles inspired real Classics racing.</p>\n<p>Next time up the Kolmontberg climb, Teunissen accelerated from the attack and Pedersen and Trentin joined him. Van der Poel wanted to be part of the action but missed the move, fortunately other riders closed the gap. The race came back together once again and Italy tried to control the peloton but more attacks came on the Op de Kriezel cobbled sector as the riders began the last lap of the circuit in south Limburg.</p>\n<p>With 55 km to go, Pedersen made another attack to try to split the peloton. Van der Poel jumped in with him again and so did Christophe Laporte of France and Danny van Poppel of the Netherlands. They did not want to wait for a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>However, Italy clearly did. Eduardo Affini used his time trial skills and domestique&#8217;s speed to chase, calling for Germany and Belgium to help him. There was suddenly only 50 km to race and only 50 or so riders in the peloton due to the intense and fast racing.</p>\n<p>In the attack were Mathieu van der Poel and Danny van Poppel (Netherlands), Christophe Laporte (France), Mads Pedersen (Denmark), Jonas Rutsch (Germany) and Arthur Kluckers (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>They gave their all but Italy and Belgium combined to drive the chase, pegging the gap at 15 seconds, with France and the Netherlands sitting in their wheels, watching and waiting.</p>\n<p>The break and the peloton powered over the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg climbs, with Affini and Maestri pulling for Italy and Teuns and Laurenz Rez for Belgium. A crash split the peloton just before the Printhagendreef cobbled sector but the catch finally came with 26km to go, the chances of a high-speed sprint finish becoming more certain.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Italian team took control of the peloton to set the pace and dissuade other attacks on the ride to the finish.</p>\n<p>There were seven Azzurri on the front, only Mosca absent after working a lot earlier in the race. However, also waiting for a sprint finish were Olav Kooij (Netherlands), Alexander Kristoff (Norway), Arnaud D√©mare (France), Jasper Philipsen (Belgium) and Tim Merlier (Belgium) in the 53-rider group.</p>\n<p>The riders passed through the finish with 14.2km to go, with Germany and France moving up to the front.

The race has been organized since 2004 and serves as a memory of Marco Pantani. The race starts in Cesenatico, Pantani&#8217;s hometown, and follows a route towards his birthplace, Cesena. In 2007 the race was organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. In 2013, the race was merged with the Giro della Romagna, a race in the same region.</p>\n<p>Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) continued his incredible run of success, winning the Memorial Marco Pantani in Italy on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Swiss rider has won his last five races, since starting his summer campaign at the Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa. On Thursday, he won the Coppa Sabatini with a long solo breakaway. He won the Memorial Marco Pantani in a sprint after a two-rider attack was caught inside the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Hirschi beat Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar) and Vincenzo Albanese (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) in the sprint in the centre of Marco Pantani&#8217;s hometown of Cesenatico.</p>\n<p>Hirschi is expected to ride Sunday&#8217;s Trofeo Matteotti further down the Adriatic coast and then next week&#8217;s five-day Tour de Luxembourg before the World Championships in Zurich on Sunday, September 29.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Luck is on my side at the moment, so it&#8217;s nice to continue my winning series,&#8221; Hirshi said post-race. &#8220;It was a tough race. We controlled it from the start and then we opened the race early.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Baroncini attacked and it was a good situation for us, with three guys and probably one of the fastest guys there, then with three others behind in the peloton.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We tried to block but unfortunately we caught Baroncini with like 300 metres to go, so we changed the plan and I sprinted. I was a bit lucky, I followed the heels and came from the back. There was a lot of headwind and so the gap opened, and I could get through in the end and win again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 195km one-day Italian race once again remembered the former Giro d&#8217;Italia and Tour de France winner, starting inland in Cesena and ending in Cesenatico after five circuits of the Diolaguardia climb. The final 50km were on flat roads to the coast and then covered a short finishing circuit.</p>\n<p>Filippo Turconi (VF Bardiani Csf Faizan√®) Ivan Romeo (Movistar) Simon Carr (EF Education-EasyPost) and Valentin Ferron (TotalEnergies) formed an early break and then Diego Ulissi (UAE) Giulio Pellizzari (VF Bardiani Csf Faizan√®) and Gregor Muhlberger (Movistar) also tried a move on the Diolaguardia climb, as UAE Team Emirates played out different tactics.</p>\n<p>The trio were caught with 72km to go, on the Diolaguardia, and so Baroncini (UAE) Matteo Vercher (Total Energies) Marco Brenner (Tudor) attacked on the descent. Vercher was dropped on the last climb and the 2021 under-23 world champion and the current German national champion rode to Cesenatico together.</p>\n<p>Despite some blocking by UAE Team Emirates, the peloton finally got organised during the last five-kilometre lap of Cesenatico and caught Baroncini and Brenner in sight of the finish line.</p>\n<p>As they consoled each other with a handshake, Hirsch emerged from the wheels, waited for the right moment and then accelerated past Albanese and Milesi to win yet again.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=68&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=68&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The peloton passed through the finish line for the first time just 27km into the race and then embarked on opening short circuits, a large loop and finishing circuits in Hasselt.</p>\n<p>There were six cobbled sectors on the course that added to the dynamics of the race along with four categorised ascents: Kolmontberg (700m at 4.4%) and Zammelenberg (800m at 3.8%), which were tackled a second time on the final lap of the large circuit, before entering the Hasselt finish circuits.</p>\n<p>There were several crashes, mechanicals and a flurry of attacks as the peloton departed from Heusden-Zolder but the field remained intact as they entered the first cobbled sectors of the race.</p>\n<p>The Dutch team with defending champion Mischa Bredewold managed the pace at the front of the field but after multiple attacks from riders on the Belgian and Spanish teams, and then a countermove from Nikola Noskov√° (Czech Republic), the field split with roughly 50 riders in the front group.</p>\n<p>Mireia Benito (Spain) was the first rider to gain any significant time on the peloton, led by the Dutch squad, pushing her lead out to 20 seconds ahead of the back-to-back climb over the Kolmontbberg and Zammelenberg on the first large circuit.</p>\n<p>Benito crested the two climbs and maintained a gap of 25 seconds over the peloton, while Jade Wiel (France) attempted to bridge across to the solo breakaway rider. Wiel&#8217;s efforts to bridge across were short lived, however and both she and Benito&#8217;s time out front came to an end as the race reached the Op de Kriezel cobblestone sector with 58 km to go.</p>\n<p>Audrey Cordon-Ragot (France), Liane Lippert (Germany), and the Dutch trio Bredewold, Loes Adegeest and Thatlita de Jong formed a new five-rider move but that too was short lived and the reduced field was back together on the second large circuit ahead of the Kolmontbberg and Zammelenberg.</p>\n<p>Another series of attacks came from riders from the Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium, but Sara Martin (Spain) was the only rider to successfully open a gap inside 30km to go. As the Spanish rider pushed her lead out to 20 seconds, Germany&#8217;s Lea Lin Teutenberg and then her teammate Lippert gave chase, followed by Nina Berton (Luxembourg) and Marion Norbert (Belgium) but none were strong enough to make it across the gap.</p>\n<p>Martin&#8217;s gap increased to nearly 30 seconds as she raced through the finish line at the start of the last 15 km circuit. But the eight-rider Dutch team pulled to the front of the peloton, slashing the gap in half on the flat circuit, and then caught Martin with 12km to go.</p>\n<p>The Dutch riders led the field into the final kilometres of the race with a lead-out that hit speeds of over 53 km/h. They  were eventually challenged by the French and Italian teams inside the last kilometre and the sprint became chaotic as Italy surged on the left. </p>\n<p>Wiebes lost her lead out but wisely got on the Italian train and then kicked at the same as Balsamo with two hundred metres to go.

Frenchman L√©andre Lozouet rounded out the podium to take the bronze medal 10 seconds later.</p>\n<p>Artz, Behrens and Lozouet went away in the winning move with over 40km to go ahead of the day&#8217;s final climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg.</p>\n<p>Scattered chase groups behind looked at one point to be dragging back the 30-second gap the leaders enjoyed over the final climb, but there wasn&#8217;t enough strength or coordination behind to fully eat into the lead on the closing local laps.</p>\n<p>14km from the line, as the riders passed through the finish line for the penultimate time, just 20 seconds separated the leaders from the chase of Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg) and Fabian Weiss (Switzerland).</p>\n<p>However, that was as close as those behind would get to the front of the race, leaving the three up front to decide the medal positions. Inside the final 5km, Lozouet was forced to let go of gold and silver as Behrens attacked to leave him behind.</p>\n<p>Artz stuck with the German, however, and had enough in the sprint to just edge out the 20-year-old in the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing. I didn&#8217;t expect to win,&#8221; Artz said after taking the win. &#8220;I was thinking all week &#8216;How can I possibly win?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a good group with three Dutch riders and then we went early with three of us but we were all strong riders. In the end, it would be a matter of who had the fastest legs and it was me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I said to my directeur sportif that I think it&#8217;ll be a sprint and I was waiting, waiting. In the end, the race broke open earlier than I thought. I&#8217;m happy that it turned out like this. It was perfect.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the time trialing over and done with at this year&#8217;s UEC Road European Championships, attention on Friday turned to the road races, with the U23 men tackling a 162km course between Heusden-Zolder and Hasselt after the U23 women had earlier opened the road racing action.</p>\n<p>The course featured six cobbled sectors including two major cobbled climbs. Two ascents of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg both came on two laps of a challenging Limburg circuit.</p>\n<p>Carl Kagevi (Sweden), Halvor Sandstad (Norway), Stian Rosenlund (Denmark), Julian Borresch (Germany), Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg), Roman Holzer (Switzerland) and Mateusz Gajdulewicz (Poland) formed the first breakaway of the day, but with the Belgian and Dutch teams controlling the pace, their lead never went much over half a minute.</p>\n<p>Once the race reached the Limburg circuit, another group got away with French trio Pierre Gautherat, Matys Grisel and L√©andre Lozouet joined by Dutch trio of Huub Artz, Tibor del Grosso and Jesse Kramer, as well as Rasmus S√∏jberg Pedersen (Denmark, Alessandro Borgo (Italy), Niklas Behrens (Germany), Fabian Weiss (Switzerland), Matyas Kopecky (Czechia), and Alexandre Kess (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>The first climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg sparked a counterattack of nine riders as the race reached the cobbles of Manshoven where Lozouet, Artz and Behrens got away from the leaders.</p>\n<p>With more cobbles lying ahead on the Kriezel, their lead grew over the 13 chasers ‚Äì Belgians Steffen De Schuyteneer and Sente Sentjens, plus Gautherat, Grisel, Del Groso, Kramer, Pedersen, Borgo, Christen, Weiss, Kopecky, Kess and Wenzel.</p>\n<p>On the Zammelenberg, the chase group lost Grisel, while the peloton behind was in tatters. With 35km to go, Wenzel and Weiss attacked to try to go across but struggled to close the gap, which held at just over 30 seconds at 20km to go.</p>\n<p>The second chase group featuring the Belgians was long gone and lay almost a minute further behind, with the peloton 2:30 from the leaders. Up front, the leading trio had plenty of work to do to hold off the chase behind, but with the closest groups splitting into ones and twos on the toughest sections of the course, they just had to keep working together.</p>\n<p>The leaders continued towards the finish holding a slim lead of never more than 30 seconds, but it proved to be enough to settle the race for the title as they fought amongst themselves during the closing circuit in Hasselt.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was Artz who prevailed in the sprint for the line, outpacing Behrens after the pair had distanced Lozouet a handful of kilometres away from the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2020, it was added to the UCI ProSeries, upgrading its classification to 1.Pro.</p>\n<p>Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) added another one-day race victory to his palmar√®s at the Coppa Sabatini, soloing home from 37km out at the hilly Italian semi-Classic.</p>\n<p>The Swiss rider scored his fourth race win in a row and the 20th of his career after going clear over the closing circuit hill of the Via Mazzini in Peccioli (1.4km at 5.8%) after 160km of racing, leaving the peloton behind and pulling out a gap over half a minute on the run to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Gregor M√ºhlberger (Movistar) scored second place from the sprint in the chasing group 28 seconds back, while Anders Foldager (Jayco-AlUla) took third place.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI knew the race, I knew it was demanding and I wanted to try this move from afar.

Behind him, Davide Formolo (Movistar) briefly gave chase alongside Balmer before both were brought back.</p>\n<p>Diego Ulissi controlled the situation behind for Hirschi, though a group of chasers formed as the race hit the final 30km. Foldager was in the move along with Alexey Lutsenko (Astana Qazaqstan), Orluis Aular (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and others, but Hirschi was only increasing his advantage.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final lap of 12km, he enjoyed a 40-second lead over a chase group including M√ºhlberger, Foldager, Kristian Sbaragli (Corratec-Vini Fantini) and Axel Huens (TDT-Unibet), while the peloton lay 1:30 adrift.</p>\n<p>With the result pretty much set already, those behind began to think about the podium fight, while up front Hirschi could enjoy his victory solo.

Orluis Aular (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) rounded out the podium. </p>\n<p>The day was marked by exceptionally high temperatures, frequently over 40¬∞C, as a breakaway group formed early in the race but was reeled in with 50km left.</p>\n<p>The peloton became fragmented, though, within the race‚Äôs final finishing circuits as a group of 20 riders emerged containing, amongst others, Javier Romo (Movistar), Einer Rubio (Movistar), Maxim Van Gils (Lotto Dstny), Champoussin, Simmons, and Barrenetxea.</p>\n<p>The group shed multiple riders on the steep 10% inclines of Alto de Pike before Barrenetxea emerged victorious on the short but testing final ascent into Getxo.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=202&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=202&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the most important one-day race in Spain, is considered a one-day race of great prestige, just behind the &#8216;Monuments&#8217;, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking. Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n is known for its winding, undulating terrain which favours aggressive riding, favouring climbers. It includes the tough Alto de Jaizkibel climb, usually the decisive point of the race. It is one of the three summer classics that form part of the UCI World Tour calendar, along with the Laurentian Classics.</p>\n<p>Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) took a striking win at Donostia San Sebasti√°n Klasikoa in a two-up sprint against Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal-Quickstep) after the two made a blistering attack on the final ascent of the 236km Basque race.</p>\n<p>The two rode clear on the ascent of Pilotegi with 7km remaining, with an attack ignited by Alaphilippe. They quickly carved a lead on the remnants of the main peloton, before setting up for a cat-and-mouse sprint where Hirshi proved the stronger sprinter of the two after opening his sprint within the final 200m into Donostia San Sebasti√°n.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto Dstny) managed to follow their initial move but was unable to bridge to the duo out front, but secured third place ahead of Kevin Vermaerke (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) who won the sprint for fourth.</p>\n<p>Speaking after the finish, Hirschi described the race as ‚Äúsuper hard‚Äù.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe went so fast, and then we just climbed,‚Äù he said of the final ascent, ‚ÄúWe just suffered to the top and then we looked back and we were only two so we knew we had to continue and we had a nice sprint.‚Äù</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates had picked Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) as the day‚Äôs major threat, but the Dane failed to make a dent in the race and was instead dropped on the day‚Äôs main climb of Jaizkibel. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe were surprised Vingegaard didn&#8217;t feel so strong on the second last climb,‚Äù Hirschi said. ‚ÄúSo actually we had a plan that after the Tour if [Vingegaard] doesn‚Äôt feel super we‚Äôre going to attack with Pavel or Jan [Christen] and then was good for us as we sit on the wheel.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Sivakov‚Äôs attack was one of the day‚Äôs most impressive solo moves &#8211; animating the final 40km of racing. ‚ÄúI think if there was one less Lotto-Soudal guy Pavel would win today,‚Äù Hirschi said. ‚ÄùThey closed and we were ready, we were three guys still so we went full gas on the last climb.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Hirschi described the day as a ‚Äúvery very big victory and means a lot to me. Next to Tour de France victory and Fl√®che Wallonne this is one of my biggest wins in cycling.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Alaphilippe was also happy with his ride when interviewed shortly after the finish, despite missing his opportunity to take a repeat victory at the race he won in 2018.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI feel happy to be back on the podium of a big race and of course little bit disappointed to be really close,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I think I did a good race and did my best so happy with this second place.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was really suffering, I felt good so I did my tempo,‚Äù he said of the last climb. ‚ÄúIn the end, I did my best, and Marc Hirschi was really strong. He did a good sprint, good timing and he‚Äôs also really explosive.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton set off to sunny coastal splendour in Donostia San Sebasti√°n, with a 236km loop in the harsh undulations of the Basque separating them from a return to the very same finishing spot.</p>\n<p>Ahead of them, seven categorised ascents would punctuate a route with barely a flat kilometre within it. The key decisive climbs on the route ahead promised to be the Jaizkibel (7.9km at 5.5%) with around 75km remaining and the savagely steep Erlaitz (3.8km at 10.7%) with 45km remaining.</p>\n<p>Attacks came quickly from the peloton with Alpecin-Deceuninck populating the early attacks, before a group of 10 managed to ride clear just after 40km of riding.</p>\n<p>The breakaway contained Davide De Pretto (Jayco AlUla), Simon Carr (EF Education &#8211; EasyPost), Warren Barguil (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL), Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto Dstny), Jes√∫s Herrada (Cofidis), Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe), √Ödne Holter (Uno-X Mobility), Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier (Lidl-Trek), Thibault Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies).</p>\n<p>The group worked well together for the bulk of the day‚Äôs racing, shedding no one from their ranks and holding a three-minute lead with 80km remaining, as the race too to the ascent of Jaizkibel.</p>\n<p>The steep ramps of the Jaizkibel were enough to shed most of the breakaway, who were caught by the peloton in quick succession, with Carr, Ghebreigzabhier and Zwiehoff leading over the summit.</p>\n<p>By the end of the descent from Jaizkibel, Carr found himself solo but showing impressive form as he held nearly a minute gap on the approach to the 3.8km 10.7% slopes of Erlaitz.</p>\n<p>The ramps proved to be too testing, and Carr was reeled back barely a kilometre into the ascent. His return to the peloton was quickly met with an attack by Julian Alaphilippe and Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe ). They were joined by Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates), who attacked solo as the two initial attackers were reeled back well before the summit.</p>\n<p>Sivakov rode solo over the peak of Erlaitz with 40km separating him from the finish,. Behind him a fragmented peloton selected only the strongest climbers of the day, and even shed the likes of Jonas Vingegaard and Hugh Carthy.</p>\n<p>His effort was a brave one, and despite barely establishing a half-minute gap the French rider held a slim but viable margin of 15 seconds into the finish town of Donostia San Sebasti√°n, where a 16km circuit would conclude the race.</p>\n<p>The finish circuit‚Äôs central climb of Pilotegi (2.1km at 10.8%) proved too much for Sivakov, as his strong solo effort was pulled in with 9km remaining.</p>\n<p>His brief breakaway partner Alaphilippe showed his hand on the final brutal 15% slopes of the climb as he danced away from the remains of the day‚Äôs peloton with only Marc Hirschi able to match his pace.</p>\n<p>The two left no doubt about their finishing form, quickly carving a gap to the remaining field, and the stage was set for an electric two-up sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But as soon as the kilometre-to-go flag had been passed, Martinez accelerated hard, and in just a few minutes, his fourth place in the same race in 2023 became first place in 2024.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a very tough race,‚Äù said Martinez afterwards, ‚ÄúI fell quite hard when somebody behind me touched a wheel, and as a result, I went down, too.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúCl√©ment and I got away in the finale and it worked out quite well, we collaborated. It was much better that way because Israel-Premier Tech had two riders behind, and the gaps were tight. But we made it.‚Äù.</p>\n<p>On the first three major ascents, the 20.4 kilometre Col de Baisse de Cabanette-Peira Cava, a move by Total Energies racer and former French TT champion Pierre Latour brought him across to the strongest rider of a break of five, Valentin Retailleau (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale). Recently the winner of a stage of Boucles de la Mayenne, Retailleau and his compatriot Latour dived over the summit with a steadily increasing margin.</p>\n<p>Retailleau then went solo, quickly pushing his lone advantage to two minutes. But just before the summit of the Col Saint Martin-La Comiane, the second big climb of the day, he was caught by a shrinking peloton driven by Groupama-FDJ.</p>\n<p>On the long drop to the most difficult ascent of them all, the Col de la Couillole &#8211; set to be used in the upcoming Tour de France as its last mountain top finish on stage 20 &#8211; the reduced peloton remained more or less stable. However, as soon as they hit the lower slopes of the 15.9-kilometre ascent, Groupama-FDJ opened up the throttle again, rapidly further shredding the field thanks to former Vuelta an Espa√±a leader Rudy Molard. </p>\n<p>Less than a third of the way up and despite a crash early on the climb, Mart√≠nez launched an attack that tested the group. But the first real duel came between Mart√≠nez teammate David Gaudu and Israel-Premier Tech‚Äôs George Bennett. Bennett finally managed to drop the Frenchman for a brief lone break, only for Martinez to drag a tiny group of chasers back up. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13188&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13188&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"
