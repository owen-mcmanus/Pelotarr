It is one of six season-long competitions. In contrary to the other competitions, the Ethias Cross does not award points or compose an overall ranking, but rather consists of separate races. Sponsored by the Belgian hardware chain Brico for the first three seasons and then by the Belgian insurance company Ethias from 2019 to 2022, its main sponsor is the enterprise software provider Exact.</p>\n<p>Niels Vandeputte (Alpecin-Deceuninck) dominated the final round of the Exact Cross series in Sint-Niklaas on Saturday in northern Belgium, taking a fourth victory of the season to go along with 10 other podiums.</p>\n<p>The 24-year-old led from the holeshot, with Lars van der Haar (Baloise Glowi) using two final laps to close the gap, but could not close down the last 25 seconds.

She battled for all five laps against Sara Casasola (Crelan-Corendon) and made her winning pass in the signature sand section just before the finish line of Waaslandcross, leaving the Italian with four seconds back in second place.</p>\n<p>Crelan-Corendon pitted two riders against Brand, with Casasola&#8217;s teammate Inge van der Heijden fading late in the contest and taking third, 34 seconds back, with time to spare to the Belgian chasers Julie Brouwers (Charles Liégeois Roastery CX) in fourth and Marion Norbert Riberolle (Crelan-Corendon) in fifth.</p>\n<p>The seventh round of the regional series was held in northern Belgium on a cold, clear day, bright sunshine bouncing off the wide Waasland sand sections along the lake. Brand, who competed in only two rounds of Exact Cross, won Saturday&#8217;s contest for a fourth time in her career, now tied Sanne Cant with the most victories at the event.</p>\n<p>For Brand, it was her 10th victory of the cyclocross season, where she swept titles at the World Cup, Superprestige and X2O Badkamers Trofee series for a third time in her career. She only raced two of the Exact Cross events, going third at the opener in Beringen and then winning the finale at Sint-Niklaas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every victory is different, you cannot compare victories with each other. But I am extremely happy that I was able to win ten times this season,&#8221; Brand told Het Nieuwsblad. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The legs didn&#8217;t feel so fresh anymore, but that&#8217;s probably logical at the end of the season. I was happy that the pace dropped off a bit now and then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brand removed quickly around Inge Van Der Heijden to the front in order to avoid the massive swarm up the first of several large runups. On lap two, Casasola attacked and the Italian took a five-second lead on Brand and Van der Heijden. However, a fall by Casasola on the slippery off-camber corner allowed Brand to rejoin and two matched pedal strokes for most of the next three laps.</p>\n<p>Brand threw the hammer down through the wide sand section on the final lap, gaining a handful of seconds with a decisive pass of the Italian. Brand held her momentum in the final corners and hit the straightaway to the finish for a four-second margin, scoring her 10th victory of the cyclocross season. </p>\n<p>Casasola went four-for-four with podiums at Exact Cross races this season, while her teammate Van der Heijden scored four podiums in five starts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I tried to attack several times, but that wasn&#8217;t enough,&#8221; Casasola told Sporza at the finish. &#8220;Could I have done anything differently in the final round? I don&#8217;t think so, because I was at my limit and Lucinda was very strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15130&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15130&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>The 2024 UCI Road World Championships witnessed history in the making on Sunday as Tadej Pogačar became the first rider in 37 years to follow up this season&#8217;s victories in the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Tour de France with a gold medal and the rainbow jersey in the elite men&#8217;s road race.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian claimed cycling&#8217;s Triple Crown in devastating style, breaking away from the main peloton with 100 kilometres to go, blasting through a 16-rider move then going solo some 50 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Pogačar looked briefly to be in trouble as his gap dipped below 40 seconds on the final lap, but he still remained clear for Slovenia&#8217;s first ever road race gold medal, his 23rd win of the 2024 season, and another giant step towards becoming a legend of the sport.</p>\n<p>The silver medal went to late attacker Ben O&#8217;Connor (Australia), crossing the line 31 seconds behind, with defending champion Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) then claiming the bronze.</p>\n<p>But in one of the most stunning World Championships rides in the race&#8217;s history, the day in cycling, the year and perhaps even the decade all belonged to Pogačar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe what just happened, after this kind of season, I put a lot of pressure on myself for today. I had pressure from myself, from the team, we came here for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race unfolded pretty quick and there was a dangerous break in the front, I maybe did a stupid attack, luckily Jan [Tratnik] was there with me and I never gave up until the final. It&#8217;s an incredible day, I can&#8217;t believe what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogačar confirmed that his attack at 100 kilometres to go, an enormous distance even by the Slovenian&#8217;s standards, had not been planned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course,it was not planned. We had planned to keep race under control but the race went quite early and I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking and I just went also, I went with the flow and luckily I made it, but it was so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure I wanted this title, after many years fighting for the Tour de France and other races, I never had a World Championships as a pure goal, and this year everything went smoothly already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a perfect season, this was a big goal to win the World Championships and I can&#8217;t believe it happened, I have to thank the whole team, without them it would not have been possible and I&#8217;m super proud of the national team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nJust as in the elite women&#8217;s equivalent event, at the start in Winterthur a minute&#8217;s silence was held in memory of Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died from injuries incurred in a crash in Thursday&#8217;s race. Once again, too, the Swiss team stood at the front of the bunch during the brief but moving ceremony. Then the flag dropped and after a thankfully short neutralized section on the typically drawn-out Worlds course, racing on a dry, cool day got underway.</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 kilometres, when it came to the early break nothing seemed to be sticking. But at last a concerted effort went clear with local hero Silvan Dillier (Switzerland), Luc Wirtgen (Luxembourg), and Piotr Pekala (Poland) receiving further valuable reinforcements in the shape of former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Norway), Rui Oliveira (Portugal), Simon Geschke (Germany), Markus Pajur (Estonia) and Roberto Carlos Gonzalez (Panama). Pajur and Gonzalez started struggling almost immediately, but more than enough firepower and variety in talent remained amongst the half-dozen breakaways to handle the dauntingly difficult terrain that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>In a largely uneventful opening segment, a small crash for Pello Bilbao (Spain) into a farmyard fence saw the veteran outsider in some pain but able to continue. However, the same was not true of Julian Alaphilippe, whose hopes of a record-equalling third rainbow jersey ended prematurely when the Frenchman fell and had to quit even before the race had reached the finishing circuit around Zurich.</p>\n<p>Then for over an hour a holding pattern emerged, with Victor Campenaerts and Jan Tratnik, working for Belgium and Slovenia respectively, keeping the half-dozen ahead under control at around four minutes. There was no sign of the Netherlands though, despite their fielding the third big favourite of the day, defending champion Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>Finally Pablo Castrillo, the recent double Vuelta a a España stage winner, made the first attack from the quiescent pack on the seven laps of the Zurich circuit. Castrillo rapidly self-combusted, but his brief dig contrasted sharply with the much more insistent drive that followed by ten other dangerously strong riders and nations: Jay Vine (Australia), Laurens De Plus (Belgium), Stevie Williams (GB), Kevin Vermaerke (USA), Magnus Cort (Denmark), Matteo Cattaneo (Italy), Johannes Staune-Mittet (Norway), Florian Lipowitz (Germany) Pavel Sivakov (France) and Slovenia&#8217;s Tratnik.</p>\n<p>Logically enough given their leaders and two top favourites were still safely in the peloton, neither Slovenia nor Belgium were prepared to work in the break. The key question was, perhaps, who would be willing to spearhead the pursuit in the bunch behind &#8211; and the initial answer was &#8216;nobody&#8217;, allowing the 10 counter-attackers rapidly to carve open a promising gap of over three minutes.</p>\n<p> The &#8216;who&#8217;ll blink first&#8217; strategy continued in the pack far longer than expected, and with four 26.9-kilometre laps to go, the two breaks fused, creating a lead 16-man group. A concerted, if belated, response by Denmark, Spain and the USA in the peloton dampened feelings amongst some TV commentators that the winner was now bound to be coming from the front group. Then when Slovenia also opted to chase with Domen Novak behind despite having Tratnik ahead, it was clear that something much more serious was still brewing in the pack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the attack</strong><br />\nAnd so what proved to be the race&#8217;s defining moment suddenly hove into view. Pogačar himself opted to make a move, blasting up the right side of a draggy climb at the jaw-dropping distance of just over 100 kilometres to go. Andrea Bagioli (Italy) was the only one to briefly follow him as Pogačar yelled at Slovenian roadside team staff to tell him the gap on his chasers. But by the time Tratnik dropped back to tow the Slovenian up to the break, the Italian was long out of the duo&#8217;s rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Conventional thinking suggested Pogačar&#8217;s audacious move was too early, even with memories of his 81-kilometre charge away at Strade Bianche and numerous other long-distance attacks to justify it. Certainly no-one could possibly have anticipated such a bid for victory, made at a moment when none of the favourites had even begun to start to think about attacking. But as has been proved time and again by Pogačar in bike races, conventional thinking just does not apply to the Slovenian&#8217;s way of racing, and at the 2024 Worlds he was to prove that to a game-changing new limit.</p>\n<p>Reckless or not, Belgium were understandably extremely troubled by the Slovenian&#8217;s disappearance up the road, driving hard in the bunch to try and reduce the gap. The Belgians would likely have been even more worried to learn that as soon as Pogačar reached the break ahead with Tratnik as his escort, he then made it clear he meant business by briefly clipping off the front of the race. However, even for a rider as exceptional as the Slovenian, going solo at 90 kilometres from the finish was perhaps too ambitious a move and he eased back into the group of 16 again.</p>\n<p>The gap was hovering at just over a minute at 83 kilometres to go as Tratnik delivered some textbook tactics to a highly unusual race scenario and unsurprisingly rode himself into the ground for his leader. When the 17 powered through the long finishing straight at the start of the third last lap the peloton could see the break ahead. But even the gap of 40 seconds was proving very hard to wear down. Only when the Dutch finally showed their hand did that advantage begin to shrink, just as Pogačar yelled at Tratnik to make another all-out effort &#8211; before blasting off again.</p>\n<p>This time only Pavel Sivakov (France) was able to hold on at first, but even he had to lose Pogačar&#8217;s wheel on the steepest part of the Zurichbergstrasse. Once across the top, though, the Slovenian wisely opted to wait for Sivakov, knowing that even for a giant of the sport like himself, attacking in a Worlds alone with 77 kilometres to go was the most daunting of tasks. The pressure of his repeated attacks, though, was such that in the peloton the </p>\n<p>Belgian team was at the risk of blowing up, with Evenepoel down to just one rider, Maxim van Gils and the Netherlands only chasing with Bauke Mollema. And so the two-hour, almost completely futile, history of trying to chase down a Pogačar on the rampage began, with first Evenepoel hitting the panic button twice in person in quick succession. </p>\n<p>His double move had little effect apart from reducing the chase group to 35 riders, but Pogačar, meanwhile, was steadily maintaining a gap of 45 seconds. That small gap might have been bigger, but the Slovenian&#8217;s constant glances behind meant he knew that fellow breakaway Sivakov could provide some more valuable support for a little longer &#8211; and, equally, that his long-term plan of keeping his pursuers at bay was working out just fine.</p>\n<p>It was not as if the chasers were giving up the ghost completely. Van der Poel put in one acceleration after another and then Evenepoel himself, too, pushed hard on the downhill to try and keep his Worlds hope alight. However, the most promising chase group turned out to be formed by Ben Healy (Ireland), Toms Skujins (Latvia) and Oscar Onley (GB), reducing Pogačar and Sivakov&#8217;s advantage to 40 seconds, with Van der Poel and a visibly frustrated Evenepoel trailing along some 20 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was still arguably too narrow for comfort, though, and certainly not enough for Pogačar to count on much-needed support from a team car. And so it was that with 50.5 kilometres to go when Pogačar simply maintained his pace on the steepest climb of all, the Zurichbergstrasse for Sivakov the pace set down by his trade teammate was just too much, and the longest winning solo breakaway in the World Championships since 1971 began. Yet again &#8211; just like in Strade Bianche, just like in Liège, and just like in the Giro and Tour &#8211; Pogačar was out front alone and in a class of his own.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was brave enough to try at one point to make a lone counter-attack, catching a flagging Onley, while Skujins and Healy were working well together, even sharing bottles in their tenacious pursuit. But while Pogačar still briefly looked concerned and waved an arm after missing one bidon with a gel attached at a feed, even with an hour&#8217;s racing remaining and 220 kilometres in his legs, increasingly it seemed as if he only had himself to beat.</p>\n<p>With 35 kilometres to go, the sense of resignation in the chasers was palpable. Given Pogačar&#8217;s advantage stood at 1:02 as the lap-to-go bell rang out and with no-one showing the remotest sign of putting on a last-minute counter-attack, Pogačar&#8217;s victory felt all but a foregone conclusion. A twist in the tale</p>\n<p>However, there was almost a final twist in the tail of major proportions as on a day with over 4,000 metres of vertical climbing and after a breakaway of historic proportions, even a giant like Pogačar began to struggle slightly on the final lap. There was a second major wobble downwards in his time gap as Marc Hirschi (Switzerland) made a devastating counter-attack and suddenly, just as his triumph had seemed inevitable and for the first time in three hours, Pogačar looked vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Hirschi was joined by Mas, the two then regained contact with Healy and Skujins and their numbers swelled further to Evenepoel, Van der Poel and O&#8217;Connor. Suddenly it was one rider ahead against seven behind and as the gap dropped even further to a nerve-wracking 39 seconds, the Slovenian staff waiting at the finish line began looking increasingly worried Yet for all a fast-recovering Evenepoel continued to chase, on a crucial little kicker on the long last downhill, Pogačar abruptly overcame his tiredness and in a trademark flurry of pedal-turning, opened up his gap to 50 seconds again. </p>\n<p>With that extra time cushion and despite a searing late attack by Skujins and another by Healy, one further factor counted in his favour: behind the hesitations and changes of pace remained a constant, making it much harder for any sustained pursuit. </p>\n<p>So at long last and after one of the most memorable rides in Worlds history, Pogačar could finally celebrate a milestone achievement in the sport, punching the sky in delight as he celebrated his first road race gold medal. Just when it seemed like the Slovenian could not set the bar even higher, he has done so &#8211; and after winning cycling&#8217;s two toughest Grand Tours in a single season, the most arduous, unpredictable, one-day race of them all is now in his palmares as well. ends</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (Belgium) has successfully defended her 2023 rainbow jersey in the elite women&#8217;s road race at the World Championships in Zurich.</p>\n<p>Silver in a ferocious six-rider final bunch that decided the 154-kilometre race was Chloé Dygert (USA), with Italy&#8217;s Elisa Longo Borghini clinching the bronze. Puck Pieterse (Netherlands) claimed the under-23 women&#8217;s world title, finishing 13th from a chasing group at 3:00.</p>\n<p>Raced in atrocious weather conditions, the rain-soaked and demanding Championship was dominated by the Netherlands, with Demi Vollering driving a lead group clear on the final two climbs.</p>\n<p>But despite being in trouble earlier on, Kopecky maintained her calm and, having shadowed Vollering in the finale, remained firmly in contention.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini led out the six-strong sprint for gold, only for Kopecky to come through to become the first rider to claim back-to-back elite women&#8217;s World Championships titles since Marianne Vos in 2012-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kind of disbelief, but first of all I want to pay my condolences to the family of Muriel,&#8221; Kopecky said afterwards, referring to Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died as a result of her injuries incurred in Thursday&#8217;s road race &#8211; and to whom she dedicated her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the minute of silence at the start, seeing the Swiss riders crying, is something you just don&#8217;t want to see. I think it&#8217;s a very hard moment for them as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for the race itself, the defending champion said &#8220;It&#8217;s for sure a win [I took] with my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a really annoying day because it was raining and it wasn&#8217;t warm, but on the climbs it was warm and then in the downhill you got so cold and I was freezing at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But then I tried to stay as calm as possible, on the steeper climb I didn&#8217;t have any troubles and then on the longer one in the final time when Demi went I had some difficulties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I just tried to stay at my own pace and come back and in the end it was just a lot of mind games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then it was just trying to stay as cool as possible and use my energy in the right moment. The Australian rider [Ruby Roseman-Gannon] came from the back, Demi reacted immediately and that was perfect for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe tragic loss of Furrer has left &#8211; and will leave &#8211;  an indelible mark on these World Championships and as Kopecky said, before the race a minute&#8217;s silence was held to honour the memory of the 18-year-old, with the Swiss team assembled at the front of the peloton underneath the starting gantry. </p>\n<p>Swiss rider Noemi Ruegg surely echoed the thoughts of many when she told Eurosport before the race, &#8220;We worked hard for this, we are trying to do our best and we will race with Muriel in our hearts and we will see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the flag dropped, a three-rider attack quickly formed in the incessant rain, containing Caroline Baur (Switzerland), Sara Martin (Spain) and Nina Berton (Luxembourg). Coming through the finish on the first of four 26.8-kilometre laps, the trio held an advantage of 30 seconds over a lead group already reduced to around half of the 198 starters. Baur and Martin both struggled on the toughest ramps of the painfully irregular Bergstrasse that almost immediately followed, though, leaving Berton ploughing a lone pathway ahead, and one which quickly fizzled out.</p>\n<p>The race&#8217;s next significant development came some 100 kilometres from the line thanks to a dangerous nine-strong move, sparked by Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) and Niamh Fisher-Black (New Zealand) with Sara Gigante (Australia), Soraya Paladin (Italy), Urska Zigart (Slovenia), Justine Ghekiere (Belgium), Elena Hartmann (Switzerland), Christine Majerus (Luxembourg) and Mie Bjorndal Ottestad (Norway) all following. Then when Franziska Koch (Germany) and Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands) bridged across, with so many top nations present, the move looked even more promising. But the grim reality was the absence of France, Spain and Poland meant it was hard for the 11 to gain any traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, a concerted pursuit by the Netherlands both reabsorbed the break and saw 2021 World Champion Elisa Balsamo squeezed out the back. Another stand-out name, Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (France), was also already struggling. The key lesson from this early skirmishing, either way, was that the Dutch were planning to make the running, be it in creating breakaways or ruthlessly crushing them.</p>\n<p>As the rain teemed down relentlessly, the all-powerful Dutch &#8211; still with all seven riders present on the front at the halfway point &#8211;  continued to use their strength in depth to play the numbers game in support of leader Vollering. Mischa Bredewold was merciless when it came to squeezing down the bunch in the brutal conditions to 50 riders, three-times road rainbow jersey Marianne Vos and Riejanne Markus then took over and next Pauliena Rooijakkers continued to pile on the pain.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to matter when top Dutch names like Vos were showing signs of being in trouble, Vollering herself upped the pace on the second last lap of the race, and her relentless rhythm fleetingly reduced the front group to around a dozen.  Even when Vollering was not closing down attacks in person, her teammates Markus and Pieterse seemed permanently poised to close down any other moves. Nobody, it seemed, could escape the orange team&#8217;s clutches.</p>\n<p><strong>Change of tactics</strong><br />\nThe Dutch seemingly switched from their clampdown tactics, though, when Markus bolted away with only Tour de France mountains classification winner Justine Ghekiere (Belgium) in her wake. In theory, this would force the remaining contenders to chase. In practice, though, a ferocious and somewhat inexplicable acceleration by Vos, then Bredevold and Pieterse reduced their teammate Markus&#8217; and Gheikiere&#8217;s advantage to 25 seconds. </p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (Switzerland) then took over on a long, rain-soaked descent, allowing the seemingly indefatigable Vos to bridge across the much-reduced gap alongside Ruby Roseman-Gannon (Australia). Vos and Markus did take turns from thereon as they powered towards the finish line for a second last time, once again putting their rivals&#8217; ability to respond under severe scrutiny, as Vollering watched and waited. But would a gap of four riders of nearly a minute as the lap-to-go bell rang out prove to be enough?</p>\n<p>The answer came quickly enough as Markus continued to drive for Vos on the steeper segments of the Bergstrasse, while Vollering controlled the chasers all the way through to the fast drop down to the second main climb of the Wetzikon. Finally, a powerful acceleration by Liane Lippert (Germany) singlehandedly reduced the gap to a bridgable 35 seconds and five riders moved ahead: Kopecky, Chloé Dygert (USA), Kopecky, Longo Borghini, Vollering and Lippert herself.</p>\n<p>Having flown under the radar for so long, Longo Borghini then made a ferociously long acceleration, only for Vollering to reply. Kopecky, though could not answer and was left trailing to the point where it seemed like her options on a second World Championships title were completely lost.</p>\n<p>As Kopecky found a second wind, Vollering opened up the throttle in earnest, but her determination was quickly matched by Longo Borghini, with Roseman-Gannon emphatically shaking her head as she was invited to come through.  Meanwhile, a colossal effort by Chloé Dygert allowed her to regain contact at 14 kilometres to go as the small lead group ploughed through a flooded segment of road. Then in a race with multiple plot changes, a revived Kopecky also recovered enough to regain contact alongside Vos and Markus, making the Dutch the majority once again in a nine-rider group, but with their key rival present, too.</p>\n<p>On the second last climb of the day, a vicious little kicker 10 kilometres, anybody without a sprint in their legs simply had to make a move and Vollering ripped away at the highest speed possible. However, her move simply eliminated her teammates and Ghekiere and reduced the front group to six, while Kopecky&#8217;s turn of speed on the descent ensured that it stayed that way. </p>\n<p>A final drag before the three-kilometre flat run-in alongside Lake Zurich briefly pushed Roseman-Gannon and Dygert out of the running and Longo Borghini did her utmost with a sustained late attack to ensure she kept the group at four. However, Vollering&#8217;s driving response tilted the battle back in favour of the chasers again, and then the last-minute arrival of Dygert and Roseman-Gannon, almost in the final kilometre, made it six riders in search of three medals. </p>\n<p>Perhaps knowing she was the weakest in a sprint, Roseman-Gannon began the charge for the line, only for Vollering to storm past. After her uneven race, though, a veteran track expert like Kopecky was now in her element on the flat finale, and she blasted through the centre of the tiny pack of riders to reclaim her rainbow jersey once again.</p>\n<p>While Kopecky made it clear that she had raced as much with her head as her legs on a difficult and uneven day, the USA also had considerable reason to celebrate, claiming their first silver medal in the event since Inga Thompson in 1991. After all their efforts, the Dutch, on the other hand, suffered a notable defeat with Vollering in fifth, even if gold for Puck Pieterse in the U23 category in the same event subsequently provided a significant consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>Niklas Behrens (Germany) scored the rainbow jersey in the U23 men’s road race the UCI Road World Championships, outpacing Martin Svrček (Slovakia) in a two-man sprint to the line in Zürich.</p>\n<p>The pair proved the strongest men from a select chase group behind long-distance solo attacker Jan Christen (Switzerland), who attacked alone 51km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Behind Christen, a group including Behrens, Svrček, Jarno Widar (Belgium), Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) and Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain) formed after an attack from Widar, with the Belgian and his team responsible for much of the pacemaking behind the lone leader.</p>\n<p>On the final lap, Widar was once again leading the way and bringing the chase to within sight of Christen, at which point Behrens launched a powerful uphill attack. His jump at 11km to go brought both him and Svrček across to Christen, with a second jump dispatching the Swiss rider for good.</p>\n<p>Behrens and Svrček were off at the front, distancing the rest and extending their advantage past the 50-second mark before hitting the final kilometres and contesting the gold and silver medals.</p>\n<p>It was Svrček who led out the sprint, with Behrens lurking until the final 150 metres before launching. The German’s power was too much for his Slovakian rival, netting him the rainbow jersey as U23 world champion.</p>\n<p>Christen, caught by the chase group behind 6km out, would eventually salvage fourth place at 39 seconds down having chased a late attack by Alec Segaert (Belgium). He had bridged across to the chase before quickly attacking solo 2km from the finish to secure the bronze medal, 28 seconds behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>The riders were unaware that 18-year-old Swiss rider Muriel Furrer died from the injuries she sustained in her Thursday crash during the junior women’s road because the UCI and the Zurich Worlds organising committee made the announcement during their race. </p>\n<p>Before the podium ceremony, a moment of silence was held, while flags were positioned at half mast in Muriel Furrer&#8217;s honour.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 173.6km race set the riders the same challenging circuit that has been contested at the other road races this week, with a 40km flat start giving way to four full laps of a hilly circuit around Zürich.</p>\n<p>One climb of Binz (1.5km at 9.3%) and four ascents of Witikon (1.4km at 7.1%) proved the main challenges of the day, though numerous other hills and rises peppered the route, which totalled 2,400 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>Three riders attacked on the flat run to start the race, with Cole Kessler (United States), Lewis Bower (New Zealand) and Robert Donaldson (Great Britain) jumping away to a minute advantage as they entered the hilly finishing circuit for the first time.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Alastair Mackellar (Australia) attempted to bridge across, making a move at 125km out. He was caught in between the leaders and the peloton, however, before dropping back at the 120km mark.</p>\n<p>The three-man break out front wouldn’t last much longer, either, meaning the race crossed the finish line for the first time, with 108km left to run, with a slimmed-down peloton leading the way.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, on the climb up towards Witikon, Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) launched a stinging attack along with William Junior Lecerf (Belgium), though that would come to nothing. Attempts by Christen, Callum Thornley (Great Britain) and Artem Schmidt (United States) also gained little traction.</p>\n<p>The next time around, with just under 80km left to run, it was the turn of Antonio Morgado (Portugal) and Davide De Pretto (Italy) to try a move. Their unsuccessful break attempt was followed by the likes of Christen, again, as well as Tibor Del Grosso (Netherlands) and Giulio Pellizzari (Italy).</p>\n<p>However, a move wouldn’t stick until Christen tried for a third time, again on the uphill run to Witikon. At 51km from the finish he managed to get a gap on his rivals, striking out with just under two laps left to run.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the elite chase group that would be chasing him for much of the remainder of the race formed. Belgian riders Segaert and Lecerf had Jarno Widar, Robin Orins and Emiel Verstrynge for company in the group, along with Behrens, Svrček, Del Toro, Pellizzari, Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain), Darren Rafferty (Ireland) and Spanish pair Igor Arrieta and Ivan Romeo.</p>\n<p>Pellizzari decided to venture out alone in the chase as Belgium unsurprisingly controlled the larger group. The Italian was brought back with 33km to go, while the group crossed the finish line to start the final lap 45 seconds behind Christen.</p>\n<p>It was the Belgians who had held the lone leader close by, and it was their man Widar who took the initiative on the final ascent to Witkon with a big move at the front. He took Svrček and Segaert with him, though Del Toro, Blackmore and Del Grosso quickly made it across the gap.</p>\n<p>At the top of the hill, 20km from the line, Segaert and Del Grosso let go, while the work of Belgium and Widar had brought Christen’s advantage down to just 20 seconds. 18-year-old Widar continued to do much of the work in the chase, dragging the group to within sight of Christen as they raced into the final 15km.</p>\n<p>It was those who had kept more in reserve for the final who made the big moves, though, with Behrens and Svrček powering past and across to Christen’s wheel 11km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Upon making the catch, Behrens immediately jumped again, distancing Christen as Svrček stuck to his wheel. The pair would continue on to the finish, building their advantage up to almost a minute at one point before slowing in the final kilometre and contesting the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>Behind, Christen was caught by Widar, Blackmore and Del Toro with 6km to run, while a resurgent Segaert chased across and immediately went over the top 2km out. That move, coming after a brief rest in the wheels, was enough to push on secure bronze after the hard work of the Belgian squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Finn (Italy) soloed to the men&#8217;s junior road race world title in grim conditions in Zürich, racing home from 20km out to score his nation’s first rainbow jersey of the UCI Road World Championships.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) secured the silver medal, crossing the line 2:05 after Finn. He rode solo for the final 13km of the race having dropped fellow chaser Héctor Álvarez (Spain).</p>\n<p>Álvarez, who was going backwards since being left behind by Finn’s winning move, was caught and passed by a small chase group in the closing kilometres, missing out on bronze in the process.</p>\n<p>Instead, the battle for third came down to a sprint between Senna Remijn (Netherlands), Paul Fietzke (Germany) and Ashlin Barry (United States), with the trio finishing in that order at 3:06 down. Álvarez, meanwhile, crossed the line in sixth 3:44 adrift of Finn.</p>\n<p>“It still hasn’t sunk in, to be honest. It still feels like a dream,” Finn said after the finish.</p>\n<p>“I felt amazing today, probably the best legs I’ve ever had. When I went on my own the first time with 60km to go I was like ‘Oh, this might be a bit early’. But then Philipsen and a few other guys bridged to me, and I just wanted to go full on the climb.</p>\n<p>“Albert crashed behind me and I hope he’s OK. But once I was on my own, I knew I had it in the bag because I was feeling amazing.</p>\n<p>“I usually don’t like the rain, to be honest. I like 35 and sunny. But today was perfect.”</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Finn – reigning Italian junior road race and time trial champion – had been at the head of affairs for 70km of the 127km race, 23km of it alone before he was brought back into an elite lead group 37km out.</p>\n<p>With the pouring rain and the hilly circuit taking their toll on the riders, the group whittled down until just four remained out front to contest the final. Only bad luck would intervene, too, with reigning champion Albert Withen Philipsen (Denmark) crashing out on a soaked corner 22km from home.</p>\n<p>That left Finn and Álvarez in the lead, but Finn, who had already spent plenty of energy in a solo move, had yet more left in the tank and dispatched with the Spaniard to race on alone into rainbows.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior men’s road race would take the peloton on a 127.2km journey from Uster to Zürich, traversing 1,800 metres of climbing along the way. As in the junior women’s race, the climbs of Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) were the only major obstacles on the route, though the men would have to contend with three ascents of Witikon, taking them through the finish line three times before the crowning of the new world champion.</p>\n<p>The early stage of the race was, unsurprisingly, marked by numerous attacks as those from smaller nations – including Azerbaijan – attempted to get away. It was also marked by several crashes, including a sizeable one which caught out time trial silver medallist Jasper Schoofs (Belgium).</p>\n<p>The high pace of the start continued for 30km to Binz and past the day’s opening climb, with no breakaway establishing itself at the front as a result. Already just inside the 90km to go mark, the peloton had been obliterated, leaving only around 20 or so men in front.</p>\n<p>Attacks came and went on the approach to Witikon, including from Lorenzo Finn (Italy), Paul Fietzke (Germany), and Héctor Álvarez (Spain), leading the peloton to reduce in size once again.</p>\n<p>By this point, with 70km to go, names including time trial world champion Paul Seixas (France), reigning road world champion Albert Within Philipsen (Denmark), Matisse Van Kerckhove (Belgium), Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) – plus Finn, Fietzke and Álvarez – were in the move.</p>\n<p>Withen Philipsen, Seixas and Van Kerckhove all gave it a nudge following the climb to Witikon, though none would get away. Instead, it was Finn who broke clear with an attack 60km out.</p>\n<p>On the way up to Witikon for the second time, Finn had gained 20 seconds, whereas the attacks and counters behind provoked another split. This time, Withen Philipsen, Seixas, Alvarez, Grindley and Senna Remijn (Netherlands) made the cut, leaving the rest of the group behind in pursuit of the lone leader.</p>\n<p>Finn held out well, however, maintaining a 25-second lead over the top of the climb and into the final 45km, while the dropped chasers lagged behind at 1:10. He held out until the 37km mark at least, at which point Withen Philipsen, Grindley and Álvarez bridged across having left behind Seixas and Remijn.</p>\n<p>With four in the lead versus two behind, the mathematics of the situation was always going to in favour of the quartet out front. So, it proved as they added second after second to their lead, crossing the finish line for the penultimate time 26km from home with a 35-seconds lead over the chase.</p>\n<p>The situation was quickly becoming even more positive for them, too, as Seixas struggled to keep up with Remijn. That seemed to liberate the Dutchman, if anything, as he swiftly set about closing the gap on the final run to Witikon.</p>\n<p>Now 25 seconds up the road, the lead group was busy blowing apart as Finn led Withen Philipsen then Álvarez, then Grindley on the short climb before Witikon. But the Dane’s race, and a chance at another rainbow jersey, was soon brought to an abrupt end as he crashed out on a wet corner.</p>\n<p>The fall left plenty of what-ifs about the race, and it also left Álvarez up with Finn in the lead with Grindley, Remijn and Seixas chasing one-by-one behind. That state of affairs didn’t last long either, for at the 20km mark Finn was off again, the Italian leaving Alvarez behind in search of victory.</p>\n<p>Finn was on a mission, his advantage swiftly ballooning out past a minute as he hit the 16km mark. Álvarez was struggling, and he soon had Grindley for company in a battle for silver. The pair would have to work together to hold off Remijn, but Grindley wasn’t content with a two-man battle for silver.</p>\n<p>Instead, he went for it on his own 13km from the line, with Álvarez unable to offer any resistance to the decisive silver medal move. Little would be seen of the Spaniard or the chase behind on the final run into Zürich, but he wouldn’t hang on for the final medal placing. Instead dropping back behind Remijn, Fietzke and Ashlin Barry (United States), who sprinted it out for third.</p>\n<p>The day was Finn’s though, the Italian racing home with a mammoth two-minute gap, having clearly proved himself as the strongest man on the day and rounding off his efforts with the rainbow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=233&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=233&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>Cat Ferguson (Great Britain) added the junior women’s road race world title to the time trial rainbow jersey she won earlier this week at the UCI Road World Championships, prevailing in a tense three-woman sprint at the end of the 73.5km race in Zürich.</p>\n<p>The 18-year-old, who turns pro with Movistar next season, outsprinted Paula Ortiz (Spain) and Viktória Chladoňová  (Slovakia) inside the final 200 metres after the Spaniard had opened the sprint to draw an end to over a kilometre of poker playing.<br />\n&#8220;I&#8217;m over the moon. The road race is the thing I&#8217;ve always wanted. Ever since last year, second place really hurt, so to get gold is incredible,&#8221; Ferguson said after the race, referring back to her silver medal in the Glasgow Worlds last summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was conscious that I didn&#8217;t know how big the gap was. I had a good gap of a minute and a half with 5km to go but I knew that we slowed so much because nobody wanted to be on the front. So I kept looking back to check we weren&#8217;t going to get caught.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race is so different [from the time trial and I focus so much on the road. I love the TT bike, but the road is the one I always wanted. It feels even better than Tuesday, which is insane to say because Tuesday was incredible.&#8221;<br />\nThe trio had been all set to contest the medal placings from the 20km to go marker, when they split away from a select lead group on the second and final major climb of the race, the Witikon.</p>\n<p>Clearly the strongest three women on the road, they steadily extended their gap over the chasers as they raced back towards Zürich, sticking together on the soaking roads to the finish and finally enjoying an advantage of well over a minute.</p>\n<p>The final two kilometres brought caginess, checking over shoulders and cat-and-mouse games, but with plenty of time in hand, the trio could afford the slowdown. In the end, though, the final result was no surprise, with Ferguson duly outspeeding her two competitors for her second 2024 World Championships gold.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, having launched the sprint first, but only just hung on to take silver, edging out Chladonova by centimetres at the line. Fourth place was taken by Megan Arens (Netherlands) at just nine seconds down, the 17-year-old having used those final kilometres to close much of the minute-plus gap from the chasers on her own.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior women’s road race at the Road World Championships would see the peloton tackle a hilly 73.5km course from Uster to Zürich. Two major climbs marked the route – Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) – while the closing section was run on one-and-a-half laps of a closing circuit around the finish city.<br />\nThe race got underway in damp weather, though the conditions didn’t prevent riders from going on the attack early on.</p>\n<p>A breakaway wouldn’t go clear for 16km, however, at which point a group of five raced off the front. Arabella Blackburn (Great Britain) was joined in the lead by Nina Lavenu (France), Italian pair Eleonora La Bella and Silvia Milesi, and Weronika Wasaty (Poland).</p>\n<p>The move was kept on a tight leash by the peloton and the quintet would only last around 10km on the front before being brought back with 47km to run. Not long after that, a new group of attackers made a break for it as eight riders moved clear.<br />\nJunior time trial champion Cat Ferguson (Great Britain) was up there and she was joined by La Bella, her Italian teammate Giada Silo, Célia Gery (France), Megan Arens (Netherlands), Ostiz, Kamilla Aasebø (Norway), and Chladoňová .</p>\n<p>The group only held a slender lead of the peloton – not more than 20 seconds – meaning that chasers stood a chance of making it across.</p>\n<p>Imogen Wolff (Great Britain) and Eirini Papadimitriou (Greece) were among those to strike out from the chase, eventually bridging the gap as the race crossed the finish line for the first time at 27km to go.</p>\n<p>Their move made it nine up front, with La Bella having previously dropped away, likely the result of having been in two breakaway moves. The attacking and bridging all proved to be in vain, however, with the break and reduced peloton reunited at the 25km mark.</p>\n<p>On the uphill road towards Witikon, the Dutch team assumed control at the front, though it would prove impossible to stave off further attacks.</p>\n<p>Those moves saw a small group go clear at the front once more, with Ferguson and Wolff again up there along with Gery, Arens, Ostiz, Chladonová, and Silo.</p>\n<p>Wolff and Gery wouldn’t stick up front over the top of Witikon, though, and neither would Arens or Silo, as the trio of Ferguson, Ostiz and Chladonová pushed on ahead past the 20km marker.</p>\n<p>Pursued by Gery, Arens and Silo, the leading break quickly drew out an advantage of 40 seconds with 15 kilometres to go, while the next group on the road lay well out of contention at 1:30 down.</p>\n<p>It looked increasingly as though the lead group would contest the rainbow jersey and the medal placings among themselves, a prospect that was surely beyond doubt at the 10km mark, where the trio had over a minute in the bank.</p>\n<p>With 6km to run, at the end of the descent from the plateau following Witikon, they were 1:30 clear and ready to start thinking about the rainbow jersey. There was no poker from that far out, though, with the cat-and-mouse games not coming until they hit the 2km mark.</p>\n<p>There was constant checking over shoulders heading under the flamme rouge, with Arens having gone solo from the chase behind. There was little to worry about, however, with the rainbows all but assured for one of the leading trio.</p>\n<p>Ostiz and then Ferguson took to the front during the glacially paced final kilometre, but it was the Spanish 17-year-old who launched the sprint for the line first, just inside the 200-metre mark.</p>\n<p>Ferguson wasn’t caught out by the early jump, however, and was the first to react. Her closing speed proved more than enough to hold off Ortiz and the trailing Viktória Chladoňová to secure her second rainbow jersey of the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>A nail-bitingly tight three-way battle in the Road World Championships mixed relay team time trial on Wednesday saw Australia claim the victory by less than a second over Germany, with Italy clinching bronze, just eight seconds further behind.</p>\n<p>When the three top nations&#8217; riders entered the final quarter of an extremely long, remorselessly rugged course running across the hills around Zurich, they were still only separated by a scant five seconds in Australia&#8217;s favour.</p>\n<p>A last-ditch effort by Grace Brown, already a winner of the World&#8217;s individual time trial last Saturday and teammate Brodie Chapman then just managed to keep Australia atop of the results table by the finish by the tiniest of margins.</p>\n<p>Bronze medallists in 2023, Germany had the consolation of going one better in 2024 with silver, while Italy fell off the pace slightly in the final kilometre to finish eight seconds down and complete the podium &#8211;  but still well ahead of fourth-placed France, 23 seconds back, in one of the most dramatic TTs in recent Worlds history.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling a bit greedy, I need a few more rainbow jerseys in my closet,&#8221; Brown joked afterwards as she added a second World Championships title to the one she took last weekend, &#8220;but this one&#8217;s really got a nice vibe, to do it with the whole Aussie crew. It&#8217;s really exciting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s teammate Michael Matthews added, &#8220;It was a hard one. I think Jay [Vine] put me to the sword on that first climb, I think we averaged about 650 Watts from bottom to top, so it was a hard day and there was not much recovery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we had to stick together as much as possible and keep our speed as high as possible. We came through with the fastest time [at the first checkpoint] and then we knew we had a really strong women&#8217;s team to finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Team Time Trial Mixed Relay is a relatively new event, offering a chance for men and women to compete together, even if they ride in different moments, first as a trio of men and then as a trio of women. The times of the two teams are combined to decide the final results.</p>\n<p>Mongolia were the first of the 18 teams to get the ball rolling on the very selective, unforgiving 53.7-kilometre course, by far the longest in the Mixed Relay&#8217;s five-year history, and featuring nearly 1,000 metres of vertical climbing. Nearly all of the first wave of 10 squads immediately began losing riders as soon as the men tackled the short, punchy first ascent, the Witikonerstrasse, with Mohamed Islam Jorat and Qais Haidari (Afghanistan) both dropping behind teammate Ahmad Mirzaye. Mirzaye then had his own share of problems when he crashed through a fence, fortunately without injuries.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China&#8217;s Lyu Xianging was visibly undecided about having to wait for compatriot Chengshuo Miao &#8211; which he eventually did &#8211;  and two Algerian riders had some sort of an on-bike disagreement about their lack of collaboration. Regardless of the course, on a difficult course, any such divisions, be they verbal or physical, inevitably came at a high price time-wise &#8211; and just as well it wasn&#8217;t raining. </p>\n<p>After the women&#8217;s half of the teams took over, China&#8217;s early best time of 1:23:39 was rapidly demolished by Ukraine, with a stunning result of 1:19:52. Only Estonia, 1:29 back, came anywhere close to their central European rivals, meaning Ukraine&#8217;s time was destined to stand as the initial target to beat for the second half of the competition. </p>\n<p>When the second, final, wave of eight teams began rolling down the ramps, despite losing Jonas Walton, Canada quickly upped the game at the first checkpoint (km11) with a provisional best time of 17:05 &#8211;  exactly a minute faster than Estonia. A super-strong USA trio including recent Vuelta a España TT winner Brandon McNulty then pushed it even higher to 16:39, but the biggest hitters proved to be Germany, who went a full nine seconds faster, with Italy and Australia slotting in just behind.</p>\n<p>Double defending champion Switzerland suffered a major setback when Johan Jacobs was dropped less than five minutes into racing, almost certainly ruling them out of the medal battle. The German men, on the other hand, continued to go from strength to strength, blasting home in their half of the course in a top mark of 34:06 &#8211; only for a massive turn by Michael Matthews along the finishing straight in downtown Zurich to see Australia clock an even more impressive time of 33:44. </p>\n<p>Then there was yet more excitement as Italy pushed their way between Germany and leaders Australia, finishing just seven seconds down as their women&#8217;s trio of Elisa Longo Borghini, Soraya Paladin, and Gaia Realini took over. Gold then, was by no means out of reach for any of the first three teams atop of the results board at the half-way point, with France, just a second slower than Germany at the half-way point, still very much a medal contender as well.</p>\n<p>Fifth at the mid-way point, the USA women briefly claimed top time at checkpoint 3 (km 33) with a fine 54:28. But their time was kicked out of the park by Germany with 53:17, a massive 1:11 ahead, and despite losing Ruby Roseman-Gannon early on a climb, Australia steadied their own ship, too, to go five seconds faster.  Italy were only two seconds down on Australia, though, ensuring it would be a three-horse race for gold all the way to the line. France&#8217;s women, however, faded notably, leaving the podium &#8211; if not the order &#8211; all but decided.</p>\n<p>At the finish line, Germany blasted home at 1:12:53, more than two minutes ahead of the previous best Denmark. But it remained uncertain if that would be good enough to stand on top of the podium. Australia&#8217;s Brown and Chapman were giving it their all, though, on the flat final run-in that had already proved so critical to the men&#8217;s team effort, they just inched the German squad out of the top spot. It seemed incredible that there should be less than a second&#8217;s difference after such a tough 53-kilometre course between the top two teams, but the results board told a different story. But the cliffhanger finale had yet to reach a conclusion, as with a kilometre to go, TV images showed the Italians were still only a second behind the Australians.</p>\n<p>With their teammates and rivals all silently glued to the TV screens at the finish, as Italian duo Elisa Borghini and Gaia Realini closed in on the line, the tension could hardly have been any higher.  In the last 200 metres, though, the clock shifted in favour of the Australians and Germans, meaning the Italian team had to settle for bronze  &#8211; and a hugely entertaining time trial medals battle with the most uncertain of outcomes had finally been decided.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Although Kazakhsan&#8217;s Mariya Yelkina soon outstripped her by a second, both their times were eclipsed by the performance of Viktória Chladoňová who produced a stunning provisional best time of 24:24. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do TT training very often, so it was a big surprise for me,&#8221; the Slovakian, recently a European TT medallist who also practices MTB and cyclo-cross, said afterwards. But her time proved to be more than enough to earn her a medal finish all the same. </p>\n<p>Despite going the fastest by a sixth of a second at the turn (km 9.4), a disappointed Imogen Wolf (GB) subsequently narrowly missed out on the Slovakian&#8217;s time, finishing two seconds behind after her power meter failed to work properly. Rider after rider then failed to impact on either time set by the Slovakian and Briton, even if several of the key favourites were yet to start. </p>\n<p>Double Dutch National TT Champion Fee Knaven fired a warning shot across their bows with the second best time at the turn, but she faded in the second half &#8211; eventually settling for fourth. However, it was a very different story for Britain&#8217;s Cat Ferguson, the last rider to start and widely viewed as a top contender. Already 14 seconds up on Chladoňová at the time split, Ferguson then more than doubled that advantage to continue her blistering final season as a Junior with a definitive winning margin of over 34 seconds -well clear of the rest of the field.</p>\n<p>Later explaining her stunning TT performance, Ferguson said one key to success on a course with just 36 metres of elevation gain was that she had maintained her pacing strategy throughout.   </p>\n<p>&#8220;I had my ride, stuck to the plan, it was a bit windier than I thought, I was getting blown around a little bit, so I tried to keep my head down as much as possible,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kept to a set of Watts and tried to do it throughout, going out was as hard as on the way back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ferguson also paid tribute to those who helped her claim her first Junior Worlds title, saying  &#8220;It was helpful to have my coach in my ear, guiding me through and having someone there to support you and back you is so nice.&#8221; Then when she reached the finish line with the gold medal a certainty, her parents were there to greet her as well. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been there throughout my career, so to have them here today was great,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Ferguson is now set to start her first full pro season with Movistar in 2025, but with her TT triumph as one of her final Junior successes, her morale will surely be higher than ever as she embarks on the next stage of an already very promising career.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechseläutenplatz).</p>\n<p>Iván Romeo (Spain) pulled out a spectacular final 9.4 kilometres to win the men&#8217;s under-23 individual time trial world championship race on Monday.</p>\n<p>Romeo was 20 seconds behind Switzerland&#8217;s Jan Christen at the first check atop a gradual climb but made up time on the undulating middle section to close to within two seconds. Then, Romeo blasted through the flat final section to win the rainbow jersey by 41 seconds.</p>\n<p>Jakob Soderqvist (Sweden) also saved his bullets for the final stretch and cruised in for the silver medal at 32 seconds behind the Spaniard, coming in ahead of Christen by eight seconds.</p>\n<p>The home country had to settle for bronze as Christen&#8217;s time held even in the face of a stiff challenge from last year&#8217;s runner-up Alec Segaert (Belgium), who was quickest at the second check but then imploded in the final and finished fourth.</p>\n<p>Romeo called the victory, &#8220;the happiest day of my life&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked so hard for this,&#8221; Romeo said. &#8220;Few people know how bad I wanted this, only my close ones and my friends, my family. I&#8217;ve been here for 10 days with my father here in Zurich, seeing the parcours.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I like the distance, I like the climb. It was pretty good for me, but you never know. At the beginning of the day it was raining for me, some descents were wet, so even having the best time when I arrived, I thought they were gonna be faster.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I pushed so hard in the last 10k &#8211; my pacing was meant to be like that, but I did not expect to have that power at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Paul Lomulia (Uganda) set the quickest early time but was soon eclipsed by Mateusz Gajdulewicz (Poland), but Isaac del Toro (Mexico) was flying and came through more than a minute faster than the Pole.</p>\n<p>Portugal&#8217;s Antonio Morgado was well behind his trade teammate at the second check and faded in the final section, dropping behind Matthias Schwarzbacher (Slovakia) to come third-fastest at the finish.</p>\n<p>Behind, Adam Rafferty (Ireland) and Christen were quicker than Del Toro at the first check by 22 and 34 seconds, respectively. Soon after, Romeo slotted in second-fastest at the first check and then surpassed Christen at the second check by a single second.</p>\n<p>Rafferty came through at the finish six seconds quicker than Del Toro and hot on his heels, Christen motored across the line a full 37 seconds faster. But the Swiss rider could only watch as Romeo came past 41 seconds ahead, having made up a huge margin in less than 10km.</p>\n<p>Also making up time was Segaert, who came through the second check with the quickest time, five seconds ahead of Romeo. Soderqvist made up time in the final phase to move into second overall at 32 seconds.</p>\n<p>It was only up to Segaert to see if he could get onto the podium but he faded into fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=46&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=46&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He celebrated with his family and young son. He admitted that he lost his chain with three hundred metres to go but recovered in time to launch his winning sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;My chain came off with three hundred metres to go and I thought it was over. But I got going, found a gap and came out of the bunch at the right moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier confirmed that Belgium had a two-sprinter strategy because he was confident he could win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked to be in the race because I believed I could win the championship. I did it and I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This jersey means a lot, after twice being the Belgian national champion. I said it was my last goal of the year.

I had two hard crashes in the last two weeks but I kept believing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it infolded<br />\nThe riders signed on under a timid Belgian September sun, noticing that there was little wind. The sprinters were the happiest about the conditions, sensing their chances of a bunch sprint had increased, but they also feared that the climbs and cobbles of the 222.7km race around the Limburg lanes could shake up the race.</p>\n<p>The riders rolled out of the shadows of the Heusden-Zolder velodrome at speed, with Mathis Le Berre (France), Jonas Rutsch (Germany), Ivo Oliveira (Portugal), Nils Brun (Switzerland) and Félix Ritzinger (Austria) soon forming the early break.</p>\n<p>France put Rémi Cavagna on the front to chase and Le Berre was soon ordered to sit on. That angered the riders in the break, with Oliveira shouting to Le Berre to drop back and other riders trying to gap him.</p>\n<p>The four plus Le Berre pushed on on the short laps of Hasselt but so did the peloton, with other nations putting a rider on the front to ensure the break never gained more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>The work of Cavagna reduced the gap to a minute as the attackers started the Printhagendreef cobbles, the first of nine sectors after 85km. The Op de Kriezel cobbles came soon after and had more of an effect. Ritzinger was dropped from the attack as Le Burre and France changed their tactics, deciding to ride and force other teams to chase.</p>\n<p>With 113km to go, the race twisted again and the final opened up early when Mathieu van der Poel made his first move. He surged away on an exposed sector and suddenly it was &#8216;race on!&#8217;</p>\n<p>Matteo Trentin joined him to defend Italy&#8217;s interests, as did other riders and Dutch teammate Mike Teunissen. They soon caught the break but the peloton soon caught them to bring the race back together. Van der Poel soon went again, trying to make for a hard race but he was marked each time, as the riders covered the first of three rolling and cobbled circuits.</p>\n<p>With 87km to go, on the Op de Kriezel cobbles, van der Poel went again and was again marked by Trentin. Mikkel Bjerg was also there for Denmark, while at the back, Tim Merlier had to chase after a puncture and roadside wheel change.</p>\n<p>After ten kilometres, a quality group of chasers joined the van der Poel group to form a dangerous attack. Kasper Asgreen and Bjerg were there with Pedersen and so they drove the pace, knowing the Belgians were absent. More chasers and more attacks came, as the hilly circuit and cobbles inspired real Classics racing.</p>\n<p>Next time up the Kolmontberg climb, Teunissen accelerated from the attack and Pedersen and Trentin joined him. Van der Poel wanted to be part of the action but missed the move, fortunately other riders closed the gap. The race came back together once again and Italy tried to control the peloton but more attacks came on the Op de Kriezel cobbled sector as the riders began the last lap of the circuit in south Limburg.</p>\n<p>With 55 km to go, Pedersen made another attack to try to split the peloton. Van der Poel jumped in with him again and so did Christophe Laporte of France and Danny van Poppel of the Netherlands. They did not want to wait for a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>However, Italy clearly did. Eduardo Affini used his time trial skills and domestique&#8217;s speed to chase, calling for Germany and Belgium to help him. There was suddenly only 50 km to race and only 50 or so riders in the peloton due to the intense and fast racing.</p>\n<p>In the attack were Mathieu van der Poel and Danny van Poppel (Netherlands), Christophe Laporte (France), Mads Pedersen (Denmark), Jonas Rutsch (Germany) and Arthur Kluckers (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>They gave their all but Italy and Belgium combined to drive the chase, pegging the gap at 15 seconds, with France and the Netherlands sitting in their wheels, watching and waiting.</p>\n<p>The break and the peloton powered over the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg climbs, with Affini and Maestri pulling for Italy and Teuns and Laurenz Rez for Belgium. A crash split the peloton just before the Printhagendreef cobbled sector but the catch finally came with 26km to go, the chances of a high-speed sprint finish becoming more certain.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Italian team took control of the peloton to set the pace and dissuade other attacks on the ride to the finish.</p>\n<p>There were seven Azzurri on the front, only Mosca absent after working a lot earlier in the race. However, also waiting for a sprint finish were Olav Kooij (Netherlands), Alexander Kristoff (Norway), Arnaud Démare (France), Jasper Philipsen (Belgium) and Tim Merlier (Belgium) in the 53-rider group.</p>\n<p>The riders passed through the finish with 14.2km to go, with Germany and France moving up to the front. There was a moment of calm before the sprint. Kasper Asgreen tried a solo attack and the Dane was allowed to hang out front, only to be swept up with five kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Søren Kragh Andersen then tried again for Denmark but Italy and especially Affini quickly chased him down. It was sprint time!</p>\n<p>Italy led out the sprint but seemed to lack a final acceleration. The Dutch train moved up to position Kooj with two kilometres to go on a wide section of road.</p>\n<p>Matteo Trentin led into the final kilometre and then Mattia Cattaneo took over in the final kilometre but the Italians were suddenly swamped before Simone Consonni could drag Milan clear for a run to the line.</p>\n<p>Philipsen surged along the barriers and looked in the perfect position to win. Yet he lacked power and his Belgian rival Merlier surged past on the outside to win the sprint and so take the European title and pull on the distinctive European champion&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4019&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4019&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But the eight-rider Dutch team pulled to the front of the peloton, slashing the gap in half on the flat circuit, and then caught Martin with 12km to go.</p>\n<p>The Dutch riders led the field into the final kilometres of the race with a lead-out that hit speeds of over 53 km/h.

Frenchman Léandre Lozouet rounded out the podium to take the bronze medal 10 seconds later.</p>\n<p>Artz, Behrens and Lozouet went away in the winning move with over 40km to go ahead of the day&#8217;s final climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg.</p>\n<p>Scattered chase groups behind looked at one point to be dragging back the 30-second gap the leaders enjoyed over the final climb, but there wasn&#8217;t enough strength or coordination behind to fully eat into the lead on the closing local laps.</p>\n<p>14km from the line, as the riders passed through the finish line for the penultimate time, just 20 seconds separated the leaders from the chase of Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg) and Fabian Weiss (Switzerland).</p>\n<p>However, that was as close as those behind would get to the front of the race, leaving the three up front to decide the medal positions. Inside the final 5km, Lozouet was forced to let go of gold and silver as Behrens attacked to leave him behind.</p>\n<p>Artz stuck with the German, however, and had enough in the sprint to just edge out the 20-year-old in the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing. I didn&#8217;t expect to win,&#8221; Artz said after taking the win. &#8220;I was thinking all week &#8216;How can I possibly win?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a good group with three Dutch riders and then we went early with three of us but we were all strong riders. In the end, it would be a matter of who had the fastest legs and it was me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I said to my directeur sportif that I think it&#8217;ll be a sprint and I was waiting, waiting. In the end, the race broke open earlier than I thought. I&#8217;m happy that it turned out like this. It was perfect.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the time trialing over and done with at this year&#8217;s UEC Road European Championships, attention on Friday turned to the road races, with the U23 men tackling a 162km course between Heusden-Zolder and Hasselt after the U23 women had earlier opened the road racing action.</p>\n<p>The course featured six cobbled sectors including two major cobbled climbs. Two ascents of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg both came on two laps of a challenging Limburg circuit.</p>\n<p>Carl Kagevi (Sweden), Halvor Sandstad (Norway), Stian Rosenlund (Denmark), Julian Borresch (Germany), Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg), Roman Holzer (Switzerland) and Mateusz Gajdulewicz (Poland) formed the first breakaway of the day, but with the Belgian and Dutch teams controlling the pace, their lead never went much over half a minute.</p>\n<p>Once the race reached the Limburg circuit, another group got away with French trio Pierre Gautherat, Matys Grisel and Léandre Lozouet joined by Dutch trio of Huub Artz, Tibor del Grosso and Jesse Kramer, as well as Rasmus Søjberg Pedersen (Denmark, Alessandro Borgo (Italy), Niklas Behrens (Germany), Fabian Weiss (Switzerland), Matyas Kopecky (Czechia), and Alexandre Kess (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>The first climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg sparked a counterattack of nine riders as the race reached the cobbles of Manshoven where Lozouet, Artz and Behrens got away from the leaders.</p>\n<p>With more cobbles lying ahead on the Kriezel, their lead grew over the 13 chasers – Belgians Steffen De Schuyteneer and Sente Sentjens, plus Gautherat, Grisel, Del Groso, Kramer, Pedersen, Borgo, Christen, Weiss, Kopecky, Kess and Wenzel.</p>\n<p>On the Zammelenberg, the chase group lost Grisel, while the peloton behind was in tatters. With 35km to go, Wenzel and Weiss attacked to try to go across but struggled to close the gap, which held at just over 30 seconds at 20km to go.</p>\n<p>The second chase group featuring the Belgians was long gone and lay almost a minute further behind, with the peloton 2:30 from the leaders. Up front, the leading trio had plenty of work to do to hold off the chase behind, but with the closest groups splitting into ones and twos on the toughest sections of the course, they just had to keep working together.</p>\n<p>The leaders continued towards the finish holding a slim lead of never more than 30 seconds, but it proved to be enough to settle the race for the title as they fought amongst themselves during the closing circuit in Hasselt.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was Artz who prevailed in the sprint for the line, outpacing Behrens after the pair had distanced Lozouet a handful of kilometres away from the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"
