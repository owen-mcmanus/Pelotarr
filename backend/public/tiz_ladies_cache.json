The race was part of the UCI Women&#8217;s Road World Cup until 2015. In 2016, the race became part of the new UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour. In 2022, the race rebranded as Classic Lorient Agglom√©ration.</p>\n<p>Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) won the Classic Lorient Agglom√©ration for the third time in a row. In the sprint of a reduced peloton after an attritional finishing circuit, the 25-year-old held off Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Eline Jansen (VolkerWessels) to take the victory.</p>\n<p>From an early breakaway, Lucinda Brand (Lidl-Trek) and Sabrina Stultiens (VolkerWessels) survived onto the final lap, where they were caught by Femke De Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike), Eleonora Gasparrini (UAE Team ADQ), and Franzi Koch (Picnic PostNL).</p>\n<p>Brand and Stultiens could not follow these three on the C√¥te du L√©zot, where Liane Lippert (Movistar) attacked from the peloton, taking Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) with her and bridging to the front trio, with Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) just missing the move.</p>\n<p>However, things came back together after the last climb, the short Bosse de Kerscoulic, and after a few unsuccessful attacks, 21 riders entered the final kilometre together. Bredewold launched her sprint early and was passed by Vos for a time but fought back to win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúToday I was riding with my grandma in my head because we got some bad news this week, and I really wanted to get this win for her today,‚Äù an emotional Bredewold dedicated her victory to her grandmother.</p>\n<p>The Dutchwoman had crashed during the race, just before entering the finishing circuit, but came back to win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs lucky for me to crash here. Two years ago, I also crashed and won. I felt really good today, and the girls kept believing in me even though I crashed, and that gave me wings. I know how to do this finish really well, so I know how to time it. But Marianne came, she was in front of me for quite some time. I thought ‚ÄòI need to keep going‚Äô because I know I‚Äôm good in long sprints, and I could just pass her again, that was crazy,‚Äù Bredewold recounted the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 165.3km race started with a big loop through the hilly countryside around Plouay that was slightly changed from the 2024 edition before entering the finishing circuit with 31.5km to go. Crossing the finish line for the first time 23.6km from the end, the peloton faced 2.5 laps of the circuit, including two ascents of the gradual Rostervel climb and three ascents each of the steep C√¥te du L√©zot and the short Bosse de Kerscoulic.</p>\n<p>On the first 60km, several groups came together to form a large breakaway of 23 riders that included Blanka Vas, Steffi H√§berlin (both SD Worx-Protime), Nina Buijsman, Coralie Demay (both FDJ-Suez), Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ), Brand, Anastasiya Kolesava (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Eva van Agt, Margaux Vigi√© (both Visma-Lease a Bike), Evy Kuijpers (Fenix-Deceuninck), Alex Manly, Julia Borgstr√∂m (both AG Insurance-Soudal), Susanne Andersen (Uno-X Mobility), Silke Smulders, Jeanne Korevaar (both Liv AlUla Jayco), Henrietta Christie, Magdeleine Vallieres Mill (both EF Education-Oatly), Silvia Zanardi (Human Powered Health), C√©lia Le Mouel (Ceratizit), Franzi Koch, Nelson (both Picnic PostNL), Yuliia Biriukova (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), and Stultiens.</p>\n<p>Their advantage went up to three minutes, but the cooperation in this large group wasn‚Äôt ideal, and only Brand, Nelson, and Stultiens were left when the broadcast began with 62km to go, just over a minute ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Several riders crashed on the wet roads, and Bredewold herself was involved in a crash just before the race reached the finishing circuit and was making her way back to the peloton while Nelson could not keep up with Brand and Stultiens the first time up the C√¥te du L√©zot with 28.5km to go.</p>\n<p>Bredewold had come back to the peloton before passing the finish line with two laps or 23.6km to go. Brand and Stultiens were still 1:06 minutes ahead, but Nelson was caught early on the penultimate lap.</p>\n<p>UAE Team ADQ and Liv AlUla Jayco led the chase, but it was De Vries who attacked first on the C√¥te du L√©zot. Longo Borghini, Lippert, Koch, and Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health) went after her, but things came back together for a chasing group of 21 riders atop the Kerscoulic climb.</p>\n<p>After a brief attempt by Kerbaol, De Vries attacked again with 14.5km to go, quickly getting a gap. Koch and Gasparrini bridged to her, and a moment of hesitation in the chase group allowed them to pull away as a group of dropped riders return from behind.</p>\n<p>Entering the final lap, Brand and Stultiens were 15 seconds ahead of De Vries, Gasparrini, and Koch, with the peloton chasing at 40 seconds. Brand dropped Stultiens on the Rostervel climb but was herself caught by the chasers who had picked up Stultiens, forming a front group of five.</p>\n<p>With SD Worx-Protime chasing hard, the gap went down to only 13 seconds at the foot of the C√¥te du L√©zot where Koch attacked into the climb. Stultiens and Brand were quickly dropped, but De Vries and Gasparrini could follow the German champion, and in the peloton, Lippert made her move.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Vos were immediately on her wheel, but Vos had to let go, so only Lippert and Ferrand-Pr√©vot made it across to the front three while Longo Borghini was now trying to bridge on her own.</p>\n<p>Gasparrini launched an attack on the Bosse de Kerscoulic but could not get away, and at the top of the short climb, Georgi had passed Longo Borghini and brought a larger group to the front.</p>\n<p>Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) tried to get away inside the 3km mark but had no success. Koch then attacked from the front of the group but also got no gap. Lippert‚Äôs counterattack and Longo Borghini‚Äôs move just after the 2km mark were unsuccessful too, and De Vries then took over at the front, keeping a high pace onto the finishing straight where Bredewold launched early, lost the lead to Vos, but came back to win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=11248&amp;y=2022&amp;s=1&amp;lang=ENG&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=11248&amp;y=2022&amp;s=1&amp;lang=ENG&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The first edition was held in 2018 as a 1.2 category one-day race on the UCI women&#8217;s road cycling calendar and since 2019 it is held as a 2.2 category race over two days. Since 2022, it has been a one-day competition again.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) celebrated her seventh win of the 2025 season, taking out the UCI 1.1-ranked Kreiz Breizh Elite F√©minin with a late solo attack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was definitely a hard race to read,&#8221; Longo Borghini said. &#8220;I have to be honest, we lost a little bit our patience, and we tried to be a bit aggressive because the peloton was really going slow.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Brodie jumped across to the break and we tried to ride offensively with Gasparrini and Persico. We managed ot have Gaspa made it to Brodie&#8217;s break but Gaspa was a bit blocked. I got the orders to jump across &#8211; it was really hard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Margaux Vigi√© (Visma-Lease a Bike) chased the Italian champion to the line for second well ahead of a small peloton, led to the line by Uno-X Mobility&#8217;s Susanne Andersen.</p>\n<p>The 138.5-kilometre Kreiz Breizh Elite F√©minin attracted a strong field as riders were in the region for the weekend&#8217;s WorldTour round, the Classic Lorient Agglom√©ration.</p>\n<p>After a start under sunny skies, an early breakaway from Lucy Lee (DAS-Hutchinson) was reeled in and a second move went clear with Michaela Drummond (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Constance Valentin (Winspace Orange Seal) and Lauren Dickson (Handsling Alba).</p>\n<p>Drummond was dropped after the race reached the local laps and the trio were joined by Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ). With six laps to go, Valentin could no longer hold on, and Dickson and Chapman gained a new partner in Margaux Vigi√© (Visma-Lease a Bike). Chapman&#8217;s teammate Eleonora Gasparrini then bridged across and Dickson lost contact.</p>\n<p>With four of the six-kilometre laps to go, Vigi√© attacked to leave the two UAE Team ADQ riders behind.</p>\n<p>Chapman continued to chase at 45 seconds heading into three laps to go. She was joined by teammate Elisa Longo Borghini just before the line, which raised their odds of reeling in Vigi√©. The peloton was shattered in their wake, with two riders chasing in between Chapman and Longo Borghini and a small fraction of the bunch.</p>\n<p>Chapman couldn&#8217;t hold onto the Italian champion&#8217;s wheel for very long, leaving Longo Borghini to pursue the solo leader. The pair came together before two laps to go, when then had approximately 1:20 on the first peloton.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini left her French companion behind and claimed the win, while Vigi√© held on for second a distant 1:10 later.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9918&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9918&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) claimed the overall victory at the Tour de Romandie F√©minin in a nail-biting finish as Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) won the final undulating stage in Aigle in a three-up sprint.</p>\n<p>Chabbey finished third on the stage behind Vas and stage one winner Paula Blasi (UAE ADQ) to claim the first stage race victory of her career.</p>\n<p>Overnight leader Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal) was distanced on the final climb of the day, but chased valiantly in the final 10km to almost close the gap to the front three.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian came up short in the final kilometre and slipped to second on GC, with Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) finishing in third overall.</p>\n<p>At the climax of a hilly stage that started and finished near the UCI headquarters in Aigle, Chabbey unleashed a rapid burst of speed on the Antagnes climb 12 kilometres from the line, taking only Blasi with her as ≈Ωigart and Kastelijn struggled on the steepest pitches.</p>\n<p>Vas was able to get back on with an impressive descent and was always likely to be the fastest of the three if they made it to the line.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart may have made it back on, but for a mistake on the descent of Antagnes, giving the AG Insurance-Soudal rider too much to do in the closing stages.</p>\n<p>When the trio arrived at the final few hundred metres, Vas took her second win of the season after claiming the Hungarian national title for a sixth consecutive year in June.</p>\n<p>It was Chabbey, though, who had the widest smile of all as she claimed the biggest victory of her career just a stone‚Äôs throw from her childhood home in Geneva.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After yesterday, I was very happy,&#8221; Chabbey said after the stage, having won stage 2 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This morning, we said we have nothing to lose. We had a plan and we executed it well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted it to be hard on the climbs and for Juliette [Labous] to follow the attacks, and I could attack on the last climb. I wasn‚Äôt feeling that great, but then the team really pushed me. It‚Äôs a team win. It‚Äôs unbelievable.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the race finely poised heading into the final stage, multiple riders had the opportunity to clinch the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin yellow jersey on a lumpy day around the home of the UCI in Aigle.</p>\n<p>Just 13 seconds separated the top three on GC heading into the finale, with Chabbey and Kastelijn hoping to invent a plan to overhaul ≈Ωigart over the day‚Äôs 122 kilometres and five third-category climbs.</p>\n<p>The opening hour was played out over flat roads before the first of two ascents of Le Ch√¢tel (1.7km at 6.4%). A strong group of 13 riders moved away from the bunch, including the likes of 2022 champion Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), Claire Steels (Movistar) and Laura Stigger (SD Worx-Protime), who was the best-placed overall in 12th, 3:19 off the lead of ≈Ωigart.</p>\n<p>The leaders built an advantage of just over two minutes heading into the first climb, which was crested first by Morgane Coston (Roland Le D√©voluy) with the Queen of the Mountains jersey up for grabs. Steels rolled over the intermediate sprint in first place before the leaders approached La Rasse (2km at 8.8%), the second climb of the day. Steels attacked to score maximum points, putting herself within touching distance of the QOM jersey, held by ≈Ωigart. The Brit would go on to cross the line first on the second time up Le Ch√¢tel to draw level with ≈Ωigart.</p>\n<p>Behind, FDJ-SUEZ were applying pressure on Le Ch√¢tel, hoping to put Chabbey in the best position possible and to create problems for ≈Ωigart. They continued into the following 20km of flat road and brought the gap down to less than a minute with 30km and two more climbs to go, the bunch splitting as the wind howled into the valley.</p>\n<p>The leaders held a gap of 40 seconds heading into the stage‚Äôs penultimate climb, a second ascent of La Rasse. Before that, Steels had crossed another intermediate sprint in first to take over the lead of the points classification after her breakaway exploits in the previous stage. Steels‚Äô efforts paid off with the Brit going home with both the QOM and points jerseys. Stigger led onto the climb and drove the pace in an attempt to stay clear of the closing bunch. As Steels claimed the points over the top, the lead group had reduced to nine with a 30-second gap heading into the final 20km of the stage.</p>\n<p>With the gap closing, attacks began to fly from the 20-strong bunch behind. All was together heading into the final climb of Antagnes (1.2km @ 9%), which crested with 10km to go. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) was the first to attack, followed by Chabbey and several others. ≈Ωigart was initially slow to follow, but managed to close the gap to create a front group of six with the top three all there. Chabbey pushed on over the steepest section, taking stage one winner Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) with her, with ≈Ωigart and Kastelijn distanced by 15 seconds over the top with Blasi‚Äôs team-mate Magnaldi on the wheel.</p>\n<p>As Chabbey flew up front, ≈Ωigart made a mistake on the descent, going wide on a corner and losing the wheel of the now swollen chasing group. Chabbey was now in the driving seat with 4km to go, as Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) closed down the leading pair. ≈Ωigart re-joined the chase shortly after and had a gap of 20 seconds to cross if she wanted to take her first WorldTour stage race victory.</p>\n<p>As the road dragged towards the final kilometre, the gap halved with ≈Ωigart herself pulling on the front with her team-mate Mireia Benito contributing what she could. With 1km left, the gap was just 8 seconds, and Vas and Blasi began to lean on Chabbey. However, the Swiss had enough to keep the chase at bay as ≈Ωigart faded behind.</p>\n<p>In the final 200 metres, Vas launched an impressive sprint to snatch victory on the final stage, with Blasi two bike lengths behind in second. Chabbey‚Äôs efforts were enough for her to claim the yellow jersey two weeks after winning the QOM jersey at the Tour de France Femmes, with ≈Ωigart‚Äôs group also containing third-placed Kastelijn, 11 seconds behind at the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) took her first WorldTour victory on stage 2 of the Tour de Romandie F√©minin, unleashing a burst of speed in the final hundred metres of the summit finish to La Tzoumaz to beat Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal), who moved into the overall lead of the race.</p>\n<p>The pair were locked together for the entirety of the 12km ascent, with Chabbey only able to break the deadlock in the two-up sprint to win by three seconds. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) fought bravely to cross the line three further seconds behind ≈Ωigart in third.</p>\n<p>Overnight race leader Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) and race favourite Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) were distanced early on under the pressure of the tempo set by AG Insurance-Soudal on a tough day in the Swiss Alps.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart now holds an eight-second lead over Chabbey heading into the final stage, with Kastelijn 13 seconds back in third.</p>\n<p>Chabbey grew up in Geneva, a short distance away from the ski resort of La Tzoumaz. She was understandably delighted to pick up the biggest win of her career close to home despite some sickness after claiming the Queen of the Mountains jersey at the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs the most beautiful victory of my career,&#8221; said Chabbey after the finish. &#8220;With my family here, my sisters and brothers. The team was behind me. I can‚Äôt believe it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was sick after the Tour de France. I didn‚Äôt recover well. I came because it‚Äôs a home race.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chabbey also commented on the situation before the opening stage, when five teams were disqualified for refusing to comply with a UCI GPS safety tracking test.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs sad for the organisation, what happened yesterday. The organisation don‚Äôt have a lot of money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With an easier day on the cards on the final stage, Chabbey recognised that overhauling ≈Ωigart for the yellow jersey would be difficult, but she will try to attack the Slovenian on the stage starting and finishing in Aigle, home to the UCI.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nYoung Paula Blasi held a surprise 17-second overnight lead in the overall classification heading into the toughest stage of the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin after her prologue victory on the opening day. Her win in Villars-sur-Ollon was impressive, but with a 12.8km finishing climb to La Tzoumaz, the second stage was a different proposition altogether.</p>\n<p>The stage was mostly flat, apart from the double ascent of the third category Chamoson climb, breaking up the mid-part of the day. The riders knew the stage, and probably the entire race, was all about the final climb.</p>\n<p>As a result, there was little in the way of breakaway action early on. The first movement of the stage was the first of four intermediate sprints at Leytron after 34km ‚Äì which didn‚Äôt carry bonus seconds. Margot Vanpachtenbeke (VolkerWessels) won the opening dash, which bounced straight into the first ascent of Chamoson. Kastelijn, fourth in the prologue, sprang out of the pack to take maximum points, showing ambition for the climber‚Äôs jersey.</p>\n<p>Then came the first real attempt at a breakaway. It was Claire Steels (Movistar) who attacked the pack solo. She was soon followed by Giorgia Vettorello (Roland Le D√©voluy), but the Italian was stuck in no-man&#8217;s-land between the lead and the bunch. Steel and Vettorello would go on to take the first two places at the repeated intermediate sprint and Queen of the Mountains point. With 10km left before the bottom of La Tzoumaz, Steels had a lead of more than two minutes over the bunch, while Vettorello was dangling ahead of the peloton heading through the penultimate sprint in Aproz.</p>\n<p>As Steels continued through the final sprint in Riddes and onto La Tzoumaz, she held a lead of 90 seconds. Steels, an accomplished climber, got quickly into her rhythm on the steady 8% gradients. Behind, UAE Team ADQ took up the pace-making in support of race leader Blasi as the weaker climbers were shelled out the back. The group soon reduced to around 20 riders.</p>\n<p>Steels‚Äô lead melted away, and she was quickly swept up as Liv-AlUla Jayco lifted the pace through Caroline Andersson, looking to set up Mavi Garc√≠a. With 10km left, Andersson stopped her work, and responsibility went back into the hands of UAE Team-ADQ, who were in a strong position with five riders in the top-20 overall. AG Insurance-Soudal also contributed in support of ≈Ωigart as the race was being decided by riders going off the back. African champion Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), the winner of the first edition of this race, was dropped with 9km left alongside 8th-placed Alena Ivanchenko (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Under the pressure of AG Insurance-Soudal‚Äôs Mireia Benito, race favourite Juliette Labous was distanced with 8km left. The FDJ-SUEZ rider was in a group alongside Garc√≠a, but was attempting to fight back to the leading group.</p>\n<p>Leader Blasi was the next to go a kilometre later, as the advantage swung heavily in favour of AG Insurance-Soudal and ≈Ωigart, with Benito putting in a monster turn on the front. Just five riders remained in the leading group, with Kastelijn, Steffi H√§berlin (SD Worx-ProTime) and Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) alongside Benito and ≈Ωigart. With 6km left, Labous was well distanced, and Blasi was fading fast. The win would be fought out between this quintet, all five of whom were separated by 25 seconds in the overall standings heading into the stage.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart looked strong and attacked with 5.5km to go, immediately dropping Swiss champion H√§berlin and team-mate Benito, whose mammoth job for the day was complete. Kastelijn and Chabbey were able to follow the first acceleration, but the Dutchwoman was soon swinging off the back under the pressure of ≈Ωigart. She was dropped and dangled around 50 metres behind, but ≈Ωigart had more trouble with distancing Chabbey.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian continued to apply the tempo, with Chabbey lurking behind. The Swiss was sitting 15 seconds behind her companion heading into the stage, so she needed to attack if she wanted to take the yellow jersey. With 2km left, ≈Ωigart lifted her foot off the gas for the first time, forcing Chabbey through as Kastelijn tried to close the gap. ≈Ωigart came back to the front as they entered the final two kilometres, parts of which pitched above 9%.</p>\n<p>The pair were locked together moving into the final kilometre, with the gradient easing in the final few hundred metres. Chabbey kicked with 150 metres to go and immediately opened a gap on a tired-looking ≈Ωigart, with Kastelijn closing in behind.</p>\n<p>The local rider punched the air as she recorded her biggest ever victory on home roads. ≈Ωigart moves into a slim lead, with a punchy day starting and finishing in Aigle to conclude the race on stage 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) blasted to a breakthrough victory in the 4.4km hilly prologue of the Tour de Romandie F√©minin, although her success was almost completely overshadowed by a major dispute that erupted earlier that day between various top teams on the race and the UCI, leading to their expulsion.</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old completed the course in 11:17 to record her first WorldTour victory in her first professional season.</p>\n<p>Blasi held off the challenge of Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ), who finished second and third, 17 and 18 seconds down, respectively.</p>\n<p>The shape of the race had already shifted before the first rider rolled down the ramp in Hu√©moz, as five major teams were disqualified after they refused to take part in a UCI test of GPS safety tracking technology.</p>\n<p>Race favourites such as Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney of Canyon-SRAM-zondacrypto and Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Niamh Fisher-Black did not take to the start. The three other squads who are out of the race are EF Education-Oatly, Picnic-PostNL and Team Visma-Lease a Bike.</p>\n<p>The absence of the quintet of disqualified squads blew the race open. Blasi took full advantage to take the biggest win of her young career and move into the yellow jersey. The Spanish rider moved into road cycling late after a junior career as a runner and duathlete and surprised even herself with the result.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was not expecting to be up there,&#8221; Blasi said in the TV interview after the finish.<br />\n&#8220;I knew I was in good shape, I come from altitude [camp], but for sure my main goal is preparing for l‚ÄôAvenir, so I still have some days. Tour of Romandie was kind of let&#8217;s see how I start, and of course, I always go full gas, but I didn&#8217;t expect this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was really looking for the white jersey, the young one, because I thought it was the more accessible one and the one I could be more close to, but then when I arrived to the finish line and they said &#8211; &#8216;No, no, you actually have to have the best time.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was like, well, OK, let&#8217;s sit down and wait, but I didn&#8217;t believe it until the last one crossed the finish line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about the situation with the other teams dropping out of the race, Blasi had mixed emotions; grateful for a better opportunity to win, while also wanting to race against the best possible opposition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit sad, it&#8217;s a bit of a pity, because of course we always want the biggest competitors, so there is more to watch and more ambition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, it&#8217;s also good for us, because maybe the level will not be as high, so we can play a little bit more. But we always want the best in the race, so it&#8217;s a little bit sad that we don&#8217;t have these big teams in the race.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith five teams out of the race due to their refusal to take part in the UCI‚Äôs GPS tracking test, there was a significant element of the unknown heading into the first of three days of racing through the French-speaking region of Switzerland. Furthermore, hilly prologues are a regular feature in the men‚Äôs Tour de Romandie, but it was only in its fourth edition that the Tour de Romandie F√©minin peloton took on a short, sharp individual test in its opening stage for the first time. With much of the stage on gradients above 10%, this would certainly be a day for the climbers.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-ProTime‚Äôs Mikayla Harvey set the first time under the 12-minute mark early on in the day, but was soon pipped by less than two seconds by youngster Alena Ivanchencko (UAE Team ADQ). Both would go on to finish the stage in the top 10.</p>\n<p>The more recognised climbing talent started later on in the stage. Ivanchencko‚Äôs team-mate Erica Magnaldi edged ahead before being beaten by ≈Ωigart, who finished in 11:34 as the GC favourites began to threaten. The only former Romandie champion on the start-list, Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), who won the first edition in 2022, was off the pace of the best, finishing almost a minute behind Blasi.</p>\n<p>Blasi continued her excellent run in her first WorldTour season by eclipsing ≈Ωigart by 17 seconds, finishing in a time of 11:17 and leading as the likes of team-mate Silvia Persico, Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), and Mavi Garcia (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) attacked the 4.4km course. Persico may have come into the race as the team‚Äôs leader on paper, but she was well short of the mark set by her young teammate.</p>\n<p>Blasi is a winner of three UCI races this year and was fourth overall at the 2024 Tour de l‚ÄôAvenir Femmes, and she looked set to record a breakthrough result in Villars-sur-Ollon. Kastelijn was closer, but faded in the closing stages to finish 25 seconds shy, in third as it stood. Garc√≠a was over a minute down before Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) climbed into the top 10 on the stage.</p>\n<p>Just two riders remained to topple Blasi: Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-ProTime) and Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p>Labous was tipped as the main favourite after the drop-outs. She looked powerful as she took on the stage‚Äôs steepest sections in a solid, seated style, only occasionally getting out of the saddle to squeeze the power out of her legs.</p>\n<p>Bredewold was less suited to the tougher parts, but would look to take advantage of the flatter final third of the parcours. However, the climbing section had taken its toll on the Dutch champion. She crossed the line almost a minute down, just inside the top 20. It was a strong ride by Labous, but she wasn‚Äôt able to do enough to dethrone Blasi, who took the biggest victory of her young career, with Labous taking the final step on the podium.</p>\n<p>Blasi, clearly delighted by her triumph, fist-pumped the air in the leader‚Äôs hot seat and will go into the first road stage of the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin in the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

She was caught in the final 500 metres, and then Consonni started her sprint early on the cobbles, opening a gap on her stage and GC rivals.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a final stage winner&#8217;s ten-second time bonus, Consonni extended her lead to 15 seconds in the final GC.Stage 2 winner Linda Zanetti (Uno-X Mobility) was second on the stage and second overall at 13 seconds.</p>\n<p>Kathrin Schweinberger (Human Powered Health) was third overall at 21 seconds.</p>\n<p>The final stage covered 128.2km between Naleczow and Krasnik and was again a flat ride through the southern Polish countryside.</p>\n<p>There were a number of early attacks, but everything was kept under control as teams targeted the intermediate sprints.

Fortunately, she got up and finished the race.</p>\n<p>With 60km to go, Knijnenburg and Marie-Louise Hartz Krogager (Denmark) joined forces in an attack and Knijnenburg eventually pushed on alone.

I really gave it my all until the last metres, so I didn‚Äôt have time to savour it all, but I‚Äôm so happy to be able to win this stage and the general classification,‚Äù said Ferrand-Pr√©vot after her victory.</p>\n<p>The stage began with a scary moment for the yellow jersey and her team when she lost contact with the peloton on the opening descent, forcing Visma-Lease a Bike to chase hard to close the gap.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI made a mistake at the start of the race. Someone left a gap on the first descent, and suddenly I was dropped. My teammates did a massive effort to bring me back. I felt the pressure of wearing the yellow jersey a little, but it served as a good lesson for me. After that, I said, ‚ÄòOK, now I have to stay in front‚Äô,‚Äù Ferrand-Pr√©vot explained.</p>\n<p>Following a very select racing calendar and only training for two months ahead of the Tour paid off for the Frenchwoman, who was the dominant rider of the last two stages.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt may have looked easy, but it was the result of a lot of work. I think I have really set the bar this year on how to prepare for the Tour. I have made a lot of sacrifices. I thought about that yesterday, and I talked about it this morning with my teammates. This victory shows that it was worth it,‚Äù Ferrand-Pr√©vot finished.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 124.1km stage from Praz-sur-Arly to Ch√¢tel Les Portes du Soleil started with a descent, and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) was one of the first riders to attack, together with her teammate Femke Gerritse. They were joined by Lucinda Brand (Lidl-Trek) and another SD Worx-Protime rider, Lotte Kopecky, and the four riders were about 20 seconds ahead of the peloton after the descent.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Gigante had both lost contact in the descent, and their teams worked hard to bring them back while FDJ-Suez were pulling in the peloton to make that task as hard as possible.</p>\n<p>After 25km, the dropped riders were back, but the fast started had spelled the end for the early break. Undeterred, Van der Breggen attacked again and again on the first half of the first-category C√¥te d‚ÄôAr√¢ches-la-Frasse, finally getting away halfway up the 6km climb. At the top, Van der Breggen was a minute ahead of a group of only 15 riders that included most GC contenders.</p>\n<p>Several groups of dropped riders returned on the descent and in the valley, and Van der Breggen increased her lead to 2:05 minutes over a peloton of about 50 riders at the intermediate sprint in Morillon with 74.6km to go.</p>\n<p>FDJ-Suez and AG Insurance-Soudal reduced this to 1:46 minutes at the bottom of the Col de Joux Plane, but Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) slid out in the turn onto the climb, taking down her teammate C√©drine Kerbaol and Niewiadoma-Phinney as well. While the Pole was quickly back in the peloton, Kerbaol needed longer to get going again and soon was 40 seconds behind the other GC riders.</p>\n<p>Up front, Van der Breggen was slowly losing ground while AG Insurance-Soudal led out Gigante. Only nine riders were left in the group of GC contenders, and two immediately lost contact when Gigante made her move, leaving only Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek), and Dominika W≈Çodarczyk with the Australian climber.</p>\n<p>When Gigante took the pressure off the pedals, Lucinda Brand (Lidl-Trek) came back from behind and went on the attack right away but was closed down by Labous. The second half of the climb saw several changes in pace in the group of favourites as Gigante and W≈Çodarczyk tried without success to get away and Labous took the lead in between.</p>\n<p>One kilometre from the top, Vollering launched an attack that dropped Labous and W≈Çodarczyk, and another dig just before the mountain sprint put Gigante on a small gap to Vollering, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Fisher-Black, and Ferrand-Pr√©vot. Van der Breggen had a 45-second advantage over this group while Kerbaol had lost another two minutes on the climb, cresting the pass 2:45 minutes behind the other GC contenders. In the end, she would lose over nine minutes and drop from fifth to eighth place overall.</p>\n<p>W≈Çodarczyk, Labous, and Gigante came back to the four GC favourites on the plateau at the top, but when Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked on the descent, Gigante lost contact again. Chasing on her own, she would not see the others again until the finish.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the Col du Corbier with 34.8km to go, Van der Breggen was only 20 seconds ahead of her six chasers and would be caught 33.3km from the finish before quickly dropping back. At the top of the climb, Gigante was 2:14 minutes behind the front group and had dropped off the overall podium.</p>\n<p>The time gaps only increased further on the descent and the slightly-uphill valley road to Ch√¢tel where Labous did the lion‚Äôs share of the work, and Gigante would eventually fall to sixth place overall, being leapfrogged by Fisher-Black and W≈Çodarczyk.</p>\n<p>Vollering attacked the front group out of the third of the five hairpins of the steep Route de la B√©chigne through Ch√¢tel but could not get away. Instead, Ferrand-Pr√©vot made her move right after the fourth hairpin and over the top, increasing her gap to a few seconds before throwing herself into the 2km downhill.</p>\n<p>The yellow jersey started the 4km final climb 10 seconds ahead of Vollering, Niewiadoma-Phinney, and Fisher-Black and increased this to 20 seconds on the finish line. Vollering sprinted away on the finishing straight to take three seconds on Niewiadoma-Phinney and Fisher-Black, confirming her runner-up spot in the general classification.</p>\n<p>The green points jersey was won by Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime), winner of stages 3 and 4, while √âlise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) won the polka-dot mountain jersey after having worn it since stage 1. Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), 19th overall, won the white U23 jersey while FDJ-Suez took the team classification. Ma√´va Squiban (UAE Team ADQ), winner of stages 6 and 7, won the overall combativity award.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But I didn‚Äôt know how I compared to the others, so it was a bit of a step into the unknown, too. In an effort of an hour, an hour and 20 or 30 minutes, you have to manage yourself well, and I can do that. I can get myself to the edge of the red zone and stay there for a long time. That‚Äôs what I tried today, and it worked,‚Äù Ferrand-Pr√©vot explained.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe last kilometres were so painful.

After an attack by Koch, Claes, and Squiban had been brought back on the unclassified Col du Fr√™ne, the break was almost four minutes ahead while Morgane Coston (Roland Le D√©voluy) and C√©lia Le Mouel (Ceratizit) who had gone on the chase were reeled in by the peloton again.</p>\n<p>On the descent, yellow jersey Kim Le Court-Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) crashed when she overshot a corner, and her teammate, Gigante, also lost contact with the peloton. Green jersey Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) set a high pace on the rest of the descent, and FDJ-Suez, Visma-Lease a Bike, and EF Education-Oatly helped to keep the pressure on in the valley, but Gigante returned to the group when the road flattened.</p>\n<p>Le Court-Pienaar came back with 47km to go, and the pace in the peloton dropped, allowing the breakaway‚Äôs advantage to go out again. Atop the C√¥te de Saint-Georges-d‚ÄôHurti√®res, the gap was 3:47 minutes, and the peloton split again on the descent as Wiebes pushed on, with Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Le Court-Pienaar, and Gigante caught behind the split.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike mobilised their team to bring their GC leader back, and then Fenix-Deceuninck started chasing the breakaway, reducing the gap to the front to 1:30 minutes at the bottom of the 18.6km finishing climb.</p>\n<p>Markus set the pace in the break, dropping more and more riders, and when the Dutchwoman was done, Fisher-Black accelerated, and only Kastelijn, Vallieres, and Muzic could follow her. Another acceleration got rid of Vallieres and Muzic, leaving only Fisher-Black and Kastelijn at the front.</p>\n<p>Further back, Le Court-Pienaar had taken position at the front of the peloton to set the pace for Gigante, reducing the size of the group to less than a dozen riders and dropping a.o. Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), fifth in GC going into the stage.</p>\n<p>When the yellow jersey swung off, Gigante attacked right away, and only Rooijakkers could follow her acceleration. Niewiadoma-Phinney tried to follow but had to leave a gap, and Ferrand-Pr√©vot almost effortlessly pedalled past the Polish champion to bridge to Gigante and Rooijakkers, just before Ghekiere, having been in the breakaway, slotted in at the front of the group to pull them up the mountain.</p>\n<p>The Belgian champion cracked Rooijakkers who dropped back and was caught by Niewiadoma-Phinney, and when Ghekiere was done, Gigante continued at a hard pace. Ferrand-Pr√©vot briefly took over when Bunel came into sight up the road, and the young Frenchwoman reduced the gap to the front to 45 seconds with 9km to go.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot then quickly dropped Gigante and went on for an impressive solo victory after catching and dropping Fisher-Black and Kastelijn. Vollering recovered on the second half of the climb, being brought back to Niewiadoma-Phinney and Rooijakkers by Labous, and taking 23 seconds on the Polish allrounder on the final kilometre to move onto the third podium spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

And then on the last climb, I just gave it everything. In the last 15km, I could not hear anything on the radio, so I did not know how much of a gap I had. In the end, it worked out.‚Äù</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s incredible,&#8221; Squiban said on both French and English to broadcast cameras at the finish about a second win in as many days. &#8220;Yes, it was just an amazing day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first 100km of the 159.7km stage from Bourg-en-Bresse to Chamb√©ry were relatively flat before the C√¥te de Saint-France, C√¥te de Berland, and Col du Granier would test the peloton‚Äôs climbing abilities.</p>\n<p>A large breakaway formed about 25km into the stage when Squiban, Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Marie Le Net (FDJ-Suez), Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime), Mareille Meijering (Movistar), Lucinda Brand, Shirin van Anrooij (both Lidl-Trek), Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal), Megan Jastrab (Picnic-PostNL), Susanne Andersen (Uno-X Mobility), C√©lia Le Mouel (Ceratizit), Edwards, Alicia Gonz√°lez (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93), Fiona Mangan (Winspace Orange Seal), and the VolkerWessels duo of Eline Jansen and Maud Rijnbeek went away.</p>\n<p>In the peloton, Fenix-Deceuninck, Visma-Lease a Bike, and Liv AlUla Jayco led the chase, and Soraya Paladin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) had to abandon after a crash. At the intermediate sprint with 86.5km to go, the break was 3:33 minutes ahead. This increased to over five minutes after the C√¥te de Saint-Franc where Mangan and Brand were dropped while Jansen, Rijnbeek, Arzuffi, and Jastrab returned to the front after the descent.</p>\n<p>As Fenix-Deceuninck took up the chase for real, the gap was reduced to 3:40 minutes atop the C√¥te de Berland, and on the shallow climb after the mountain sprint, Rijnbeek went solo from the breakaway with 32km to go.</p>\n<p>Rijnbeek started the 8.9km Col du Granier about 30 seconds ahead of her former companions while the peloton was 2:13 minutes behind. As the chase group fell apart on the climb, Edwards and Meijering quickly bridged to Rijnbeek, then left her behind while Squiban rode away from Van Anrooij and Dygert and came back to the front.</p>\n<p>Van Anrooij and Dygert also returned to the front group halfway up the climb, but Squiban attacked soon after, and only Meijering could follow her. At the 20km mark, Squiban put in another acceleration that left Meijering behind, and she was 47 seconds ahead of the Dutchwoman at the top of the climb, 17.2km from the finish.</p>\n<p>In the peloton, Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck) set the pace for much of the climb, dropping a.o. Le Court-Pienaar and white jersey Julie Bego. Only Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Demi Vollering, Juliette Labous (both FDJ-Suez), Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) could stay with Rooijakkers, making Ferrand-Pr√©vot the virtual leader.</p>\n<p>Vollering came to the front on the last kilometres of the climb and led the group across the pass 1:30 minutes behind Squiban. Edwards and Van Anrooij were still in between, eventually passing Meijering on the descent. Le Court-Pienaar was 33 seconds behind the group of GC favourites at the top.</p>\n<p>Le Court-Pienaar and Kerbaol threw themselves into the descent to get back to the other GC contenders while Ghekiere, having been in the breakaway all day, waited for Gigante at the top to guide the minuscule Australian climber down the descent.</p>\n<p>Squiban was far ahead and could celebrate another stage victory while Kerbaol and Le Court-Pienaar returned to the group of favourites and Gigante managed to stay in touch. On the last four kilometres, Kerbaol went all-in, managed to bridge to Edwards and Van Anrooij, and outsprinted Edwards to take second place, gaining nine seconds plus six bonus seconds on the other GC contenders.</p>\n<p>Gigante and Rooijakkers lost 11 seconds in the final kilometres but are among the top favourites to win stage 8 to the Col de la Madeleine. Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), 20th overall, took the white jersey from Bego.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race has been extended to nine days, which will make it the longest Tour de France Femmes, and the longest event on the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Kim Le Court-Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) won stage 5 of the Tour de France Femmes, beating Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) in the sprint of a group of seven that formed on the Maupuy climb in Gu√©ret.</p>\n<p>Since Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) finished 33 seconds down in the second group, Le Court-Pienaar also takes back the yellow jersey as the new GC leader. Le Court-Pienaar now leads the overall classification by 18 seconds ahead of Vos&#8217; teammate Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 23 seconds ahead of Vollering as the race heads into stage 6 on Thursday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe came into the stage with a clear plan. First, to stay safe in the early part, because it was long and flat. There were a lot of crashes, my teammate got injured on the chin, but I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs back on the bike,&#8221; Le Court-Pienaar said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then the big goal was to take the bonus sprint, which I managed to do. And if we finish in a small group, to try to take the stage victory. It was a bit tricky at the end, it was closer than I expected, but luckily my kick was the fastest in the group,‚Äù she described the hectic stage finish among the selection of favourites.</p>\n<p>The new GC leader continued to thank her team, and in particular Sarah Gigante, who was one of the seven riders in the front group and contributed massively to the group staying ahead.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had a teammate with me, that helped a lot. I think if I didn‚Äôt have Sarah, maybe the group behind would have come back because some girls in the front group were not keen to pace. It was only Demi, Kasia, and me, who were keen to do the work and get to the line,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once Sarah got back after the downhill, I was really, really lucky to have her because she just committed fully to the line. Without her and the whole team, I couldn‚Äôt do what I did today, which shows that teamwork is really what you need in the sport.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Le Court-Pienaar had raised her arms in triumph before the finish line, and Vollering came from behind with speed, but the Mauritian champion was first over the line by half a wheel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre on the bike, maybe it can look close on TV, like at Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge. But when you turn around, you can see that you have the speed and will cross the line first. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching at home, but in a sprint, when you lift your hands, normally you should double-check, and it should be okay. Luckily, I had enough of a gap,‚Äù Le Court-Pienaar finished.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAt 165.8km, the stage from the Futuroscope theme park in Chasseneuil-du-Poitou to Gu√©ret was the longest of the nine-day race. Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) did not start the stage, leaving 143 riders in the peloton, though eight of them had to abandon in the crash-marred first two hours of the stage.</p>\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), Eugenia Bujak (Cofidis), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla Jayco), Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly), Katrine Aalerud, Maria Giulia Confalonieri (Uno-X Mobility), Marjolein van‚Äôt Geloof (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), and Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) all had to step off the bike. Green jersey Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) also went down but made it back to the peloton while Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a Bike), Maur√®ne Tr√©gou√´t (Arkey-B&#038;B Hotels), and Krist√Ωna Burlov√° (Ceratizit) were left chasing all day after their crashes.</p>\n<p>In a fast race with lots of attacks, it took over an hour for the breakaway to be established when Francesca Barale (Picnic PostNL) attacked solo. Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels) bridged across on her own, followed by Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly) and Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), and when Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) also came across halfway through the stage, a break of five was formed.</p>\n<p>They held an advantage of up to 4:35 minutes over a peloton, where Movistar did the lion‚Äôs share of work in the chase, reducing the gap to 1:47 minutes at the intermediate sprint with 39km to go.</p>\n<p>On the fourth-category C√¥te de Chabannes, Dijkstra and Soto were dropped from the break, and the peloton reduced the gap to under a minute ahead of the C√¥te du Peyroux, where Chapman attacked and dropped Jackson and Barale.</p>\n<p>Chapman crested the top of the climb, 22.6km from the finish, 17 seconds ahead of the peloton, and after a flurry of unsuccessful attacks, Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Ma√´va Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) got away and bridged to Chapman at the front. Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek) and Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) made the jump across soon after, forming a new front group of five.</p>\n<p>With 11km to go, this group had almost been reeled in when Squiban attacked again. However, she was caught on the lower slopes of the Maupuy climb. The bonus sprint with 8.6km to go was won by Le Court-Pienaar ahead of Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), and on the climb, a front group of seven riders emerged: Gigante, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Le Court-Pienaar, Vollering, Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), and Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>They crested the climb 23 seconds ahead of Vos and √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), with another group led by C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) another couple of seconds behind. Niewiadoma-Phinney put the pressure on in the descent, briefly splitting the group and dropping Gigante while Kerbaol‚Äôs group came back to Vos and Muzic.</p>\n<p>At the 3km mark, Gigante made it back to the front and immediately went to work to keep the chasers behind. Van der Breggen tried to anticipate a sprint with an attack on the final kilometre but was shut down by Le Court-Pienaar, who then started her sprint with 250 metres to go to win her first Tour stage and reclaim the GC lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Without her and the whole team, I couldn‚Äôt do what I did today, which shows that teamwork is really what you need in the sport.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Le Court-Pienaar had raised her arms in triumph before the finish line, and Vollering came from behind with speed, but the Mauritian champion was first over the line by half a wheel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre on the bike, maybe it can look close on TV, like at Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge. But when you turn around, you can see that you have the speed and will cross the line first. Maybe I gave a bit of a fright to people watching at home, but in a sprint, when you lift your hands, normally you should double-check, and it should be okay. Luckily, I had enough of a gap,‚Äù Le Court-Pienaar finished.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAt 165.8km, the stage from the Futuroscope theme park in Chasseneuil-du-Poitou to Gu√©ret was the longest of the nine-day race. Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) did not start the stage, leaving 143 riders in the peloton, though eight of them had to abandon in the crash-marred first two hours of the stage.</p>\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), Eugenia Bujak (Cofidis), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla Jayco), Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly), Katrine Aalerud, Maria Giulia Confalonieri (Uno-X Mobility), Marjolein van‚Äôt Geloof (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), and Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) all had to step off the bike. Green jersey Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) also went down but made it back to the peloton while Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a Bike), Maur√®ne Tr√©gou√´t (Arkey-B&#038;B Hotels), and Krist√Ωna Burlov√° (Ceratizit) were left chasing all day after their crashes.</p>\n<p>In a fast race with lots of attacks, it took over an hour for the breakaway to be established when Francesca Barale (Picnic PostNL) attacked solo. Anneke Dijkstra (VolkerWessels) bridged across on her own, followed by Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly) and Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), and when Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) also came across halfway through the stage, a break of five was formed.</p>\n<p>They held an advantage of up to 4:35 minutes over a peloton, where Movistar did the lion‚Äôs share of work in the chase, reducing the gap to 1:47 minutes at the intermediate sprint with 39km to go.</p>\n<p>On the fourth-category C√¥te de Chabannes, Dijkstra and Soto were dropped from the break, and the peloton reduced the gap to under a minute ahead of the C√¥te du Peyroux, where Chapman attacked and dropped Jackson and Barale.</p>\n<p>Chapman crested the top of the climb, 22.6km from the finish, 17 seconds ahead of the peloton, and after a flurry of unsuccessful attacks, Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Ma√´va Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) got away and bridged to Chapman at the front. Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek) and Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) made the jump across soon after, forming a new front group of five.</p>\n<p>With 11km to go, this group had almost been reeled in when Squiban attacked again. However, she was caught on the lower slopes of the Maupuy climb. The bonus sprint with 8.6km to go was won by Le Court-Pienaar ahead of Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), and on the climb, a front group of seven riders emerged: Gigante, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Le Court-Pienaar, Vollering, Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), and Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>They crested the climb 23 seconds ahead of Vos and √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez), with another group led by C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) another couple of seconds behind. Niewiadoma-Phinney put the pressure on in the descent, briefly splitting the group and dropping Gigante while Kerbaol‚Äôs group came back to Vos and Muzic.</p>\n<p>At the 3km mark, Gigante made it back to the front and immediately went to work to keep the chasers behind. Van der Breggen tried to anticipate a sprint with an attack on the final kilometre but was shut down by Le Court-Pienaar, who then started her sprint with 250 metres to go to win her first Tour stage and reclaim the GC lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

There will be no time loss, as the crash occurred in the last 5km, but it remains to be seen which injuries Vollering and the other riders who crashed have sustained.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even realise the crash was happening, to be honest. I was focusing so much on getting well through the corners. These corners were also a bit tricky and sketchy, so I really was focused on following the wheel of Lotte [Kopecky], and I hope all the riders are OK. I heard Demi was also in the crash. I hope she‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Wiebes said after her victory.</p>\n<p>Even in a reduced group after the crash, it was still a chaotic sprint, but Wiebes had her teammate Kopecky to pilot her onto the finishing straight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can trust Lotte fully, and that makes it really good because I can focus on her wheel and I know that she will deliver me in a good way. To be honest, I could not wait to start my sprint after waiting for 160km, and I was so excited that I started maybe a bit too early,‚Äù Wiebes described the final.</p>\n<p>Unlike other sprint finishes where Wiebes was far ahead of the rest, Vos gave her a close fight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI saw already in the Giro that she could stay in my wheel, so I knew to keep an eye on her. I learned from Amstel [the 2024 Amstel Gold Race where Vos beat Wiebes on the line] that I need to look to the left and to the right side to see her. It was to the finish, and I realised it was enough,‚Äù Wiebes said.</p>\n<p>With one stage victory under her belt, the European champion is now looking ahead to stage 4.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe go for it again tomorrow. The team did so well today, controlling the breakaway the whole stage. I hope the girls recover a bit for tomorrow because it‚Äôs a hard day again for them and for us,‚Äù finished Wiebes.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nCovering 163.5km from La Gacilly to Angers, the flat stage included only one categorised climb and was expected to finish in a sprint, with tailwinds contributing to a fast pace. Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) did not start the stage due to a gastrointestinal infection.</p>\n<p>The break of the day was established within the first 15km when Canadian champion Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), Cl√©mence Latimier (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), Spanish champion Sara Mart√≠n (Movistar), and Chilean champion Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) went away.</p>\n<p>Their advantage maxed out at 4:45 minutes before SD Worx-Protime took up the chase. At the intermediate sprint in Vern-d‚ÄôAnjou with just under 40km to go, the peloton‚Äôs deficit had been reduced to 2:38 minutes, and with Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) lending a hand to the SD Worx-Protime riders, the gap was down to 49 seconds at the 20km mark.</p>\n<p>With 11km to go and the peloton only 30 seconds away, the escapees started to attack each other. Latimier was the first to jump but paid for it immediately when she couldn‚Äôt follow the counterattacks.</p>\n<p>After attempts by Mart√≠n and Jackson, Soto jumped clear 8km from the line, but Jackson and Mart√≠n came back to her with 6.5km to go. They were all caught with 6km to go though, setting up a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Turning right off the Pont Jean Moulin 3.7km from the finish, a touch of wheels around position 20 caused a mass crash that took down a.o. Vollering, Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Dygert, Letizia Paternoster (Liv AlUla Jayco) and held up Le Court and the vast majority of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Marie Le Net (FDJ-Suez) brought the group of about 20 riders that escaped from the crash onto the finishing straight, and Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) went long with 450 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Behind the Swisswoman, Kopecky led out Wiebes who launched her sprint at the 200-metre sign. Vos was on Wiebes‚Äô wheel and managed to hold on to it, even coming out of the slipstream for a moment before realising that Wiebes was too strong and settling for second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race has been extended to nine days, which will make it the longest Tour de France Femmes, and the longest event on the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won stage 3 of the Tour de France Femmes, beating Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) in the sprint of a small group that escaped a crash in the last 5km.</p>\n<p>With the bonus seconds for second place, Vos takes back the yellow jersey from Kim Le Court-Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal), who was caught out behind the late-race crash and the splits in the field into Angers and so did not contest the final sprint.</p>\n<p>Vos now leads the GC by six seconds ahead of Le Court and 12 seconds ahead of her teammate Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot.</p>\n<p>The break of the day had been caught 6km from the line, but with 3.7km to go, there was a mass crash in a right-hand turn off a bridge.</p>\n<p>GC favourite Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) was among the crashed riders and visibly in pain as she was helped up by her teammates to roll across the line. There will be no time loss, as the crash occurred in the last 5km, but it remains to be seen which injuries Vollering and the other riders who crashed have sustained.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even realise the crash was happening, to be honest. I was focusing so much on getting well through the corners. These corners were also a bit tricky and sketchy, so I really was focused on following the wheel of Lotte [Kopecky], and I hope all the riders are OK. I heard Demi was also in the crash. I hope she‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Wiebes said after her victory.</p>\n<p>Even in a reduced group after the crash, it was still a chaotic sprint, but Wiebes had her teammate Kopecky to pilot her onto the finishing straight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI can trust Lotte fully, and that makes it really good because I can focus on her wheel and I know that she will deliver me in a good way. To be honest, I could not wait to start my sprint after waiting for 160km, and I was so excited that I started maybe a bit too early,‚Äù Wiebes described the final.</p>\n<p>Unlike other sprint finishes where Wiebes was far ahead of the rest, Vos gave her a close fight.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI saw already in the Giro that she could stay in my wheel, so I knew to keep an eye on her. I learned from Amstel [the 2024 Amstel Gold Race where Vos beat Wiebes on the line] that I need to look to the left and to the right side to see her. It was to the finish, and I realised it was enough,‚Äù Wiebes said.</p>\n<p>With one stage victory under her belt, the European champion is now looking ahead to stage 4.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe go for it again tomorrow. The team did so well today, controlling the breakaway the whole stage. I hope the girls recover a bit for tomorrow because it‚Äôs a hard day again for them and for us,‚Äù finished Wiebes.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nCovering 163.5km from La Gacilly to Angers, the flat stage included only one categorised climb and was expected to finish in a sprint, with tailwinds contributing to a fast pace. Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) did not start the stage due to a gastrointestinal infection.</p>\n<p>The break of the day was established within the first 15km when Canadian champion Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), Cl√©mence Latimier (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), Spanish champion Sara Mart√≠n (Movistar), and Chilean champion Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) went away.</p>\n<p>Their advantage maxed out at 4:45 minutes before SD Worx-Protime took up the chase. At the intermediate sprint in Vern-d‚ÄôAnjou with just under 40km to go, the peloton‚Äôs deficit had been reduced to 2:38 minutes, and with Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) lending a hand to the SD Worx-Protime riders, the gap was down to 49 seconds at the 20km mark.</p>\n<p>With 11km to go and the peloton only 30 seconds away, the escapees started to attack each other. Latimier was the first to jump but paid for it immediately when she couldn‚Äôt follow the counterattacks.</p>\n<p>After attempts by Mart√≠n and Jackson, Soto jumped clear 8km from the line, but Jackson and Mart√≠n came back to her with 6.5km to go. They were all caught with 6km to go though, setting up a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Turning right off the Pont Jean Moulin 3.7km from the finish, a touch of wheels around position 20 caused a mass crash that took down a.o. Vollering, Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Dygert, Letizia Paternoster (Liv AlUla Jayco) and held up Le Court and the vast majority of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Marie Le Net (FDJ-Suez) brought the group of about 20 riders that escaped from the crash onto the finishing straight, and Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) went long with 450 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Behind the Swisswoman, Kopecky led out Wiebes who launched her sprint at the 200-metre sign. Vos was on Wiebes‚Äô wheel and managed to hold on to it, even coming out of the slipstream for a moment before realising that Wiebes was too strong and settling for second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race has been extended to nine days, which will make it the longest Tour de France Femmes, and the longest event on the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) won stage 2 of the Tour de France Femmes, holding off the peloton on the uphill finish in Quimper. The 41-year-old Spaniard attacked 10.8km from the line and went all-in to build a 20-second advantage.</p>\n<p>At the flamme rouge, Garc√≠a was still 12 seconds ahead, and although she struggled on the climb and Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) made a move from the peloton, nobody pushed on behind, allowing Garc√≠a to hold on and take the victory.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won the sprint of a reduced peloton by several bike lengths while Kim Le Court-Pienaar (AG Insurance-Soudal) beat Liane Lippert (Movistar) to third place in a photo finish.</p>\n<p>The four bonus seconds from that third place put Le Court-Pienaar in the yellow jersey, with stage 1 winner Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) finishing in fifth on the same time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôve had a very complicated year. I was thinking about how many years I‚Äôve been doing this already and if it was time to think about retiring,&#8221; said Garc√≠a after the finish. &#8220;The truth is that I was already thinking about it because this year wasn‚Äôt going very well for me, but this gives me a lot of energy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have attacked so many times, I always try, and it never worked out for me. I didn‚Äôt believe I could win until I was five metres from the finish line, turned around, and saw they weren‚Äôt coming when I thought they would pass me. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had such a wonderful feeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the opening stage in the Morbihan d√©partement, stage 2 travelled through Finist√®re from Brest to Quimper. The 110.4km course included four classified climbs and many more uncategorised hills, making it a continuous up-and-down with hardly any flat stretches.</p>\n<p>Still suffering from a crash in the Baloise Ladies Tour, Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL) did not start the stage, leaving 152 riders in the race after Marlen Reusser (Movistar) had to abandon on stage 1.</p>\n<p>Coincidentally, their teammates Aude Biannic (Movistar) and Franzi Koch (Picnic PostNL) formed the early breakaway, having attacked in the first 10km. Their advantage never exceeded 1:20 minutes, though, and they were caught on the third-category climb of Menez Quelerc‚Äôh when Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) and polka-dot jersey √âlise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) attacked from the peloton in a bid for the mountain points.</p>\n<p>Smulders was first over the top to take three points, leaving two for Chabbey, and they both decided to keep going after the climb. After an unsuccessful attempt by Christina Schweinberger (Fenix-Deceuninck), Maud Rijnbeek (VolkerWessels) bridged to the front duo with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>On the C√¥te de Locronan, Chabbey and Smulders left Rijnbeek behind again as they went for the mountain points, with Chabbey first at the top. In the peloton, local rider C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) and stage 1 runner-up Le Court-Pienaar set the pace on the climb, 47 seconds behind the front.</p>\n<p>As the race was closing in on the finishing circuit around Quimper, local rider Ma√´va Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) attacked from the peloton and picked up Rijnbeek, who rode with her for a short while but soon dropped back while Squiban bridged to the front before the first ascent of the C√¥te du Chemin de Troh√©ir.</p>\n<p>Chabbey won the mountain sprint, and when the front trio crossed the finish line with one lap of 25.9km to go, they were 42 seconds ahead of the peloton. Chabbey, Squiban, and Smulders took the bonus seconds atop the Pen ar Stang climb in Quimper, but Niewiadoma-Phinney and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>When the two GC contenders were brought back just after the 20km mark, the front group was only 15 seconds ahead, and Riejanne Markus (Lidl-Trek) bridged across on her own. But 12km from the finish, the four escapees were reeled in by the peloton that only counted about 60 riders by this point.</p>\n<p>Garc√≠a then floated off the front and used the descent into the C√¥te du Chemin de Troh√©ir to build a 20-second advantage. Behind, Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) attacked into the climb, then Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) took over. Chabbey set up Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), who briefly tested her legs but could not force a selection, and after another pull by Ottestad, Chabbey took the last remaining mountain point 11 seconds behind Garc√≠a.</p>\n<p>Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek) launched an attack that was quickly shut down by Chabbey, then Koch and Magdeleine Vallieres (EF Education-Oatly) came to the front but didn‚Äôt chase wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>From 2km out, Labous increased the pace. Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) returned to the group after having been dropped on the climb and came to the front to chase, leading the peloton onto the final kilometre with teammate Anna van der Breggen on her wheel, 14 seconds behind Garc√≠a.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen took over briefly, then Niewiadoma-Phinney made her move and strung out the group. Having reduced the gap to Garc√≠a to only three seconds after the steep first half of the climb, Niewiadoma-Phinney and Le Court-Pienaar then looked around to see who else would contribute to closing the gap. Soraya Paladin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) came to the front in support of the Polish champion but also stopped with 350 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Standing up in her pedals and looking around time and again, Garc√≠a went up the almost-flat finishing straight while Ferrand-Pr√©vot wound up the sprint behind. Wiebes came around with her trademark acceleration at the 150-metre mark, but it was too late: Garc√≠a was on the last 50 metres and could raise her arms in triumph on the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15687&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is taking place from 26 July to 3 August 2025 and is the 22nd race in the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. The race has been extended to nine days, which will make it the longest Tour de France Femmes, and the longest event on the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) powered to victory on stage 1 of the Tour de France Femmes, outpacing Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) to the line at the end of the uphill drag in Plumelec and took the first yellow leader‚Äôs jersey of the nine-day race.</p>\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), who attacked inside of 700 metres to go on the C√¥te de Cadoudal, was reeled in at the line and held on to third place.</p>\n<p>Vos received a perfect leadout from her Visma teammates, who took control of a dwindling peloton with five kilometres to go with Ferrand-Pr√©vot as her final leadout woman.</p>\n<p>Though she reacted immediately, Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) could not close the gap to the French rider, and Le Court took up the chase with Vos on her wheel.</p>\n<p>Vos came around in the final metres to take the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, the whole race, of course, it was short, so we knew it was going to be nervous. Sometimes, just spread out. But still, you feel the tension in the bunch. And, we wanted to do a lead-out as a team before the final descent, before the corner, to put Pauline and me in a good position. And the girls did such an amazing job. And then Pauline took a gap at 500, 400 metres to go, and she actually had a really good gap,&#8221; Vos said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, that moment, of course, I looked around and who was coming, and then I saw Kim Le Court coming. She really had a good sprint, so I went with her. And, I didn&#8217;t know if Pauline was still hanging in for the finish, but in the end, I saw her dropping the speed, so I sprinted with Kim, and we just caught Pauline, which is, of course, a bit of a devil feeling. But I&#8217;m so happy with the team effort, and we could make it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For the winningest rider of all time, and the 2024 overall points winner, taking the yellow jersey on the first day was &#8220;really special.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Tour de France, it&#8217;s the first day, you really can&#8217;t describe what it means.

The race is taking place from 26 July to 3 August 2025 and is the 22nd race in the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. The race has been extended to nine days, which will make it the longest Tour de France Femmes, and the longest event on the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) powered to victory on stage 1 of the Tour de France Femmes, outpacing Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) to the line at the end of the uphill drag in Plumelec and took the first yellow leader‚Äôs jersey of the nine-day race.</p>\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), who attacked inside of 700 metres to go on the C√¥te de Cadoudal, was reeled in at the line and held on to third place.</p>\n<p>Vos received a perfect leadout from her Visma teammates, who took control of a dwindling peloton with five kilometres to go with Ferrand-Pr√©vot as her final leadout woman.</p>\n<p>Though she reacted immediately, Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) could not close the gap to the French rider, and Le Court took up the chase with Vos on her wheel.</p>\n<p>Vos came around in the final metres to take the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Actually, the whole race, of course, it was short, so we knew it was going to be nervous. Sometimes, just spread out. But still, you feel the tension in the bunch. And, we wanted to do a lead-out as a team before the final descent, before the corner, to put Pauline and me in a good position. And the girls did such an amazing job. And then Pauline took a gap at 500, 400 metres to go, and she actually had a really good gap,&#8221; Vos said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, that moment, of course, I looked around and who was coming, and then I saw Kim Le Court coming. She really had a good sprint, so I went with her. And, I didn&#8217;t know if Pauline was still hanging in for the finish, but in the end, I saw her dropping the speed, so I sprinted with Kim, and we just caught Pauline, which is, of course, a bit of a devil feeling. But I&#8217;m so happy with the team effort, and we could make it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For the winningest rider of all time, and the 2024 overall points winner, taking the yellow jersey on the first day was &#8220;really special.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Tour de France, it&#8217;s the first day, you really can&#8217;t describe what it means.

However, Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike as Nienke Veenhoven (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) laid down a powerful lead-out for Fidanza.</p>\n<p>Fidanza beat Barbara Guarischi (Team SD Worx &#8211; Protime) to second place, while Chiara Consonni (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) finished third.</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt was not active in the final sprint; however, Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto had carefully orchestrated the day&#8217;s racing. An early breakaway contained 21st placed Mackenzie Coupland (Liv AlUla Jayco Women&#8217;s Continental Team), who at a 56-second deficit in the general standings moved into the virtual leader&#8217;s jersey for much of the day.</p>\n<p>However, Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto, aided by Team Picnic-PostNL, controlled the gap and navigated B√§ckstedt safely into the lead group.</p>\n<p>Scarlett Souren (VolkerWessels Cycling Team) made a bold attack within the final 7km, but it was brought home with 2km remaining, setting the race up for the final sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Super hectic, I think more hectic than I imagined,&#8221; B√§ckstedt said, describing the race after the finish. &#8220;I think the rain brought a lot of that tension in the peloton, but once you stopped around halfway, then it got flowing a little bit better. And then it was a little bit more enjoyable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt was aware of the threat of a breakaway to her overall race lead. &#8220;Yeah, for sure, there was some danger with the breakaway, but it was controlled nicely and came back to a sprint.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we had two generation riders, so we weren&#8217;t as strong as other teams with full WorldTour trains,&#8221; B√§ckstedt said of their reluctance to control the final sprint. &#8220;In the end, we had to gamble a little, and thankfully, it paid off. Otherwise, I think we would have started to help out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She was also close to the final straight crash, &#8216;Yeah, I was next to it, and in the sprint, when you&#8217;re going so fast, you don&#8217;t really see what happened,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I really just hope everyone is alright. It sounded, and from my side vision, it looked awful. So yeah, I wish everyone the best.&#8221;</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt described her double stage win yesterday as her key achievement at the race, but continued, &#8220;I think the whole week has been good. I&#8217;ve enjoyed racing. It&#8217;s been some good also some good learning steps for me, and, yeah, helping, helping the others in the team as well. So yeah, it&#8217;s just been a fun week. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to her developing form as a rider, she said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what the future brings. I think maybe you&#8217;re not going to see me winning at the top of Alpe d&#8217;Huez, but yeah, it&#8217;s maybe some flatter races I couldn&#8217;t do well at.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She was, however, clear that she would be riding cyclocross in the winter. &#8220;Oh, 100% I will be there,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

She dropped the Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike rider and was joined by Marie Schreiber (Team SD Worx‚ÄìProtime) for a final 2km two-up time trial in the shadow of a charging peloton.</p>\n<p>The momentum briefly sapped out of the chase with just over 1km remaining, which gave Schreiber and B√§ckstedt a brief window to extend their gap before charging onto a shallow ascent to the final sprint.</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt took the stage by a handful of metres, while Schreiber narrowly held off the charging sprint trains to take second from teammate Barbara Guarischi (Team SD Worx‚ÄìProtime).</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a different day compared to the last road stages,&#8221; B√§ckstedt said following the race finish. &#8220;Super short, which I think suits me quite well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In that last lap, there were a lot of attacks, and with only two of us in the front group, I had to follow everything. I saw a rider from Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike go up the road with about 2.5 kilometres to go, and I thought, &#8216;This is the only chance,'&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A small thank you to Marie for helping me keep the gap out a little bit. I&#8217;m really happy,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Asked if she thought she could make it a third victory at the race with an ITT victory this evening, B√§ckstedt said. &#8220;I would like to try. I&#8217;d like to do my very best. The way my legs are feeling, I think it&#8217;s possible. But we have to see what the rest of the day brings first.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard,&#8221; she added, &#8220;especially with this heat. I think it&#8217;s going to make a lot of people really tired by the end of the day, and especially then for tomorrow as well. But it&#8217;s part of a stage race, so we have to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The day was predictably animated given its short 93km profile, with multiple attacks from the start and a resilient breakaway containing Marion Norbert Riberolle (VolkerWessels Cycling Team), Sterre Vervloet (Lotto Ladies), Marieke Meert (VolkerWessels Cycling Team) and Clara Lundmark (Team Hess Cycling Team).</p>\n<p>They were pulled in with 14km remaining, and Femke Markus (Team SD Worx‚ÄìProtime) made several audacious attacks following the catch, but only B√§ckstedt&#8217;s final effort managed to make an attack stick.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I really struggled to keep her wheel,&#8221; Veenhoven said about the final sprint in a team statement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the final stretch I was able to do my own sprint and then I was able to lift my hands to celebrate for the first time as a professional. I&#8217;m very happy with my first pro win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Race leader Charlotte Kool (Picnic-PostNL) retained the top overall position with a seventh-place finish on the third day of racing. With bonus seconds as stage winner, Veenhoven jumped six spots to second overall, now 5 seconds behind Kool. Prologue winner Zoe B√§ckstedt (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) remained eight seconds back, but now in third overall, while and Ellen Van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) was 10 seconds back in fourth.</p>\n<p>At 127.3km in distance, stage 2 is the longest of the five days of racing, just 100 metres longer than stage 1. Scattered on the route were only a few rises, just two small categorised climbs. There were also six sectors of cobblestones, for just under 6km, in the opening half of the race, the longest stretch of cobbles at 1.9km ridden twice at Huisepontweg.</p>\n<p>Just seven kilometres into the stage, five riders got away &#8211; Matilde Vitillo (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Aidi Gerde Tuisk (Team Coop-Repsol), L√©a Stern (KDM-Pack Cycling), Rose Kloese (WV Schijndel) and Natalie Quinn (USA National Team).</p>\n<p>The quintet built a lead of 2:25 as they passed over the second and final climb, the Nokereberg (300 metres at 5.5%) with 69km to go. Once through the Nokeredorpstraat and Herlegemstraat sectors of cobbles, the second half of the race was underway, and the cobbles were in the rear view mirror, with the finishing circuit approaching.</p>\n<p>With the final 60km to go, third-placed Van Dijk went down. She was back in the peloton, and the chase went into full gear on the first of five finish circuits with 42km to go, the margin to the breakaway reduced to under 50 seconds.</p>\n<p>Over the next flat 10km, the gap had completely collapsed and the peloton was all together. The pack passed through the second and final intermediate sprint, no bonus seconds on offer, however, and the next flurry of attacks followed, sparked by B√§ckstedt. A large group of 11 riders gained a small gap over the peloton, Femke Markus (SD Worx-Protime) pushing the pace, but the efforts subsided after 5km.</p>\n<p>The next riders to attack were Henrietta Colborne (Velopro-Alphamotorhomes) and Febe Jooris (UAE Development Team), who had two bottles packed into her jersey back pocket, 22km and two circuits to go. Once Jooris secured her bottles, she and the British rider opened a 20-second gap across the next 4km, climbing a large bridge to signal one-and-a-half circuits remaining.</p>\n<p>Once the bell lap was underway, the lead duo made glances behind them and could see the peloton making inroads with a steady pace.</p>\n<p>With 10km to go, Colbourne rolled back into the peloton, leaving Jooris, the 2024 U23 women&#8217;s time trial champion of Belgium, alone out front. Jooris&#8217; day ended soon after, and SD Worx-Protime&#8217;s Marcus threw an attack.</p>\n<p>Marcus still had a small gap as she powered along the main road into Olsene with 5.5km to go, the peloton being driven by Canyon-Sram Zondacrypto, Visma-Lease a Bike and Picnic-PostNL, Marike Meert (VolkerWessels) able to bridge to Marcus.</p>\n<p>The peloton overtook the lead duo with 3.2km to go and the sprinters jockeyed for position for the sprint finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9904&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

After taking the race lead off Reusser on the penultimate stage, Longo Borghini defended the pink jersey on stage 8 from Forl√¨ to Imola, finishing fourth behind the Swiss woman on the day.</p>\n<p>Liane Lippert (Movistar) beat Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) in a two-up sprint for the stage victory after the two had escaped from a group of 12 riders in the last 3km.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit unreal to win two stages here.

In the end, I was with Anna, and it was a perfect situation for me,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started the Giro thinking ‚ÄòI will not be good here, I will not be good in the Tour‚Äô, now I‚Äôm going home with so much confidence. Our sport is like a rollercoaster, and everyone has to keep that in mind and always look for better times. They will come.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage covered 134km, ending with 3.5 laps of the 2020 World Championships circuit that finished in the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near Imola. With a climb to Monticino as well as four ascents of the Cima Gallisterna and three climbs to Mazzolano, it was a very hilly route.</p>\n<p>Gigante won the first mountain sprint in Monticino, putting her back in the lead of the mountain classification, and the Australian would go on to win the blue mountain jersey. Then it was red jersey Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) who went on a solo breakaway, winning the intermediate sprint to confirm her victory in the points classification.</p>\n<p>Wiebes was joined by Sara Casasola (Fenix-Deceuninck) and L√©a Curinier (FDJ-Suez) the first time up the Cima Gallisterna, and when they crossed the finish line, they were 1:20 minutes ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>One lap later, the gap had fallen to just over one minute, and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek) and Mikayla Harvey (SD Worx-Protime) had bridged to the front group. Wiebes started to struggle on the climbs and was eventually dropped on the penultimate ascent of the Cima Gallisterna.</p>\n<p>At the top, 37.8km from the finish, the four escapees were 17 seconds ahead of a peloton that had been reduced to 32 riders. From that group, Lore De Schepper (AG Insurance-Soudal) launched an attack on the ridge at the top that was followed by Isabella Holmgren (Lidl-Trek) but neutralised by white jersey Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-Sram Zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>The breakaway gained time again on the way to the Autodromo and started the final lap with a 42-second advantage. An attack by Curinier led to Casasola losing contact, and on the Mazzolano climb, Spratt was dropped as well while Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Smulders reached Curinier and Harvey and led the trio over the top with a 30-second lead over the peloton, where Lieke Nooijen (Visma-Lease a Bike) had attacked just before the mountain sprint.</p>\n<p>On the steepest part of the Cima Gallisterna, Smulders accelerated and left Harvey and Curinier behind. De Schepper was now pacing in the peloton that had caught Nooijen, and the young Belgian&#8217;s pace reduced the group to less than 20 riders.</p>\n<p>When De Schepper swung off, Gigante accelerated even more, blowing the group apart as only Niedermaier, Lippert, Reusser, Holmgren, Longo Borghini, and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health) could follow her move.</p>\n<p>Smulders crested the climb only four seconds ahead of the chase group that was now led by Rooijakkers, who, like Van der Breggen, had come back on the last part of the climb. Rooijakkers&#8217; attack on the ridge was shut down by Holmgren. √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez) and Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) also returned to the group.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Reusser took up the chase behind Smulders, with Holmgren also taking a turn, and the lone attacker was reeled in 5.8km from the finish. Holmgren attacked just before the 5km mark but immediately had Reusser in her wheel.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen was next to try, putting the pressure on in the descent and causing Malcotti, Magnaldi, Holmgren, Rooijakkers, and Gigante to lose contact, though all five riders came back around the 3km mark. Van der Breggen took a breather, letting Reusser lead the group for a while before launching another move that was followed by Lippert.</p>\n<p>Reusser looked across and let the gap open up when she saw her teammate on Van der Breggen&#8217;s wheel, and even though Smulders threw herself into the chase, she couldn&#8217;t close the gap.</p>\n<p>Having entered the motor racing circuit for the finish, Smulders swung off inside the 2km mark, Longo Borghini looked around, and Reusser had no interest in chasing.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen kept going with Lippert on her wheel until the German launched her sprint with 150 metres to go to win the stage. In the group behind, Holmgren started the sprint first but was passed by Reusser, Longo Borghini and Muzic before the line.</p>\n<p>In addition to winning the mountain jersey, Gigante defended her third place overall, and AG Insurance-Soudal also won the team classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

We said, ‚ÄòOK, we accept yesterday, today we go full gas for the stage‚Äô,&#8221; said Lippert.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was also great to see the whole team was on fire, Marlen was riding for me, and I had the confidence to finish it off today, also to make Marlen happy again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The German had followed Van der Breggen‚Äôs attack in the descent towards the Imola racing track and easily dispatched Van der Breggen in the sprint.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMarlen and I both knew without talking that if Anna goes, we have to be there. In the end, I was with Anna, and it was a perfect situation for me,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started the Giro thinking ‚ÄòI will not be good here, I will not be good in the Tour‚Äô, now I‚Äôm going home with so much confidence. Our sport is like a rollercoaster, and everyone has to keep that in mind and always look for better times. They will come.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage covered 134km, ending with 3.5 laps of the 2020 World Championships circuit that finished in the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari near Imola. With a climb to Monticino as well as four ascents of the Cima Gallisterna and three climbs to Mazzolano, it was a very hilly route.</p>\n<p>Gigante won the first mountain sprint in Monticino, putting her back in the lead of the mountain classification, and the Australian would go on to win the blue mountain jersey. Then it was red jersey Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) who went on a solo breakaway, winning the intermediate sprint to confirm her victory in the points classification.</p>\n<p>Wiebes was joined by Sara Casasola (Fenix-Deceuninck) and L√©a Curinier (FDJ-Suez) the first time up the Cima Gallisterna, and when they crossed the finish line, they were 1:20 minutes ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>One lap later, the gap had fallen to just over one minute, and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek) and Mikayla Harvey (SD Worx-Protime) had bridged to the front group. Wiebes started to struggle on the climbs and was eventually dropped on the penultimate ascent of the Cima Gallisterna.</p>\n<p>At the top, 37.8km from the finish, the four escapees were 17 seconds ahead of a peloton that had been reduced to 32 riders. From that group, Lore De Schepper (AG Insurance-Soudal) launched an attack on the ridge at the top that was followed by Isabella Holmgren (Lidl-Trek) but neutralised by white jersey Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-Sram Zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>The breakaway gained time again on the way to the Autodromo and started the final lap with a 42-second advantage. An attack by Curinier led to Casasola losing contact, and on the Mazzolano climb, Spratt was dropped as well while Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Smulders reached Curinier and Harvey and led the trio over the top with a 30-second lead over the peloton, where Lieke Nooijen (Visma-Lease a Bike) had attacked just before the mountain sprint.</p>\n<p>On the steepest part of the Cima Gallisterna, Smulders accelerated and left Harvey and Curinier behind. De Schepper was now pacing in the peloton that had caught Nooijen, and the young Belgian&#8217;s pace reduced the group to less than 20 riders.</p>\n<p>When De Schepper swung off, Gigante accelerated even more, blowing the group apart as only Niedermaier, Lippert, Reusser, Holmgren, Longo Borghini, and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health) could follow her move.</p>\n<p>Smulders crested the climb only four seconds ahead of the chase group that was now led by Rooijakkers, who, like Van der Breggen, had come back on the last part of the climb. Rooijakkers&#8217; attack on the ridge was shut down by Holmgren. √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez) and Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) also returned to the group.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Reusser took up the chase behind Smulders, with Holmgren also taking a turn, and the lone attacker was reeled in 5.8km from the finish. Holmgren attacked just before the 5km mark but immediately had Reusser in her wheel.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen was next to try, putting the pressure on in the descent and causing Malcotti, Magnaldi, Holmgren, Rooijakkers, and Gigante to lose contact, though all five riders came back around the 3km mark. Van der Breggen took a breather, letting Reusser lead the group for a while before launching another move that was followed by Lippert.</p>\n<p>Reusser looked across and let the gap open up when she saw her teammate on Van der Breggen&#8217;s wheel, and even though Smulders threw herself into the chase, she couldn&#8217;t close the gap.</p>\n<p>Having entered the motor racing circuit for the finish, Smulders swung off inside the 2km mark, Longo Borghini looked around, and Reusser had no interest in chasing.</p>\n<p>Van der Breggen kept going with Lippert on her wheel until the German launched her sprint with 150 metres to go to win the stage. In the group behind, Holmgren started the sprint first but was passed by Reusser, Longo Borghini and Muzic before the line.</p>\n<p>In addition to winning the mountain jersey, Gigante defended her third place overall, and AG Insurance-Soudal also won the team classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route then tackled the final climb leading to the first pass over the finish line, and the start of the 15km finishing circuit.</p>\n<p>Attacks came thick and fast from the start, with Liv AlUla Jayco and EF Education-Oatly particularly active, but no riders managed to gain a lasting advantage as the peloton approached San Marino for the day‚Äôs first QOM.

First, we controlled the breakaway with the team, and then we put the race in the gutter a bit together with UAE Team ADQ. The peloton broke, because and we were there with a lot of girls, that was really good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had to finish it off, and the girls did amazing again, with Barbara [Guarischi] and Lotte [Kopecky] as lead-out, it&#8217;s really great to have them,&#8221; Wiebes thanked her teammates after her second stage victory within three days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also important for the GC for Anna.

Although the wind speeds were only around 10km/h, the peloton soon split into several groups. While most of those groups quickly came back together, the front echelon kept going and steadily increased its advantage.</p>\n<p>UAE Team ADQ were represented with Longo Borghini, Alena Amialiusik, Brodie Chapman, Eleonora Gasparrini, and Silvia Persico while SD Worx-Protime had Lotte Kopecky, Elena Cecchini, Barbara Guarischi, Van der Breggen, and Wiebes in the group.

I&#8217;m coming back from a big surgery. I had six months off after iliac artery endofibrosis, and then I dislocated my shoulder just as I was coming back, so it&#8217;s been a long time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is by far my biggest win, especially in Europe, so I&#8217;m just so grateful to my team for always believing in me, not just this week, but ever since I joined the team.

The two riders had attacked from the peloton with 41.4km to go and built an advantage of more than three minutes before the climb to Aprica began.</p>\n<p>Although the peloton steadily reduced the gap, at the flamme rouge it was clear that the two escapees would sprint for the stage. Miermont led onto the finishing straight, and Henderson launched her sprint in the last 200 metres, easily passing the Frenchwoman to win.</p>\n<p>Twenty six seconds later, Soraya Paladin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) led home the reduced peloton that contained many of the main GC riders.</p>\n<p>Starting the stage 27 seconds down on race leader Marlen Reusser (Movistar), who finished in the Paladin group, Henderson also takes the pink jersey going into stage 3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Pink is my favourite colour!&#8221; Henderson exclaimed in the finish area when she heard that she was the new GC leader.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAs a team, we made the plan to be aggressive because we knew it would be a hard final and we have a really good team for attacking. They gave us three minutes. I knew that once we had two minutes at the bottom [of the climb], we could make it, and I just kept working,&#8221; Henderson continued in the official post-race interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We‚Äôre here for stages, this is what we came to do, and I‚Äôm so thankful for my teammates for supporting me.

After descending into the Val Camonica, the road was gently uphill for most of the day, punctuated by an unclassified climb to Bienno. The last 14km were the official finishing climb to Aprica, with a steep section 12km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Although several riders tried their luck, no breakaway succeeded in getting away at first, and the peloton covered 42.7km in the first hour of racing. Finally, Miermont made her move and was followed by Henderson. They kept going and quickly had a one-minute advantage while Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) changed one of her shoes without stepping off the bike.</p>\n<p>Yurani Blanco (Human Powered Health) went on the chase behind the two frontrunners with 32km to go but ended up on a fruitless chase between the front and the peloton. At the intermediate sprint in Malonno, Henderson and Miermont were 2:32 minutes ahead of Blanco, the peloton following at 3:04 minutes.</p>\n<p>Blanco was reeled in before the peloton passed the 20km mark, 2:55 minutes behind Henderson and Miermont, but as the pace picked up, the gap had been reduced to 2:10 minutes with 15km left to the finish.</p>\n<p>Sarah Gigante and Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (both AG Insurance-Soudal) pushed hard on the steepest part of the climb to Aprica, seriously reducing the gap to the frontrunners as well as the size of the peloton, with Lotte Kopecky, Lorena Wiebes (both SD Worx-Protime), and Vos among the dropped riders. Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility) attacked out of the group twice, but her moves were quickly neutralised.</p>\n<p>Pink jersey Marlen Reusser then launched an attack herself with 10km to go that strung out the group. Only Aalerud could hold her wheel while Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) had to leave a gap. Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) realised the danger and jumped across, and soon the pace went out again.</p>\n<p>At the 5km to go mark, Henderson and Miermont were 59 seconds ahead of a reduced peloton of 21 riders while Vos and her teammates were chasing another 30 seconds behind. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) took charge at the front of the peloton and reduced the gap to 33 seconds with 3km to go, but the two escapees held on to sprint for the stage, with Henderson crossing the line first.</p>\n<p>The GC group finished 26 seconds down on the winner in the end, though notably missing from that group was Kopecky, who conceded 2:08 on the first real climb of this year&#8217;s Giro.</p>\n<p>With her stage victory, Henderson also takes the lead in the points and mountains classifications, but as she has the pink GC leader‚Äôs jersey on her shoulders on stage 3, Miermont gets to sport the red points jersey while Paladin will wear the blue mountain jersey.

The race will take place from 6 to 13 July, and will be the 21st event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) won stage 1 of the Giro d&#8217;Italia Women, a 14.2km individual time trial in Bergamo. The Swiss ITT champion set the best time at the intermediate timing point after two thirds of the course and kept going to the finish, stopping the clock with a time of 17:22.</p>\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) and Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) could not match Reusser‚Äôs time, finishing second and third, 12 and 16 seconds slower, respectively.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited, and I can almost not believe that we won. It feels a little bit surreal,&#8221; said Reusser in the winner‚Äôs interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was not sure how good my TT is, and it‚Äôs really a big dream of mine to win here and to wear pink. I was like, ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs good enough‚Äô, now I won, I‚Äôm super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe opening time trial consisted of two distinct parts. After the start at Bergamo ChorusLife, it began with a very straightforward out-and-back stretch to the intermediate timing point after 8.75km. Then the last third was far more technical with lots of corners before the race ended on the Sentierone, a broad avenue in the very centre of Bergamo.</p>\n<p>Lauretta Hanson (Lidl-Trek) was the first rider to set a benchmark time, finishing in 18:14, but she barely made it to the hot seat before Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health) went a second faster.</p>\n<p>Edwards‚Äô time stood for longer, eventually beaten by Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility) as the Norwegian ITT champion finished in 18:06. Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek) was the first to stay below 18 minutes, taking a lot of time off the clock with 17:49.</p>\n<p>It took a long time before anyone even remotely challenged that benchmark. German ITT champion Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) finished in 18:10, enough to take the white jersey for the best U23 rider at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>On her return to WorldTour racing after sitting out the first half of the year with injury, Lieke Nooijen (Visma-Lease a Bike) was six seconds slower than Henderson at the intermediate time. But the 23-year-old Dutchwoman then excelled in the technical final and finished in 17:46.</p>\n<p>However, Nooijen never made it to the hot seat as Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) went four seconds faster again in 17:42, almost immediately afterwards. Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) suffered a mechanical and had to change bikes, ending any hopes of a top result. Christina Schweinberger (Fenix-Deceuninck) was a second faster than Van der Breggen at the intermediate time but lost time in the end to finish in 17:52.</p>\n<p>By that point, Reusser had started, and she flew across the out-and-back part, setting an intermediate time that was 14 seconds faster than Schweinberger. Reusser was also the fastest through the technical last third to stop the clock after 17:22, 20 seconds better than Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p>European ITT champion Kopecky and 2024 Giro overall winner Longo Borghini did their best to challenge Reusser, but they were four and six seconds behind at the intermediate timing point and lost more time on the way to the finish, taking second and third place on the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9064&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event was established in 1899, a professional championship was established in 1907 and the women&#8217;s championship was established in 1951. Several additional categories were added later. The winners of each event are awarded with a symbolic cycling jersey which is blue, white and red, just like the national flag, these colours can be worn by the rider at other road racing events in the country to show their status as national champion. The champion&#8217;s stripes can be combined into a sponsored rider&#8217;s team kit design for this purpose.</p>\n<p>It was a maiden elite national title for Marie Le Net (FDJ-Suez) as the 25-year-old soloed to victory in the French national championships road race in Les Herbiers after a day in the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Le Net was part of the early three- then seven-rider move that went after 20km of racing, and with 17km she attacked with Julie Bego (Cofidis). With 8km to go, she attacked again, this time going solo, and she wouldn&#8217;t be seen again, riding to a tricolour jersey at the finish.</p>\n<p>Her teammate L√©a Curinier, who joined the leaders just before Le Net&#8217;s winning attack, finished second, outsprinting Bego who had to settle for third.</p>\n<p>The biggest team in the race, FDJ-Suez played the day to perfection, placing Le Net in the first break that went and then sending Curinier to join her. With two riders in the lead, they exempted themselves from the chase, which meant the leaders built up a solid gap that would never be closed.</p>\n<p>Le Net and Bego were the strongest on the climbs, attacking their companions on the final lap, and then just as Curinier bridged across to them, Le Net launched again, using her to descending skills to escape to victory.</p>\n<p>Le Net could not hold back the tears in her winner&#8217;s interview, saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what has just happened&#8221; and &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>At the start of the race, it took a while for a breakaway to get away and stay away, with various attacks but nothing sticking until 20km of the 115km race had already been completed, when a group of three went up the road.</p>\n<p>That breakaway was formed of Let Net, Bego and Cl√©mence Latimier (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels). They built up a lead of two and a half minutes, and after some more attacks, grew to six as Curinier and the Winspace Orange Seal duo of Constance Valentin and Marine Allione.</p>\n<p>With 40km to go, the leading group still had a three-minute ‚Äì and growing ‚Äì gap, with the small peloton size making it harder for a concerted chase to come together. With two riders in the lead, FDJ ‚Äì the biggest team in the race ‚Äì had no reason to chase, and the gap went up to four minutes.</p>\n<p>Into the final 30km, the attacks began from the main group, and the gap did shrink, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to fully close it, and ultimately it was down to the breakaway riders to contest for the win.</p>\n<p>Le Net takes the blue, white and red jersey from teammate Juliette Labous, who finished 12th on Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14378&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14378&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1888, today it is organized by the Top Sports Group, commissioned by the KNWU.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) sprinted to a dominant victory in the women&#8217;s road race at the Dutch national championships, winning by a big margin in Ede after surviving a crash-hit final 10km.</p>\n<p>No one could match the speed an acceleration of the European champion in the final straight, with Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL) finishing second, several metres behind Wiebes. Nienke Veenhoven (Visma-Lease a Bike) finished fast to take third, just pipping Puck Langenbarg (Fenix-Deceuninck Development) on the line.</p>\n<p>Langenbarg took fourth, which earnt her the U23 national title.</p>\n<p>A big crash in the middle of the peloton with 6km to go took out many of the favourites, including Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) and Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), who struggled to get back into contention with SD Worx-Protime setting a furious pace towards the sprint.</p>\n<p>Another crash in the final kilometre saw Wiebes&#8217; teammate TT champion Mischa Bredewold hit the deck, but that clearly didn&#8217;t cost the Dutchwoman who powered to her second elite national title.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The team worked super hard for it. The girls did a good lead out,&#8221; Wiebes told NOS. &#8220;I expected Charlotte Kool to go early, but luckily I was able to catch it well and continue. I saw it happening, so I was able to react quickly. I was still able to tell [Femke Gerritse] that I would pass on the right, so that she wouldn‚Äôt close the gap.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last twenty kilometers, the girls rode full throttle at the front, if not longer,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Then you feel the pressure to finish it off, but it worked out perfectly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the largely flat course around Ede and its surrounds, the race was very aggressive and hard to control, with riders like Vos kicking off the attacks in the second half of the race, as many riders tried to force a finish that would be more selective than just a sprint.</p>\n<p>A chaotic final 20km saw an ever-changing rotation of escapees as dozens riders tried to attack, and many were away for a few kilometres at a time.</p>\n<p>Four riders went into the final 10km ahead of the bunch ‚Äì Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike), Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit), Maud Rijnbeek (VolkerWessels) and Mareille Meijering (Movistar) ‚Äì but they never had a big margin, and the work of SD Worx-Protime saw them caught ahead of the finish, with the dominant Dutch team getting the sprint finish they wanted.</p>\n<p>The big crash in the finale ended the chances of multiple riders, including Vollering and Vos, but by that point it was likely too late for any more attacks.</p>\n<p>This is Wiebes fourth win in a row, in a winning streak that started on the final stage of the Tour of Britain Women, and saw her take wins at Dwars door het Hageland and the Copenhagen Sprint as she continues as the undisputed best sprinter in the women&#8217;s peloton.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14374&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14374&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event was established in 1899, a professional championship was established in 1907 and the women&#8217;s championship was established in 1951. Several additional categories were added later. The winners of each event are awarded with a symbolic cycling jersey which is blue, white and red, just like the national flag, these colours can be worn by the rider at other road racing events in the country to show their status as national champion. The champion&#8217;s stripes can be combined into a sponsored rider&#8217;s team kit design for this purpose.</p>\n<p>A broken radio and lack of time references proved no obstacle for C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) to dominate the field in the French women&#8217;s national time trial championships.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol finished an impressive 36 seconds quicker than Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ) in the 26.5-kilometre course at Les Herbiers, securing her second time trial crown in three years.</p>\n<p>The 24-year-old opened up a convincing gap at the first intermediate time check and remained well ahead of her rivals for the rest of the course.</p>\n<p>Labous, four times second and the 2020 Champion, made a slower start before increasing her pace in the second half. But she was unable to get back on terms with Kerbaol, on the podium for the third time in three years.</p>\n<p>Third place went to Marion Borras (Cofidis), 1:07 down, with up-and-coming Sol√®ne Muller (Entente Cycliste Thaonnaise) a surprising fourth. Despite her comparatively young age, the 21-year-old was 15 seconds further adrift of the podium finishers</p>\n<p>This year&#8217;s time trial nationals&#8217; battle had a markedly different feel to recent editions, given the absence of seven-time winner and defending champion Audrey Cordon-Ragot, who retired at the end of 2024. But Kerbaol proved more than up to the challenge of going one better than her silver medal in last year&#8217;s equivalent event.</p>\n<p>The last rider to start the hilly course in western France, Kerbaol quickly made her presence known by crushing the best time set by the 21-year-old Muller at the first time split. Despite her radio stopping working, she said, and a lack of any time references, she was still able to win on race instinct alone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My radio stopped working so I had to just listen to my body and my legs, to just stay in my bubble,&#8221; Kerbaol said afterwards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had absolutely no info so I had to focus on my effort. It was only at the last moment, when I crossed the line, that I knew I was ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14368&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14368&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Poland tried to go for the second town sprint in Ganl√∏se but was outsprinted by Tacey, Borgstr√∂m, and De Grave. A large central reservation then caused a crash in the peloton that took down over a dozen riders, including Balsamo and four of her Lidl-Trek teammates. Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Cindy Pomares (CJ O‚ÄôShea), and Nora Tveit (DAS-Hutchinson) had to abandon the race.</p>\n<p>Only a few kilometres later, there was a second crash as a rider hit the protective haybale tied to a bollard head-on.

She dropped De Grave and Borgstr√∂m, but Tacey jumped across and soon dropped Poland herself.</p>\n<p>Tacey won the final town sprint in R√∏dovre, but the peloton then reeled her in on the hill of Valby Bakke. On the city centre circuit, the sprinters‚Äô teams controlled proceedings, keeping the pace high enough to discourage any attacks, and a big peloton entered the final lap together.</p>\n<p>Danish champion Rebecca Koerner (Uno-X Mobility) and Georgia Baker (Liv AlUla Jayco) crashed as they turned left onto the cobbles of Adelgade with 8.5km to go. Although only two riders hit the deck, this crash split the peloton as many riders were held up, and the speed was high on the final lap.</p>\n<p>Only some 30 riders remained in front, and although more riders got back on, it was a reduced peloton that entered the final kilometres. Picnic PostNL surged to the front at the 2km mark, entering the right-hand turn into N√∏rre All√© at the front with Josie Nelson, Pfeiffer Georgi, and Megan Jastrab ahead of Kool.</p>\n<p>Georgi led the field through the penultimate turn on Skt. Hans Torv but was too strong for Jastrab, who had to leave a small gap. At the flamme rouge, Lidl-Trek came alongside with Fleur Moors and Clara Copponi leading out Balsamo, and Guarischi jumped from Kool‚Äôs wheel to that of Moors to get the optimal line through the final corner for herself and Wiebes.</p>\n<p>On the 900-metre finishing straight, Georgi was still pulling at the front with the Lidl-Trek train on her wheel until Guarischi began her lead-out on Fredens Bro with 550 metres to go. Kool was in Guarischi‚Äôs wheel, followed by Wiebes, who had Balsamo and Consonni jostling for position behind her.</p>\n<p>Wiebes started her sprint 200 metres from the line, and Kool hesitated briefly before launching herself.

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) has won the 2025 Tour de Suisse Women. Wearing the yellow jersey since her stage 1 victory, the 33-year-old Swiss allrounder won the final stage to seal her GC victory.</p>\n<p>Reusser set the pace on the final climb, the steep Michaelskreuzstrasse, then attacked after the descent with 9.5km to go and soloed to the finish to conclude a big stage race win in style.</p>\n<p>28 seconds down, Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) beat Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) in the sprint for second place, but Vollering finishes overall runner-up, 36 seconds down, ahead of Niewiadoma-Phinney, who finishes 1:56 off Reusser.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great, I&#8217;m really, really, really happy,&#8221; Reusser said after the finish.</p>\n<p>Having missed much of the 2024 season due to post-Covid syndrome, Reusser is now back at the top and prefers to focus on the here and now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just back in life and super happy. On a day like today, I don&#8217;t think about last year. I just enjoy this day, and I really enjoyed the race. I enjoyed the crowd, I was very impressed how many people we had at the side of the road, I heard my name and encouragement all over the place, it was really, really nice,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>More and more, Reusser is emerging as the top challenger for Vollering.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we have this rivalry the whole year, and I&#8217;m just making so many steps at this moment, I&#8217;m really levelling up a lot, and I think it will keep being interesting,&#8221; finished Reusser.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 129.4km stage starting and finishing in K√ºssnacht began with a circuit that included the climbs of the Adligenwilerstrasse and Michaelskreuzstrasse followed by a mainly-flat loop alongside Lake Zug, Lake Lauerz and Lake Luzern before finishing with another lap of the Adligenwilerstrasse and Michaelskreuzstrasse.</p>\n<p>Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) led the peloton over the first Adligenwilerstrasse QOM, and this would eventually be enough to win her the red mountain jersey. Afterwards, a break of five riders got away, but only Afghan champion Fariba Hashimi (Ceratizit) was left at the front at the top of the steep Michaelskreuzstrasse, less than 30 seconds ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>After Hashimi was caught, 11 riders briefly formed a new front group, then Mikayla Harvey (SD Worx-Protime) and Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) held a five-second gap for about ten kilometres.</p>\n<p>Henrietta Christie (EF Education-Oatly) attacked with 64km to go and quickly built a 55-second advantage, but continuing attacks in the peloton and FDJ-Suez setting Vollering up for the two bonus sprints within a kilometre of each other brought the gap down to 13 seconds.</p>\n<p>Christie won both bonus sprints, Vollering snatched two bonus seconds in the first one while Reusser took the remaining one-second bonification.</p>\n<p>Steffi H√§berlin (SD Worx-Protime) and Julia Borgstr√∂m (AG Insurance-Soudal) then attacked between the two sprints, taking the bonus seconds at the second sprint and bridging to Christie soon after.</p>\n<p>At the Adligenwilerstrasse QOM, H√§berlin, Borgstr√∂m, and Christie were 24 seconds ahead of the chasing peloton where Lidl-Trek and FDJ-Suez did most of the work, reeling in the break with 19km to go, just before the foot of the Michaelskreuzstrasse.</p>\n<p>Climbing 3.9km at an average 9.1%, it was a fierce climb to decide the race, and Reusser took charge right away, setting the pace from the bottom. Halfway up, only Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) remained with Reusser, but C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a Bike), Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), Sarah Gigante, and Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (both AG Insurance-Soudal) managed to return one kilometre from the top.</p>\n<p>An acceleration by Fisher-Black could not drop any of the other eight riders, but when Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked 500 metres from the QOM point, the group fractured as only Fisher-Black, Reusser, and Vollering could follow.</p>\n<p>These four riders crested the climb together, and Niewiadoma-Phinney and Reusser pushed hard on the descent. Fisher-Black was dropped, but Vollering stayed with them. Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked again with 11km to go, quickly getting a gap as Reusser let Vollering do the chasing.</p>\n<p>Reusser then attacked from behind, and Vollering was unable to reply to her acceleration as the Swiss yellow jersey flew past Niewiadoma-Phinney. At the finish line, Reusser had opened a gap of 28 seconds and could celebrate the stage as well as the overall victory.</p>\n<p>With two stage victories, she also won the black points jersey. Bunel leapfrogged Eleonora Ciabocco (Picnic PostNL) in GC to win the white U23 jersey, Lidl-Trek took the team classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

These new attacks were quickly reeled in, though, and although there were more attacks on the run-in to K√ºssnacht, the stage came down to a sprint from a group of 34 riders.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) gained one second on Marlen Reusser (Movistar) at the day‚Äôs bonus sprints and goes into the final stage with a three-second deficit on the Swiss rider in the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nCovering 123.1km from the Campus Sursee in Oberkirch to K√ºssnacht, the stage was mostly flat (the Swiss kind of flat) as it went past six different lakes. There were still two classified climbs, though, the B√∂√∂ler Passh√∂chi and the Aegeristrasse.</p>\n<p>Faulkner‚Äôs gap to the peloton increased steadily until she was 1:45 minutes ahead with 47km to go, then the peloton took up the chase, preparing for the two bonus sprints on the Tissot Kilometre with 39 and 38km to go. Faulkner took three bonus seconds in both, but behind her, Vollering picked up three bonus seconds while Reusser got two.</p>\n<p>Faulkner was only 20 seconds ahead now but held a small gap to the QOM point on the Aegeristrasse. Soon afterwards, Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit) attacked and bridged to the lone leader, quickly followed by Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>When this move was caught, Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike) launched the next attack that did not get away and was countered by C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) with Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) on her wheel, adding a bit of GC action to the stage.</p>\n<p>De Vries, Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez), Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco), and white jersey Eleonora Ciabocco (Picnic PostNL) jumped across the gap, and eventually the move was reeled in with 31km to go.</p>\n<p>Wyllie attacked again 11km from the finish, together with Hengeveld and Ricarda Bauernfeind (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), but they never had a big gap, and after more riders bridged from the peloton, their move was brought back with 8km to go.</p>\n<p>Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL) made her move 7km from the line and was followed by Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), Kraak, and De Vries, but they were reeled before the 5km mark. Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) crashed with 3.7km to go, but as she managed to chase back to the peloton, the Spaniard did not lose any time in GC.</p>\n<p>Reusser was brought onto the penultimate kilometre by her teammates Floortje Mackaij and Mareille Meijering, then Kerbaol took over with R√ºegg on her wheel before Emma Norsgaard (Lidl-Trek) came to the front at the flamme rouge with Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Vas moved up through the technical last kilometre and was first at the 400-metre mark with Balsamo and Bredewold on her wheel, opening up a gap. Balsamo then launched her long sprint, and although Bredewold came alongside on the last 75 metres, it was Balsamo who was first to the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Amber Kraak (FDJ-SUEZ) won stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse Women. She attacked from a long-range breakaway on the last climb of the day, dropping her companions and starting a 25-kilometre solo strike. Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) finished second, 1:55 down, after turning into the deviation on the final kilometre but quickly realising her mistake and returning on course.</p>\n<p>√âlise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) won the sprint for third against Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney at 2:43 back, while FDJ-SUEZ&#8217;s Demi Vollering and Marlen Reusser (Movistar) led home the next group at just over 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>Kraak, Lach, Carina Schrempf (Fenix-Deceuninck), Henrietta Christie (EF Education-Oatly), and Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) had gone clear from the peloton 56km into the 161.7km stage.</p>\n<p>Skalniak-S√≥jka lost contact on the Schallenberg climb, the other four stayed together until the Buecheh√ºbeli. Kraak had been sitting on at the back of the group, protecting the GC position of her team leader Vollering, but as their advantage over the peloton had become smaller, she decided to go for it alone on the final climb.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI suffered really a lot [in the heat]. Last week I was still in the Women‚Äôs Tour [of Britain] with nine degrees and full of rain, so yesterday I had a really tough day. Today I felt a little bit better, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I had the best day when I was in the break.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had to be there to be a relay for later in the race for Demi. But in the end, the gap was so big, and then we decided to go for the win,‚Äù said Kraak.</p>\n<p>The stage win is her second Women‚Äôs WorldTour victory after the final stage of the 2024 UAE Tour Women.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s really special, this is now my fourth year as a pro cyclist, and my second WorldTour win. It‚Äôs amazing that it goes this way, and especially with this team. With such good GC riders behind, you can play a bit more, and sometimes you have to work really hard, but other times you can get something back,‚Äù Kraak finished.</p>\n<p>There were no big changes in GC where Reusser still leads by four seconds to Vollering and 1:21 to Niewiadoma-Phinney.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOn the way from Gstaad to the Campus Sursee in Oberkirch, the riders had to tackle three classified climbs &#8211; the long but not particularly steep Schallenberg, the steep wall of Wintermatt, and finally the 5.7km, 6.1% climb of Buecheh√ºbeli, cresting 19.3km from the finish.</p>\n<p>The five escapees &#8211; Kraak, Lach, Schrempf, Christie and Skalniak-S√≥jka &#8211; quickly built a gap of several minutes, and although Skalniak-S√≥jka was dropped with 89km to go, the other four continued undeterred. At the Schallenberg QOM, they were 5:26 ahead, and at the intermediate sprint in Escholzmatt, this had even increased to 6:34.</p>\n<p>The Wintermatt climb saw the peloton take up the chase for real, though, and at the top, only 4:15 separated the break from the group of about 20 riders that had stayed together on the climb. Wearing the white U23 jersey, Eleonora Ciabocco (Picnic PostNL) then attacked from the peloton on the descent and quickly gained over a minute.</p>\n<p>At the start of the Buecheh√ºbeli climb, the four escapees were 2:50 ahead of Ciabocco and just over four minutes up on what remained of the peloton. Kraak went to the front right away and pushed hard, fracturing the group as each rider climbed at her own pace. At the QOM, Kraak had gained 1:34 on Lach while Schrempf and Christie were 3:10 behind.</p>\n<p>Ciabocco followed at 3:28 with Niewiadoma-Phinney at 3:40. The Polish all-rounder had made two moves on the climb before finally breaking free, cresting the climb 21 seconds ahead of the other GC riders.</p>\n<p>Niewiadoma-Phinney caught up with Ciabocco on the descent, and together they reeled in Schrempf and Christie. On the flat run-in to the finish, a group with Reusser, Vollering, Chabbey, Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek), Garc√≠a, Noemi R√ºegg, and C√©drine Kerbaol (both EF Education-Oatly) came back, forming a group of 11 riders.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol tried to get away but only succeeded in stringing the group out in single file. Garc√≠a launched her move and got a gap, with Niewiadoma-Phinney and Chabbey bridging to the Spaniard. This trio crossed the finish line 30 seconds ahead of the others, taking back some time in GC. Up front, though, Kraak‚Äôs stage victory was never in doubt.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) won stage 1 of the Tour de Suisse Women, beating Demi Vollering (FDJ-SUEZ) in a sprint √† deux in Gstaad. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) finished third from a chase group of three, 1:41 minutes behind.</p>\n<p>Reusser attacked after the top of the first-category Jaunpass, flying down the descent, and Vollering bridged to her with considerable effort. From there, they effectively rode a pair TT together for 57km, sharing the time bonifications at the two bonus sprints and building an advantage of over two minutes on the chase group of Niewiadoma-Phinney, Niamh Fisher-Black, and Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart, with the next group even further back.</p>\n<p>Reusser attacked 2.2km from the finish line but could not shake Vollering who then stayed on Reusser&#8217;s wheel all the way to the finishing straight which meant that their advantage shrank again.</p>\n<p>Vollering started her sprint with 250 metres to go, and it looked like she had beaten Reusser, but the Swiss woman came back and passed Vollering on the last 100 metres to win the stage and take the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt all went perfect, perfect, perfect, and I‚Äôm super happy. I think she [Vollering] went a bit early [in the sprint], it was perfect,‚Äù Reusser was happy about her stage win in the post-race interview.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was really our plan to make it a very, very small group, or if I‚Äôm alone, even, we didn‚Äôt care either. After that climbing, when the climb is hard, it‚Äôs going to be small groups that all have to push. There will be people looking at each other, there will not be so much cohesion, so you know that with not too big of an effort, you can go pretty far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought even if a group would come back, everybody needed to work, so it‚Äôs not so risky,‚Äù Reusser explained her long-range attack.</p>\n<p>She now leads the GC with four seconds on Vollering and 1:51 minutes to Niewiadoma.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs the goal [to defend the yellow jersey], although I have to say, it‚Äôs not going to be easy, and the result, we will see in the end. But we will try, of course,‚Äù finished Reusser.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing in Gstaad, the stage covered 95.5km on a large anti-clockwise loop through the Berner Oberland and parts of the cantons of Fribourg and Vaud. The two climbs of the Sannenm√∂ser and Jaunpass came in the first third of the stage, with the rest of the stage mainly flat (for Switzerland, that is).</p>\n<p>The peloton stayed together over the Sannenm√∂ser climb where Morgane Coston (Roland) took the QOM points, but the lower slopes of the Jaunpass reduced the peloton to about 30 riders as Movistar set a hard pace.</p>\n<p>Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked 4km from the top, but when Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal) went after her and closed the gap, she brought the rest of the peloton with her.</p>\n<p>Gigante attacked again 3.1km from the top, and when Reusser, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering ≈Ωigart, C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), Fisher-Black, and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) reeled her in with 2.2km to the QOM sprint, the selection was made.</p>\n<p>Garc√≠a and Kerbaol couldn‚Äôt follow the pace that was set by Reusser and Gigante, and the Australian led the group of six over the QOM summit, taking maximum points and moving into the red mountain jersey.</p>\n<p>After a breather at the back of the group, Reusser attacked into the descent, quickly opening a gap. Only Vollering was able to come back halfway down the mountain, and the two former teammates settled into a steady rhythm, trading turns equally on the way back to Gstaad.</p>\n<p>They rolled through the Tissot kilometre, two bonus sprints within 1,000 metres of each other at 16km and 15km to go, with Vollering taking the first one and Reusser the second, both gaining five bonus seconds each. Behind them by 1:37, Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked her companions Fisher-Black and ≈Ωigart to take the two remaining bonus seconds before sitting up again. The group of 23 riders behind those three was 2:50 down.</p>\n<p>In the final, the gap to the chase group had risen to over two minutes, but when Reusser attacked and Vollering did not let her get away, Vollering refused to take any more turns on the last two kilometres. This cat-and-mouse game meant that the chase groups made up time again, finishing at 1:42 and 2:14, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I‚Äôm so happy, first of all, a massive thank you to my teammates, I couldn‚Äôt have done it without them. This means the world to me, it‚Äôs my first WorldTour victory in GC,&#8221; said Wollaston on the podium on Glasgow Green.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I needed to get every second I could in the bonus sprints, and unfortunately, Cat was right in my wheel every time! So it came down to the last sprint, and there was a moment of doubt halfway through that last lap where I thought ‚ÄòI just cannot do this today‚Äô, and my teammates really helped me pull it together and pulled me to the front for the final.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage was held on an 8.4km city-centre circuit in Glasgow. With the start of the first lap neutralised, ten laps came out to a total of 82.2km of racing, with intermediate sprints offering time bonuses after the fourth, sixth, and eighth lap.</p>\n<p>Kool suffered a mechanical on lap 2 but quickly returned to the peloton. On lap 3, Anna Morris (Great Britain) launched a solo attack that lasted for a few kilometres before she was caught again.</p>\n<p>At the end of lap 4, Ferguson was first through the last corner with 170 metres to go and looked like the winner of the first intermediate sprint, but Wollaston squeezed past on the final metres to take three bonus seconds ahead of two for Ferguson, making up one second of her three-second deficit.</p>\n<p>Wollaston beat Ferguson to the line in the second intermediate sprint, too, and now sat only one second behind the green jersey. Ferguson continued the ‚Äòcurse of the leader‚Äôs jersey‚Äô ‚Äì after bad luck for Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) on stages 2 and 3, Ferguson had a mechanical halfway through lap 5.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old Yorkshirewoman never panicked, did an excellent bike change and soon rejoined the back of the peloton. Her teammates brought her back to the front, and Ferguson was second in the last intermediate sprint, again behind Wollaston who now had the same time as the green jersey, setting up an exciting sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Morris attacked again on lap 9 and was ten seconds ahead as the bell rang for the final lap, but she was reeled in with just over 5km to go. On the turn into Glasgow Green, Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) took the front with Wiebes in her wheel, and the European champion launched her sprint at the 300-metre mark, going first through the final corner before accelerating again to win by several bike lengths to Kool.</p>\n<p>Behind Wiebes and Kool, Wollaston was piloted into third position by her teammate C√©lia Gery and kept this to the line, taking the last bonus seconds to win the overall classification. FDJ-Suez also won the team classification while Ferguson took the white U23 jersey and the red points jersey. Dominika W≈Çodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) won the blue QOM jersey, and Grace Lister (Hess) was the best-placed local Continental rider in 15th place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was useful that we&#8217;d done it before, in the intermediate sprint. I knew it was better to be second wheel and then launch first because you lose some momentum on the cobbles, and it&#8217;s hard to build it back up. So I didn&#8217;t look back and just kept going,&#8221; the 19-year-old described the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit nervous now, to be honest, it&#8217;s going to be a rough night&#8217;s sleep, I think. I really want to hold on to this jersey that I didn&#8217;t think I would be in, so we have to look and make a plan to hold on to it for tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see how it goes around the streets of Glasgow, I&#8217;ve raced there before, and we&#8217;ve got a strong and motivated team. We&#8217;ll do our best to defend it,&#8221; Ferguson said about the upcoming final stage.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing in Kelso, the stage consisted of a longer and a shorter loop around the Scottish Borders for a distance of 143.8 km. The longer loop included the climbs of Scott&#8217;s View, Dingleton, and Dunion Hill, with the first two being climbed again on the shorter loop.</p>\n<p>The peloton stayed together over the first ascent of Scott&#8217;s View, with Dominika W≈Çodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) taking maximum QOM points. Overnight leader Kristen Faulkner (EF Education) suffered a mechanical and changed to the bike of her teammate Babette van der Wolff.</p>\n<p>Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez) attacked on the Dingleton climb, cresting it a few seconds ahead of the chasing peloton but was caught a couple of kilometres later. After a flurry of unsuccessful attacks, the pace dropped again, allowing Faulkner and other dropped riders to return.</p>\n<p>It started to rain heavily as the stage went on, and W≈Çodarczyk was first at the top again which made her the leader of the QOM classification when Mara Roldan (Picnic PostNL) crashed out of the race.</p>\n<p>This happened on a wet descent with 56km to go. Roldan was in third position going into a right-hand turn but slipped and crashed, immediately followed by dozens of other riders including Faulkner, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime), and Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal).</p>\n<p>The race had split completely because of the mass crash, and it took a while before riders came back to form a peloton of just over riders. Wollaston won the intermediate sprint in Kelso ahead of Ferguson and C√©lia Gery (FDJ-Suez), but the descent saw another crash where, among others, Faulkner went to the ground again. She had to switch one of her shoes afterwards and was on the back foot from there on, eventually finishing over three minutes behind and dropping out of the GC race.</p>\n<p>Up front, Uttrup Ludwig attacked on the second ascent of Dingleton, initiating the decisive move. Unfortunately for the Dane, she lost contact with the other five due to her mechanical, and the last 20km were a long-range chase between the frontrunners and the next group on the road ‚Äì with the front group going all the way to the finish where Ferguson won the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Created in 2024, the event is part of the International Cycling Union calendar in category 2.1. Previously, a one-day women&#8217;s race called ReVolta took place in the region from 2018 to 2023. It is decided in 2023 that the event will be transformed into a complete tour.</p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey made a perfectly-timed late-race attack on a three-way breakaway to secure a solo victory and the first leader&#8217;s jersey on the opening stage at the Volta Ciclista a Catalunya Femenina. </p>\n<p>It was a one-two finish for FDJ-SUEZ as Demi Vollering out-sprinted Ane Santesteban (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) for second place in Reus.</p>\n<p>Chabbey now leads the overall GC by nice seconds ahead of Vollering and 13 seconds ahead of Santesteban, with stage 2 on Saturday bringing an uphill finish to favour her climbing ability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t even find the words. For me, it means so much to win a bike race. I&#8217;m not a cyclist that wins a lot so this is really important for me. I am so happy,&#8221; Chabbey said in a post-race interview about her victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to thank the whole team, and Demi, because she was the strongest but it was the plan that I go a bit earlier and try to create a break, and she would jump and bridge and we would be together. It was perfect. In the end, she told me to attack and go for it. I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The opening stage at the Volta Ciclista a Catalunya Femenina offered a hilly 114.4km from El Perello to Reus with three categorised ascents at Coll del Guix (14.6km at 3.2%), Coll de Porrera (3.3km at 6.8%) and Coll d&#8217;Alforia (5km at 4.6%), followed by mostly descending all the way into Reus.</p>\n<p>The first separation from the peloton was by US rider Allison Mrugal (Cynisca Cycling) and South American Agua Maria Espinola (Team Farto-Kiroot), but went no farther than the 30 kilometres. With 50 kilometers to go to the finish, on the climb to the Coll de Porrera, a decisive move saw three riders escape.</p>\n<p>The breakaway of three riders included Vollering, who had bridged across to her teammate Chabbey and Santesteban over the final ascent. The trio pushed their lead out to 1:45 minutes over a chasing 12 riders in the closing 30km of the race, that only continued to increase as they descended toward the finale.</p>\n<p>A Visma-Lease a Bike quartet led the chase group having the most riders in the mix, but did not receive help from other teams Human Powered Health, Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto, VolkerWessels, Team Coop-Repsol and Eneicat-CMTeam.</p>\n<p>The trio continued to push their lead out to more than two minutes in the final 14km as Vollering and Chabbey set a blistering pace, and Santesteban sitting on their wheels with no obligation to assist her FDJ-SUEZ rivals.</p>\n<p>Chabbey made her winning move with 1.4km to go, forcing Santesteban to chase with Vollering on her wheel.</p>\n<p>The Swiss rider opened her gap to 10 seconds in the final few hundred metres, and crossed the finish line with the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17932&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17932&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A further six seconds down, Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) led home the next group on the road.</p>\n<p>After finishing ninth place among Wollaston&#8217;s chase group, Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) takes over the green jersey of race leader from stage 1 winner Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal). </p>\n<p>The American racer now leads Markus by four seconds, while Wollaston is in third overall at 12 seconds. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Today still hasn&#8217;t fully sunk in! It was a hard and aggressive race as soon as we hit the circuit, but we rode really well as a team, always together and in position for the key moments,&#8221; Roldan said after her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After yesterday&#8217;s disappointing mechanical and losing time on GC, I came into today super motivated, and so did the girls. We were fully committed to the plan. The team set me up perfectly going into the second lap, and I attacked on the steepest part of the climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As soon as I got a gap, I knew I had to commit and give it everything to the line. It was still a long way ‚Äì 15km ‚Äì but Callum in the car kept me motivated, and I dug deep all the way to the finish. I&#8217;m so thankful to all the girls for their hard work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a special feeling to take this win, especially as it&#8217;s my first in the Women&#8217;s WorldTour. It gives us so much confidence going forward, not just for the next two days of this race, but for the rest of the season!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in Hartlepool, the stage looped around Teesside before ending with almost two laps of a circuit around Saltburn-by-the-Sea that included the Marske Lane climb and the climb up Saltburn Bank, finishing about 400 metres after the top for a total of 114.3km.</p>\n<p>Green jersey Le Court went down in a crash only a few minutes into the race, but fortunately, she could get back on her bike and continue the race.</p>\n<p>After 5km, Tiffany Keep (DAS-Hutchinson) went on the attack, and when Madeleine Leech (Handsling Alba Development) and Lucy Gadd (Smurfit Westrock) bridged to her, the break of the day was established.</p>\n<p>Their advantage maxed out at just over three minutes before the peloton started the chase. At the intermediate sprint in Guisborough, where Keep sprinted for the points, the gap was down to 2:04 minutes.</p>\n<p>Keep kept on going after the sprint, and Gadd came back to her while Leech dropped back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Keep left Gadd behind on the way up Marske Lane and was first over the top, but the peloton was only 10 seconds down as Anouska Koster (Uno-X Mobility) just passed Gadd at the QOM sprint.</p>\n<p>With 30km to go, Keep&#8217;s breakaway was over. The peloton was down to about 60 riders, and Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek) tried to get away over the rolling hills. A crash in a wet corner took down Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) and split the peloton, with Le Court in the second group.</p>\n<p>Deignan led into Saltburn Bank with one lap to go until Faulkner took over with Cat Ferguson and Henderson on her wheel.</p>\n<p>Henderson attacked 150 metres from the finish line in a bid for the time bonuses but missed out as Faulkner, Ferguson, and Karlijn Swinkels passed her on the line. Le Court was in a group 53 seconds down, with Wiebes even further behind.</p>\n<p>Picnic PostNL took charge and pushed the pace in the lead group with five riders, setting up Roldan&#8217;s attack on Marske Lane, where the 21-year-old Canadian gained a 20-second gap on the 15 riders that remained together behind her.</p>\n<p>Markus jumped away from that group on one of the brief descents in the rolling last 13km and inched towards Roldan on her own, reducing the gap to only nine seconds at one point. But Roldan kept going and held Markus at around 10 seconds up until the flamme rouge, where the climb of Saltburn Bank began.</p>\n<p>The Canadian gave it her all, attacking the climb with an open mouth and fervently pushing the pedals while Markus had a steadier pace. At the top of the climb, Roldan was sure of the victory but never slowed down, only celebrating after crossing the finish line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek) followed Le Court‚Äôs acceleration, and Faulkner jumped across the gap as well.</p>\n<p>Le Court attacked again, dropping Henderson and Faulkner, and Faulkner left Henderson behind, about halfway up the climb. The Mauritian crossed the QOM line five seconds ahead of Faulkner, with what remained of the peloton at 27 seconds.</p>\n<p>Faulkner joined Le Court on the descent, and behind them a chase group of 20 riders formed that was led by FDJ-Suez, later joined by Movistar. However, they didn‚Äôt make inroads on the gap to the front duo, who were 30 seconds ahead at the intermediate sprint in Newton-under-Roseberry.</p>\n<p>Eight km from the finish, the gap was still 24 seconds, and as they reached the coastal road with 2.5km to go, Le Court and Faulkner could be confident they would sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>Although the sprinters came closer in the end, Le Court beat Faulkner in the sprint to win by five seconds ahead of the chase group that was led home by Wiebes. In addition to the green leader‚Äôs jersey, Le Court also scooped up the combativity award and the lead in the points and QOM classifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Lauren Dickson (Handsling Alba Development) was third overall, another five seconds back. </p>\n<p>The opening 12.9km let to the first of five ascents of the Grisbakken (300 metres at 9%), which was part of the 22-mile circuits around Stavanger for a total of 108 kilometres. A crash on the first lap separated the peloton into several groups, but the front two groups were back together for the second of the five circuits.</p>\n<p>AG Insurance-Soudal set the pace over the second pass of the category 3 climb and 73km to go, with race leader Ghekiere the first over the top.

Cyclists nationwide dream of wearing the stars and stripes jersey of the USA Cycling National Champion, a distinction that goes to only the very best of our sport. Professional men and women cyclists, will compete on the roads of downtown Charleston May 19 ‚Äì 26, 2025. Competitions will include the Individual Time Trial, Criterium, and Road race disciplines.</p>\n<p>Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) defended her title in the elite women&#8217;s road race at the USA Pro Road Championships in Charleston on Monday. </p>\n<p>The double Olympic champion won a three-way sprint to the line, beating runner-up Lauren Stephens (Aegis Cycling Foundation) and third-placed Katherine Sarkisov (CCB p/b Levine Law Group) on the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Going into the last two laps, I pushed the pace on the climbs and with one and half to go, we had to go, we had to play hardball. I knew we had to catch Emma [Langley]; she&#8217;s a strong athlete, we have been teammates before, she was national champion before, so I knew we had to catch her,&#8221; Faulkner said in a post-race interview.</p>\n<p>Outlining the tactics between the three breakaway riders in the closing kilometres, she said &#8220;I was worried that when we caught her, there would be counterattacks and the pace would be high, so thankfully Lauren and Katherine worked with me; very strong ride by both of them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew going into the end, it would be hard to attack because Lauren was covering my attacks all day, so I&#8217;ve never won from a sprint before, and said, &#8216;If there was ever a day to make it happen, we gotta make it happen today.&#8217; I&#8217;ve been working on my sprint all winter, and thankfully, it worked today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Faulkner made a decisive move on the Bridge Road ascent with 19km remaining in the race, Stephens followed, and the pair were later joined by Sarkisov over the top and on the flatter sections.</p>\n<p>They caught and passed solo breakaway rider and Stephens&#8217; Aegis Cycling Foundation teammate Emma Langley, who had been out front since attacking early in the race on the first of four large circuits, briefly joined by a bridger, Jamie Chapman (Speedblock p/b Terun). </p>\n<p>Only three riders entered the final together, and Stephens attacked on the last time up the Wertz climb, with Faulkner closing the distance. That effort briefly dispatched Sarkisov off the back, but after a monstrous effort, she regained contact on the descent and flatter sections with 3.8km from the line.</p>\n<p>Sarkisov then led the leaders into the final corners of the race, also starting her sprint first on the straightaway. But Stephens countered on the right side of the road with Faulkner pulling up alongside her and then sprinting to the line, ahead by a whisker to secure the stars-and-stripes for another year.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe elite women first competed on two laps of the 14.4km junior circuit featuring the Wertz climb, with pitches as steep as 24%.  They then crossed to the opposite side of the river to tackle the punishing Bridge Road climb for four large laps of a 20.9km combined junior-elite circuit, making a total of 113.8km.</p>\n<p>The peloton remained largely intact along the opening shorter circuits before crossing the Kanawaka River to start the longer circuits. Aegis Cycling Foundation&#8217;s Langley was the first rider to launch a solo attack on the field on the first time around the large loop, opening a gap of 40 seconds.</p>\n<p>Cynisca did the lion&#8217;s share of the work to manage the time gap, holding the time at 1:10, as they raced over the Wertz climb and toward the second of four larger loops.</p>\n<p>Although there were a couple of attacks out of the field, Langley&#8217;s teammate Katherine Sheridan shut down many of the moves until former rower Jamie Chapman (Speedblock p/b Terun) broke the elastic band and went on a solo chase in pursuit of Langley.</p>\n<p>Thanks to her powerful effort, Chapman made the connection to Langley with 35km (roughly two laps) remaining. Their gap, however, dropped to 35 seconds as the reduced field of 20 riders focused on the chase, led by Cynisca.</p>\n<p>Faulkner sat patiently in fourth wheel, biding her time while rival teams closed the gap, and said that her plan was to try and whittle the group down further on the final two laps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They took out half of the first two laps, so the course was easier this year. I was expecting more attacks off the front from kilometre zero, but we didn&#8217;t see that. I think some teams wanted to stay together and play their numbers in the end,&#8221; Faulkner said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The group was pretty big compared to last year, going into the final laps. I thought, &#8216;How do we shrink this?&#8217;, and so there were attacks in the final few laps. But I knew that if I wanted to make the race hard and whittle it down, I would have to push myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Out front, Langley attacked again and distanced Chapman on the Wertz climb, once again going solo into the last lap. Once over the top, however, Chapman dragged herself back up to Langley, pushing the pair&#8217;s gap out to 25 seconds on the flatter sections of the course.</p>\n<p>Chapman struggled to hang on to Langley over the Bridge climb with the Aegis Cycling Foundation rider going solo, again, over the top.</p>\n<p>As planned, Faulkner put pressure on the field over the Bridge climb, splitting the reduced peloton apart, and reeling in Chapman with 19km remaining. Stephens was the only rider who could follow Faukner&#8217;s pace, but offered no help in the chase to reach her teammate Langley.</p>\n<p>Faulkner and Stephens reached Langley with 18.2km to go, ending her solo breakaway, as the pair then launched themselves into the race for the stars-and-stripes jersey. In a surprising move, Sarkisov managed to make it across to the pair to form a late-race breakaway of three.</p>\n<p>Chasing 30 seconds behind the trio were Langley, Natalie Quinn (Cynisca), Aia Shafi (Fount Cycling Guild) and Ashley Frye (Phase 1 Cycling), along with Galen Bolard (Competitive Edge Racing). They nearly closed the gap before the finish line, finally crossing just eight seconds behind the day&#8217;s winner, Faulkner.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15298&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15298&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It‚Äôs sharp, 9km, and it was really interesting with the technical aspect. It was hard, so it was a really nice comeback on the individual time trial,‚Äù said Reusser after her first individual time trial in 20 months.</p>\n<p>With two stage victories and a second place, Reusser was dominant in the GC, winning the race overall by almost two minutes.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe came here with the idea that I could win the overall, but we couldn‚Äôt expect that it would be this clear, so of course we are super happy. I think I showed a nice shape, but the whole team did really great work,&#8221; Reusser said.</p>\n<p>Both in the race, but also today, I‚Äôm doing an individual time trial, but the preparation and support is a big team behind, they do a lot of things and do it so well, so I could really focus on my task.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 9.4km time trial from Villasana de Mena to Lezana de Mena was anything but straightforward, including several tight turns, narrow and bumpy roads, and about 100 altitude metres.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Koerner (Uno-X Mobility) was the first to set a benchmark with 13:24 minutes, and the 24-year-old Dane kept the hot seat until Zoe B√§ckstedt (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) took another 19 seconds off the clock to set the new best time.</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt settled in for a long wait as nobody came close to her 13:05 minutes until Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) finished two seconds faster, leapfrogging Mireia Benito (AG Insurance-Soudal) and S√©gol√®ne Thomas (St Michel-Preference Home) in GC to finish in 11th place overall.</p>\n<p>Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) added to her stage 2 victory by setting a new best time of 13:01 minutes, moving past Valentina Cavallar (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health) to finish seventh overall.</p>\n<p>Ottestad barely had time to get off her bike before her time was beaten, though, as Labous was the next rider on the road and broke the 13-minute mark to finish in 12:57 minutes. Longo Borghini came close but was two seconds slower, but Reusser beat Labous‚Äô time by six seconds to win the time trial in 12:51 minutes.</p>\n<p>In addition to the GC, Reusser also won the points and mountain jersey. Nienke Vinke, 16th overall, won the U23 jersey while Benito won the combativity prize and was the best Spanish rider.

The race is held in the autonomous region of Castile and Le√≥n in northern Spain, on flat and hilly stages.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) won a solo victory on stage 3 of the Vuelta a Burgos F√©minas that finished atop the 7.8km climb up the Pic√≥n Blanco, crossing the line 40 seconds ahead of Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) and 1:17 minutes ahead of Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Reusser had accelerated from the group of favourites on the steepest part of the climb with 4.4km to go, and only Kastelijn and Chabbey could stay with her. Chabbey had to let go a few hundred metres later, and Reusser kept pushing hard, finally cracking Kastelijn at the two-kilometre mark. Behind Reusser, riders finished in ones and twos after a challenging climb.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had so much time [after stage 2] that I actually did not need to attack. But then the pace was just not so hard, I put a bit harder pace, and then I was off. It was not exactly the plan; it just came out like this,‚Äù said Reusser after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe said, ‚Äòwe are not the leader of the GC, but we can probably go after the stage‚Äô, and we behaved like that. We really wanted to control the race and position ourselves well, and they did that until the final climb. Even then, Paula [Pati√±o] could still do a pace at the beginning of the climb. The team did an amazing job, also the DS, also the rest of the staff, I‚Äôm so happy with Movistar, thank you,‚Äù Reusser profusely thanked her team for setting up the victory.</p>\n<p>With her stage victory, she leads the general classification by 1:10 minutes over Kastelijn going into the stage 4 individual time trial.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNormally, I‚Äôm a good time triallist. It‚Äôs my first time trial for almost two years, so I almost don‚Äôt remember. No, I do remember, but I‚Äôm really curious to do a time trial again. We‚Äôll see,‚Äù Reusser looked ahead to the Sunday stage.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe stage covered only 95.7km from Soncillo to the Pic√≥n Blanco but included three third-category climbs along the way to the special-category finishing climb. Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Lauretta Hanson (Lidl-Trek) did not start the stage.</p>\n<p>After an early move was brought back, the peloton crossed the Ojo Guare√±a and Alto de la Retuerta climbs together before a breakaway of seven formed with 65km to go: Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly), Catalina Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), and Alicia Gonz√°lez (St Michel-Preference Home) were joined by Anastasiya Kolesava (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ), Annemarie Worst (Fenix-Deceuninck), and Siliva Zanardi (Human Powered Health).</p>\n<p>Their biggest advantage was 1:50 minutes with 36km to go, then Movistar put their riders to work in the chase, reducing the gap to under a minute. Three riders lost contact on the Alto de Bocos climb, leaving only Kolesava, Blasi, Jackson, and Soto in front at the top, 20km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>The last four escapees were caught with 11.7km to go, and Lidl-Trek and Movistar led the peloton into the finishing climb. Pati√±o set the early pace, reducing the peloton to 15 riders when she swung off with 6.6km to go.</p>\n<p>√âlise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) took over, reducing the group further to ten riders other than herself: Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility), Reusser, Kastelijn, Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime), Longo Borghini, Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health), Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), purple jersey Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility), and Valentina Cavallar (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels.</p>\n<p>Petra Stiasny (Roland) and S√©gol√®ne Thomas (St Michel-Preference Home) returned to the group from behind, but on the steepest part of the climb at over 11%, Reusser put in her acceleration that caused the group to explode and set up her solo victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is held in the autonomous region of Castile and Le√≥n in northern Spain, on flat and hilly stages.</p>\n<p>Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) took the biggest victory of her career so far when she won stage 2 of the Vuelta a Burgos F√©minas, outsprinting Marlen Reusser (Movistar) after the two had attacked over the top of the day&#8217;s only classified climb with 7km to go.</p>\n<p>Reusser and Ottestad worked together to keep the chasing peloton behind, and on the finishing straight, Ottestad came around Reusser to take the win in Roa de Duero. </p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won the sprint for third place 18 seconds later, but her teammate Lotte Kopecky was held up by a mass crash 30km from the line and finished 1:45 minutes down.</p>\n<p>Norwegian champion Ottestad is the new GC leader going into stage 3.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs my first WorldTour victory, so I‚Äôm really happy. I don‚Äôt really understand it yet. It was a hectic final, and to be able to go with Marlen and outsprint her was really cool,&#8221; said Ottestad.</p>\n<p>Originally, she was not the team‚Äôs protected rider for the day, but Ottestad grasped the opportunity when it presented itself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were going for a sprint today with Linda [Zanetti], but then the last climb was a bit harder than we expected,&#8221; recalled the Norwegian. &#8220;We also thought there would be some attacks. I was on it, we got a gap, and then it was just about holding on to the finish line.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 122km stage from Villalba de Duero to Roa de Duero was the flattest road stage of the race, with only one classified climb, the Alto de Cerca Peseta, cresting 7km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Andrea Alzate (Eneicat-CM) and Irene Cagnazzo (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni) attacked after 10km to form the break of the day, building an advantage of up to three minutes. They were reeled in with 31.5km to go.</p>\n<p>Less than two kilometres later, a mass crash took down almost twenty riders and held up many more. Although nobody looked badly hurt, the crash had a big influence on the stage anyway as it split the peloton in two, with world champion Kopecky the most prominent rider in the second group.</p>\n<p>UAE Team ADQ took charge in the first peloton, trying to force echelons on the finishing circuit, but the wind was not strong enough. </p>\n<p>However, this meant that the gap to the dropped riders became bigger and bigger, even though SD Worx-Protime called Femke Markus back to lead the chase together with Marie Schreiber, Barbara Guarischi, and Kopecky herself.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) attacked on the Alto de Cerca Peseta, and only Reusser could follow her move. √âlise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) jumped across the gap, but Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) brought Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), Silke Smulders (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), and the Uno-X Mobility duo of Ottestad and Katrine Aalerud back.</p>\n<p>Another group returned before the top of the climb, making it about 15 riders in front. Longo Borghini had just taken a turn and swung off when Reusser accelerated with Ottestad in her wheel, putting the group in single file and opening a gap. </p>\n<p>With Longo Borghini looking around for support, the moment to close down Reusser and Ottestad was gone.</p>\n<p>They increased their advantage to 21 seconds at the flamme rouge, and Reusser led them onto the slightly uphill finishing straight, trying to gain as much time in GC as possible. </p>\n<p>Ottestad started her sprint at the 100-metre mark and passed Reusser to win the stage and move into the overall lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Wiebes&#8217; teammate Lotte Kopecky had led out the sprint and held on for third place.</p>\n<p>After the early break had been caught with just under 40km to go, a strong group of 11 riders got away from the peloton and turned the stage into a GC fight over the Alto La Varga.</p>\n<p>The chasing group closed the gap after the descent, and C√©lia Gery (FDJ-Suez) and Steffi H√§berlin (SD Worx-Protime) went off the front 17.4km from the finish.

We had two cards to play in the final with Lotte Kopecky and me. When I saw Elisa Balsamo came over Lotte, I also started my sprint, and it worked out for the win,&#8221; said Wiebes after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew that the uphill part was steepest towards the last 300 meters. I followed Elisa Longo Borghini and took the outside corner. It was really tough towards the finish line, but I&#8217;m really proud of how I finished it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 125-kilometre stage from Burgos to Poza de la Sal included three third-category climbs, but this belied the profile of the stage, which had several more unclassified climbs and an uphill finish.</p>\n<p>Right after the start, Morgane Coston (Roland) and Idoia Eraso (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) broke away to form the break of the day. </p>\n<p>They enjoyed an advantage of 5:35 minutes on the Alto de la Ermita de las Mercedes, where Coston was first over the top. As she had also won the Alto de las Rebolledas mountain sprint, the Frenchwoman will wear the red mountain jersey on stage 2. </p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime in particular put their riders to work to reduce the gap, and on the descent from the unclassified Puerto de la Mazorra, Coston and Eraso were reeled in. </p>\n<p>A group of eleven riders counterattacked: Kopecky, Wiebes, Barbara Guarischi (all SD Worx-Protime), Gery, Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Aude Biannic (Movistar), Elisa Longo Borghini, Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ), Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado (Fenix-Deceuninck), Franziska Koch (Picnic PostNL), and Kathrin Schweinberger (Human Powered Health) went away. </p>\n<p>This split the peloton into several groups, with Movistar chasing hard in the second group, about 20 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>On the Alto de La Varga, Guarischi, Blasi, Alvarado, and Schweinberger had to let go, and Marlen Reusser (Movistar) bridged to the remaining seven frontrunners on her own. </p>\n<p>Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), Silke Smulders (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Edwards (Human Powered Health), Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), Katrine Aalerud, Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (both Uno-X Mobility), Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), and H√§berlin followed, making it a front group of 17.</p>\n<p>The following group made contact after the descent, though, to form a peloton of over 30 riders inside 19km to go. Mireia Benito (AG Insurance-Soudal) attacked right away, but it was the counterattack from Gery and H√§berlin that was let go.</p>\n<p>With nobody taking up the chase, Gery and H√§berlin increased their advantage to 54 seconds with 7.5km to go, but when another dropped group came back to the peloton and Lidl-Trek immediately put two riders to work at the front, the gap started to come down.</p>\n<p>More teams joined the chase as the front duo came into sight of the peloton, and Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ) closed the gap on the lower slopes of the finishing climb, 1300 metres from the line.</p>\n<p>Kopecky came to the front at the 500-metre mark, but Balsamo came off her wheel on the finishing straight, prompting Wiebes to sprint as well and take the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10428&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is usually held over a distance of 110‚Äì120 kilometres (68‚Äì75 miles).</p>\n<p>Isabella Holmgren (Lidl-Trek) celebrated her first professional road racing victory at the Durango-Durango Emakumeen Saria. </p>\n<p>The 19-year-old Canadian attacked over the final ascent with 10km remaining and held off lone chaser and runner-up √âvita Muzic (FDJ-SUEZ) as Thalita de Jong (Human Powered Health) won the reduced-group sprint for third on the day.</p>\n<p>Between top-tier stages races, Itzulia Women and Vuelta a Burgos, the peloton competed in the one-day 1.1 Durango Durango Emakumeen Saria on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The field lined up for a challenging 113km race in and around Durango, including four circuits with an intermediate sprint atop Alto de Miota. The race then routed into a larger loop in the last 40km that included three ascents; Arietio (4.3km at 4.2%), Alto de Goiuria (5km at 4.7%) and then a final climb over Alto de Goiuria but from a different direction that started with a steep 10% in the first 1km followed by 4.8km at 5.6% and a descent into the Durango finish line.</p>\n<p>The peloton remained largely intact through the opening short circuits with Eva Anguela (Cantabria Deporte-Rio Miera) and Catalina Anais Soto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) securing the first of the intermediate sprints, respectively.</p>\n<p>However, a decisive attack came from Elena Hartmann (Ceratizit Pro Cycling) at the 30km mark, with the Swiss rider pushing her lead to over a minute on the chasing field.</p>\n<p>Hartmann picked up the remaining intermediate sprint points over the last two laps of the shorter circuit, securing the special classification jersey, before she was swept up by the peloton with 30km to go.</p>\n<p>The field split apart over the three ascents inside the final 30km of the race, with the first significant attack coming from Holmgren with 10km to go over the final climb of the Alto de Goiuria.</p>\n<p>Chasing the solo Canadian on the upper slopes were √âvita Muzic (FDJ-SUEZ) and Ane Santesteban (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), but the pair never regained contact.</p>\n<p>Holmgren crested over the top and sped down the descent on the other side, sweeping along the wide open turns with a slim 14-second gap in the final 2km. That was all she needed to claim her first road victory since turning pro with Lidl-Trek in 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9600&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9600&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race takes place in the Basque Country autonomous community in Northern Spain, on tough, hilly roads similar to the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) has won the Itzulia Women with a solo victory on the final stage around Donostia. The 2022 and 2024 winner attacked on the Mendizorrotz climb and soloed to the finish to win the stage, 55 seconds ahead of Sarah van Dam (Ceratizit) and Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal)</p>\n<p>Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) was the last rider to be dropped by Vollering but was caught on the run-in to Donostia, and on the final kilometre, Van Dam and Ghekiere attacked in a bid for the GC podium. Van Dam beat Ghekiere in the sprint for second and took third place overall, while Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) held on to second place in GC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I needed to get some time on Mischa, so I could not wait. And when there is a climb, I know how strong I am. Even though I crashed yesterday, so I had a lot of muscle pain and stiff body, but I have done worse, with a broken back in the Tour de France, so I know I can do it and just really need to trust myself and full-gas go for it,&#8221; said Vollering after her solo arrival.</p>\n<p>It was Vollering‚Äôs seventh Itzulia stage victory in four editions, but the first with her new team FDJ-Suez, and she thanked her teammates for their support.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My team was so strong today. Amber [Kraak] was riding in front the whole day, and L√©a [Curinier] did a really, really strong pull on the first part of the climb to make it as hard as possible from the bottom, √âvita [Muzic], perfect job to follow the second group, so it was perfect teamwork today,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><strong>How It Unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing in Donostia (San Sebasti√°n), the 112.6km stage with the climbs of Jaizkibel, Gurutze, and Mendizorrotz was always going to be the day to decide the overall victory.</p>\n<p>Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) and Liane Lippert (Movistar), second overall after stage 2, did not start the final stage. Despite numerous attempts, nobody managed to establish a breakaway in the first hour of the race. A group of 20 riders got a gap but were caught again before the Jaizkibel climb started.</p>\n<p>Ava Holmgren (Lidl-Trek) got away on the climb but was soon caught, and her teammate Amanda Spratt led the peloton over the top ahead of Vollering. On the Gurutze climb, Sara Mart√≠n (Movistar) and C√©lia Le Mouel (Ceratizit) got away, building a gap of almost two minutes.</p>\n<p>Behind the front duo, Bredewold beat Vollering to the remaining bonus second at the intermediate sprint in Usurbil, 25.5km from the finish. By this point, the peloton, led by FDJ-Suez, had reduced the gap to under a minute. Mart√≠n and Le Mouel were reeled in with 17.2km to go, shortly before the start of the Mendizorrotz climb.</p>\n<p>Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) made an acceleration right away that only Vollering and Niedermaier could follow immediately, but Bredewold and Muzic bridged the gap quickly. When Vollering attacked again, only Garc√≠a and Niedermaier could hold her wheel, though, and another acceleration by Vollering on the steepest part of the climb led to Garc√≠a losing contact. Eventually, Niedermaier had to let go as well, and Vollering had four kilometres of climbing left to make the difference.</p>\n<p>At the top of the climb, exactly ten kilometres from the finish, she was 46 seconds ahead of Niedermaier and 1:13 minutes ahead of a group of about a dozen riders led by Bredewold. Vollering kept her advantage on the descent and could celebrate on the finish line while Niedermaier was caught by the group behind.</p>\n<p>Ghekiere launched an attack at the flamme rouge, but Van Dam dug deep to reach her with 150 metres to go. The Canadian won the sprint for second place, and the time bonification put her on the overall podium. In addition to the overall win, Vollering also took home the mountain jersey while Bredewold kept the points jersey, and Niedermaier won the U23 classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Liane Lippert (Movistar) finished second while Soraya Paladin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) took third place.</p>\n<p>The final was an edge-of-the-seat affair as a late breakaway of Silke Smulders (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Mareille Meijering (Movistar), and Rosita Reijnhout (Visma-Lease a Bike) almost held off the peloton, only being caught 200 metres from the finish.</p>\n<p>With her stage victory, Bredewold keeps the yellow jersey going into the final stage on Sunday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI still feel I‚Äôm a little bit in a different world because, woah, it was a very hard stage, very hard sprint. I can only say thank you to my team, Miki [Mikayla Harvey] and Steffi [H√§berlin] today, of course Marie [Schreiber] and Marta [Lach] in the beginning, I am speechless, actually. They did such an incredible job. I owe everything to them,‚Äù said the stage winner.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime were down one rider as Anna van der Breggen chose not to start stage 2 after her crash in the final of stage 1.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs not nice for [Anna] herself to crash out like this, and secondly, for the team, it‚Äôs not nice, she is such a strong, class rider that you‚Äôre definitely missing her on stages like this,&#8221; Bredewold said of the stage. &#8220;Steffi and I both had a hard time on the second climb, yesterday felt a bit better than today, to be honest, but luckily we came back, and then it was just full gas, working, jumping, all the time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With two stage victories under her belt ‚Äì just like in 2024 ‚Äì Bredewold is looking forward to stage 3 but acknowledged that it would be a challenge to win that one as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs definitely going to be the hardest stage. I mean, obviously we are going to try, that‚Äôs not a secret, but it will be very, very hard. There are a few girls who are going incredibly strong on the climbs, so I‚Äôm going to need an extremely good day tomorrow to have a chance, so we‚Äôll see. It will be up to fate, I guess,&#8221; she finished.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 116km stage started in Ugao-Miraballes and included four classified climbs plus several other uncategorised ascents, but the final 20km to the finish in Igorre, the centre of Basque cyclo-cross.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) launched an attack on the second climb of the day to Lamindao, cresting the climb at the front of a small group that also included Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck), Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>More riders came back on the descent, forming a front group of around 25 riders that also included Bredewold. Vollering was dropped from the group with a puncture but quickly came back after a bike change, and eventually the group grew further to a peloton of 60 riders.</p>\n<p>About 50km from the finish, Julie Van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) went on a solo breakaway. Marta Jaskulska (Ceratizit) tried to bridge to the Belgian, but never made it across and was caught again on the day‚Äôs last classified climb to Arrieta. Van de Velde won the Gerekiz and Arrieta mountain sprints but fell one point short of taking over the polka-dot jersey which remains on the shoulders of Morgane Coston (Roland).</p>\n<p>Going into the last 30km, Van de Velde was only 30 seconds ahead of the peloton, prompting first Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) and then Mijntje Geurts (Visma-Lease a Bike) to bridge across. When Smulders and Paula Pati√±o (Movistar) also jumped across the gap with 14km to go, quickly followed by Spratt, it fell to Bredewold herself to neutralise the move.</p>\n<p>Smulders attacked again right away, getting a small gap, and Meijering and Reijnhout went after her, reaching the front 11.5km from the finish. </p>\n<p>The three riders‚Äô advantage was never bigger than 20 seconds, but they held a small gap all the way to the final kilometre. There, Reijnhout took the lead but sat up when Meijering made a last all-or-nothing acceleration into the roundabout with 600 metres to go. </p>\n<p>The peloton was close behind, though, and when Bredewold reached Meijering and Smulders at the 200-metre mark, the breakaway was over, and the GC leader sprinted to another stage win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14244&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race takes place in the Basque Country autonomous community in Northern Spain, on tough, hilly roads similar to the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n.</p>\n<p>Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) won the opening stage of the Itzulia Women, continuing the team&#8217;s incredible dominance of the Basque race. </p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime have now won consecutive stages since Itzulia Women was created in 2022. However, it was a day of contrasting emotions, as team leader Anna van der Breggen crashed with eight kilometres to go and lost 43 seconds.   </p>\n<p>21-year-old British rider Millie Couzens (Fenix-Deceuninck) was second in the sprint ahead of Margaux Vigi√© (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>Bredewold has now won three races in 2025, including the recent Amstel Gold Race. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard day, and that suits me really well,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;The team had a lot of confidence in me, which made me feel really good but also really nervous.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They were pulling full gas for me for the last hour. I just tried to stay as calm as possible,&#8221; Bredewold said after celebrating with her teammates.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;We had to adjust in the final 500m because Msrta Lach, who was doing my lead out, got boxed in. Our little climber Steffi did a perfect lead out. This one is definitely for the team.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Bredewold was not aware of van der Breggen&#8217;s crash, saying, &#8220;I only heard about it after the finish, that&#8217;s not nice, and I hope she&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe opening 148.5km stage from Zumarraga to Agurain was a hilly first day in the Basque hills. </p>\n<p>After a steady roll out, Gaia Segato (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni), Katia Ragusa (Human Powered Health) and Morgane Coston (Roland) attacked, with Coston first to the QOM sprint in Arlaban after 42.8km.</p>\n<p>Sadly, Britain&#8217;s Claire Steels (Movistar) crashed after 50km and was forced to abandon the race. </p>\n<p>After the Opakua climb, with 50km to go, the race came back together, but soon Julie Van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Eva van Agt (Visma-Lease a Bike) went on the attack. However, SD Worx-Protime continued to control the gap at the head of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Following the Az√°zeta climb, the gap was just 27 seconds, as Marie Schreiber did the work for SD Worx-Protime.

First held in 2019, the race joined the UCI Women&#8217;s ProSeries in 2023. The race route usually involves sharp, steep climbs in and around Pamplona, with a steep finish into the city.</p>\n<p>Great Britain&#8217;s Cat Ferguson (Movistar) claimed her maiden victory in her first year as a professional at Navarra Women&#8217;s Elite Classics, outsprinting a reduced group in rain-soaked Pamplona to take a big win.</p>\n<p>After an attacking finale where several riders tried to get away but couldn&#8217;t make anything stick, the race came down to a group sprint with several cold and wet riders battling it out for the line. It was the 19-year-old Brit who proved the fastest, taking the win by a fair margin.</p>\n<p>Soraya Paladin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) finished fast to take second, whilst Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health) claimed third.</p>\n<p>The northern Spanish race was packed with climbs, and made harder by the rain and hail that began to fall in the middle of the afternoon, but despite various attempts to make it hard over the route&#8217;s nine climbs, a group of over 25 riders made it to the finish in Pamplona for a sprint.</p>\n<p>This was Ferguson&#8217;s first win as a senior professional rider after taking two wins at the end of last year as a junior stagiaire for Movistar, and her first victory of the season after a podium finish in Trofeo Alfredo Binda in March.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe race started in Pamplona, with nine punchy climbs 134km of racing across Navarra in store for the riders before a slightly uphill finish back in Pamplona.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the race, there were plenty of attacks, but generally the high pace in the peloton up the short but steep climbs stopped anyone from getting away properly. There was no real break for the first 70km, though the peloton was slowly being whittled down.</p>\n<p>On the Muro de Artajona, a 900m ramp through narrow city streets with a gradient of 9.6% with 58km to go, an injection of pace threatened to split up the peloton, and there was a brief fracturing, but things came back together on the flat.</p>\n<p>A lull in the peloton after this allowed the day&#8217;s first real escape to get away, as Eukene Larrarte (Massi-Baix Ter) and Nicole Steinmetz (Eneicat-CMTeam) went clear from the bunch. They were away from some 25km, as rain and hail started to fall, but were caught with 28km to go, on the 9km climb to Tirapu.</p>\n<p>Liv AlUla Jayco started to up the pace on the climb with Ana Trevisi and Monica Trinca Colonel, which strung up the bunch over the top of the climb, but a larger group reformed on the flat.</p>\n<p>On the next climb, with 16km to go, Trinca Colonel attacked over the top, joined by Paula Pati√±o (Movistar) and Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), but again they were soon brought back by the main group led by Lidl-Trek and UAE Team ADQ.</p>\n<p>The attacks continued in the last 13km ‚Äì as did the rain ‚Äì but no one could make a move stick, meaning a big group came into Pamplona to contest the sprint. There were no organised lead-outs to speak of and it was a big fight to the line, but despite opening up early, no one could come round the prodigious Ferguson and she had time to sit up and celebrate over the finish line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12195&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12195&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Noyelle-Ieper, in FrenchGrand Prix Andr√© Noyelle) is a Belgian cycling race created in 1983 that takes place in March, as a prelude to the Ghent-Wevelgem classic. Two events are organized and involve only junior runners (17/18 years old). The men&#8217;s event is part of the Junior Nations Cup from 2016 to 2022, while the women&#8217;s event is integrated into the Junior Women&#8217;s Nations Cup over the same period. Since the 1996 edition, the event has been named after former Belgian runner Andr√© Noyelle, in tribute to him.</p>\n<p>Erin Boothman has added the Women U19 Gent-Wevelgem to her list of achievements. The powerful British rider stayed alert in the final kilometer and sprinted to a commanding victory. Arens and Koops secured the second and third spots on the podium.</p>\n<p>The Women U19 began their Gent-Wevelgem In Flanders Fields at 10:00. The weather was favorable for the riders during their 71.3 km journey. The first hour of racing was calm, with a compact peloton and no early breakaways. A minor crash in Ypres caused a brief disturbance but had no major consequences.</p>\n<p>As expected, the Kemmelberg played the role of decisive factor. Top favorites Boothman and Arens proved to be the strongest, breaking away from the peloton. Behind them, the peloton fractured significantly. A group of about ten riders formed at the top of the Kemmelberg and began the chase after the two leaders.</p>\n<p>At the front, Boothman and Arens matched each other‚Äôs pace. Greek rider Stampori launched an attack from the chasing group in an attempt to bridge the gap. With 10 km to go, Stampori was still holding strong, getting within around 15 seconds of the leaders, but couldn‚Äôt close the gap.</p>\n<p>With 3 km remaining, Stampori‚Äôs bid seemed over as Koops joined her in the fight for third place. Arens attempted a late attack to surprise Boothman, but the British rider proved too strong and powered to the win. Koops claimed the final podium spot.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9394&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9394&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is organised by Unipublic and Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), which also organises the men&#8217;s Vuelta a Espa√±a. It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) took the first victory of her comeback by winning stage 4 of La Vuelta Femenina. The former World Champion attacked on the descent from the Puerto de El Buste, 7km from the finish line, and held off the chasing group for a solo victory.</p>\n<p>Twelve seconds later, Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) beat Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) to second place in the sprint of a group of 18 riders. Red jersey Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) finished seventh and keeps the overall lead due to bonus seconds picked up at the intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI did not expect this at all. It was not the plan, but we were with a small group in the downhill, and at that point, I was alone. The speed went out, and I saw a good moment, so I went. I did not expect to arrive solo, but it feels really nice,‚Äù said Van der Breggen after the finish.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe knew it could be a hard last climb. We wanted to be there with Mischa [Bredewold], Gerri [Femke Gerritse] and me, but in the end it was a really small group. The strategy was actually to try with Gerri again,‚Äù Van der Breggen explained.</p>\n<p>Going into the first mountain stage, Gerritse retains the GC lead, now five seconds over Van der Breggen and 11 seconds ahead of Vos. Van der Breggen is now the best-placed GC contender, 17 seconds ahead of fourth-placed Vollering.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going really well, but tomorrow will be honest. The speed on the climb was hard, and you saw how small the group was, so it‚Äôs going to be fighting. But this is in the pocket, so we had some really good days to start with,‚Äù said Van der Breggen.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 111.6km stage from Pedrola to Borja included two classified climbs, the second-category Alto del Moncayo and the third-category Puerto de El Buste, which crested just 11.6km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>There were many attempts to establish a breakaway, but none of the moves lasted for more than a few kilometres, and the peloton started the Alto del Moncayo climb together.</p>\n<p>The climb was tackled at a steady but not too hard pace until Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) attacked just under two kilometres from the top. The Italian climber was caught by Maud Oudeman (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek) a kilometre later, and the peloton reeled them all in soon after.</p>\n<p>With the QOM in sight, Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal) went for the mountain points and took the virtual lead in the mountain classification while √âvita Muzic (FDJ-Suez) led the peloton across the top.</p>\n<p>After the descent, teams prepared for the intermediate sprint in Novallas. SD Worx-Protime led out Gerritse, and Vollering latched onto her former teammates. Visma-Lease a Bike tried to lead out Vos but fell behind, and Vos had to sprint across to Bredewold, Gerritse, and Vollering before trying to go for the line. Gerritse won the sprint and six bonus seconds ahead of Vollering and Vos.</p>\n<p>On the five-kilometre Puerto de El Buste, Valentina Cavallar (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) was the first to make a move, taking Muzic and Mareille Meijering (Movistar) along with her. After Magnaldi bridged the gap to the front trio, Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) closed the move down halfway up the climb, and Movistar then controlled the pace in a peloton that still counted 30 to 40 riders.</p>\n<p>Meijering attacked again 1.5km from the top, but Muzic and Vollering were on her wheel immediately and did not let her get away. Only when Liane Lippert (Movistar) launched an attack 600 metres from the top of the climb did the peloton explode. Muzic led a group of about 15 riders across the QOM sprint to take the lead in the mountain classification; she will wear the polka-dot jersey on stage 5.</p>\n<p>Vollering and her teammate Juliette Labous both tried to get away on the false flat before the descent but could not get a gap. Instead, C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) used her trademark descending skills to attack at the 10km mark and eke out a small advantage. Vollering bridged across the gap with 8km to go, and the rest of the group returned as well.</p>\n<p>Gerritse was still in a chasing group about 15 seconds behind, so Van der Breggen then took the opportunity to attack herself, opening a gap on the winding roads. Through the technical last kilometre in Borja, Van der Breggen increased her advantage to 12 seconds and could celebrate the first victory in her comeback campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is organised by Unipublic and Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), which also organises the men&#8217;s Vuelta a Espa√±a. It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) took the first victory of her 2025 season by winning stage 2 of La Vuelta Femenina in an uphill sprint in Sant Boi de Llobregat.</p>\n<p>The 37-year-old veteran was first through the final corner with 150 metres to go and sprinted away to cross the line ahead of Letizia Paternoster (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) and Letizia Borghesi (EF Education-Oatly).</p>\n<p>Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) lost contact with the leading group and slipped out of the race lead.

Yes, it was slippery, but being in the front is then the best position,&#8221; Vos described the technical finish with several roundabouts and corners.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 99-kilometre stage from Molins de Rei to Sant Boi de Llobregat took in the Catalonian hinterland west of Barcelona. It started with the 10km climb of the Alt de La Creu de L&#8217;Aragall where Ane Santesteban (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) initiated an attack and was first over the top to take the mountain points and move into the polka-dot jersey.</p>\n<p>After Santesteban was caught on the descent, Elena Cecchini (SD Worx-Protime) went on the move, holding a lead of up to 50 seconds before she was reeled in again 64km from the finish. Since there were no successful breakaway attempts later in the race, though, Cecchini was awarded the white combativity jersey after the stage.</p>\n<p>It started to rain, and Anastasiya Kolesava (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Vittoria Guazzini (FDJ-Suez) went down in a descent. Both could continue, but their crash led to a group of five riders led by Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) getting a small gap on the rest of the race, holding this for a few kilometres.</p>\n<p>When they were caught, Ariana Albert (Eneicat-CM) and Lea-Lin Teutenberg (Lotto) tried unsuccessfully to get away. In heavy rain, the peloton contested the intermediate sprint in Vilafranca del Pened√®s where Vos was first to take six bonus seconds ahead of Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) who received two bonus seconds and C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) with two bonus seconds. This put Gerritse into the virtual race lead as she had started the stage three seconds down on Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Even though the rain stopped again, the wet roads still caused crashes. Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) was the most prominent victim, crashing in a roundabout just before the descent towards the finish started. Bradbury would finish 2:11 minutes behind, losing valuable time for her GC bid.</p>\n<p>In the plain after the descent, Bradbury&#8217;s teammate Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney made an attack but was soon brought back, and the sprint trains took over. They negotiated ten roundabouts in the last six kilometres without incident, and Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Wolff dropped off Vos at the front of the peloton going into the final left-hand turn 150 metres from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Vos sprinted out of the corner followed by Borghesi and Paternoster, but in fifth position, the bike Cat Ferguson (Movistar) slid out on wet paint, causing her to crash, also holding up Gerritse and Megan Jastrab (Picnic PostNL).</p>\n<p>Vos had opened up a gap of several bike lengths and could sit up to celebrate her victory. On the final metres, Paternoster came out of Borghesi&#8217;s slipstream, timing her sprint perfectly to take second place and the red jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is organised by Unipublic and Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), which also organises the men&#8217;s Vuelta a Espa√±a. It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek repeated their 2024 success by winning the opening team time trial of La Vuelta Femenina. The team covered the 8.1km through the streets of Barcelona in 9:30 minutes, beating SD Worx-Protime and Liv-AlUla-Jayco by three seconds.</p>\n<p>Defending champion Demi Vollering&#8217;s FDJ-SUEZ team finished fourth on the day, losing six seconds, after the team lost Vittoria Guazzini to a crash around the U-turn on the course.</p>\n<p>Ellen van Dijk led the Lidl-Trek team across the finish line and will wear the red leader&#8217;s jersey on stage 2. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe are super happy.

To do it in the end is super nice,‚Äù said Van Dijk after their victory was confirmed.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt went super fast. Before you know it, you finish. We had a good strategy and executed it really well. I think we did almost everything the way we wanted, so we were satisfied with the performance. And in the end, of course, it‚Äôs just waiting, waiting, waiting until the other teams finish. And then when you hear you won, it‚Äôs such a relief. These are the best wins because you can celebrate it all together.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe team time trial was held in the Eixample quarter of Barcelona with its long, straight boulevards. Starting and finishing on the Passeig de Gr√†cia, most of the course was out-and-back on the Avinguda Diagonal, with an intermediate time taking at the U-turn after 4.1km.</p>\n<p>Lotto were the first team off the start ramp and set the first time when they finished in 10:07 minutes. Cofidis went five seconds faster at the turning point and set a new best time in 9:57 minutes, the first team to break the ten-minute mark.</p>\n<p>The first Women‚Äôs WorldTeam to start, Picnic PostNL, blitzed around the course, taking nine seconds off Cofidis at the halfway point and setting a real benchmark with 9:39 minutes at the finish, putting the team in the hotseats to wait if anybody could beat their time.</p>\n<p>However, the next batch of teams all fell well short, with Movistar the closest contender as they finished seven seconds slower despite losing Cat Ferguson to a mechanical. When Liv-AlUla-Jayco reached the turning point, they stopped the clock at 4:58 minutes, promising a very fast time ‚Äì and at the finish, the purple-clad team took the lead with 9:33 minutes.</p>\n<p>Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto had been within a second of Liv-AlUla-Jayco at the turning point but finished five seconds slower. Lidl-Trek were also a second behind the leaders at the intermediate time but increased their speed on the way home, taking the lead with 9:30 minutes. </p>\n<p>UAE Team ADQ then finished off the pace in 10:00 minutes, leaving only SD Worx-Protime and FDJ-Suez out on the course. SD Worx-Protime were five seconds slower at the turning point but recovered to finish only three seconds down. </p>\n<p>FDJ-Suez were two seconds slower than Lidl-Trek at the intermediate time, but lost Guazzini through the U-turn as her front wheel locked up. The Italian could finish the stage, but without her time trialling skills, the team finished in 9:36 minutes, handing the victory to Lidl-Trek.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9058&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

There were three non-starters, Debora Silvestri (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), Julie Vlyminck (DD Grou) and Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>There was one group of five riders that tried to make an early breakaway, but they were caught just a few minutes after forming.</p>\n<p>A nasty crash early on saw both Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ) and Liane Lippert (Movistar) come down, with the former being forced to abandon a few moments later, just after the first of 10 classified climbs, the C√¥te de Saint-Roch.</p>\n<p>Three riders got a gap on the peloton with just under 130km to go they were Tiril J√∏rgensen (Coop-Repsol), Constance Valentin (Winspace-Orange-Seal) and Victoire Guilman (Cofidis), with Laura Molenaar (VolkerWessels) going for a bridge. They quickly got over a minute. </p>\n<p>Another counter move went away with Solbj√∏rk Minke Anderson (Uno-X Mobility), Fariba Hashimi (Ceratizit), Sylvie Swinkels (Roland) and Danielle De Francesco (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) getting a gap. All three groups came together with 112km to go, forming an eight-rider group which held a maximum gap of four minutes. </p>\n<p>The breakaway was dragged back after it lost cohesion with just over 70km to go, with FDJ-Suez controlling the peloton for their leader, Demi Vollering. </p>\n<p>More moves came and went, Maeva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) was one of the riders who did get away with 50km to go. She pulled out over a minute on the bunch. As the gap began to close, Valentina Cavallar (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) launched a counter move to try and bridge. </p>\n<p>Both were caught just before and during the infamous C√¥te de la Redoute with a major shock with Italian champion, Elisa Longo-Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), getting dropped on the climb. </p>\n<p>A group of 15 riders went clear on the C√¥te de la Redoute. The big favourites didn&#8217;t commit to any attacks with just over 30km to go, and multiple riders rejoined. </p>\n<p>Pauliena Rooijakkers (Fenix-Deceuninck) launched a move on the flat after the descent and got a small gap with Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto) and Kerbaol joining the Dutch climber at the front of the race. </p>\n<p>FDJ-Suez did set a good tempo in the chase, but then Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease A Bike) tried a move which was marked. Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) pushed hard and started working hard to bring the leaders back.</p>\n<p>Up front, Kerbaol launched on a small descent, using her amazing technical ability. However, Niedermaier was quick to drag her back to reform the group of four. They had over 20 seconds with 20km to go. </p>\n<p>Movistar went all out to try and bring the leaders back before the final climb of the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons. Van der Breggen and Kerbaol held on for the longes but Rooijakkers dropped back to bring her teammate, Puck Pieterse up to the front along with Kopecky and Vollering.</p>\n<p>Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto), Marlen Reusser (Movistar) and the rest all left behind. </p>\n<p>Vollering used the steepest gradients to try and drop Kopecky. However, the world champion held on along with Pieterse and Kerbaol. Despite the infernal pace by Vollering, Kopecky managed to hold on over the top of the Roche-aux-Faucons with a gap of about 10&#8243; over the closest chaser, Reusser. </p>\n<p>Once again, using the descent, Kerbaol went clear with 12km to go as the other three riders looked at each other, and Reusser joined the chase. </p>\n<p>Just before a large chasing group joined the group of Vollering, Pieters, Kopecky and Reusser, the winner of Fleche Wallonne, Pieterse, launched. However, Le Court rejoined the main group with Kopecky and Reusser both getting dropped. </p>\n<p>Kerboal was dragged back by Vollering, Pieterse and Le Court with just over 8km to go. The French rider then sat on the back with the chasing group just around 30 seconds down. </p>\n<p>No one wanted to go early, and it all came down to a sprint with Vollering leading out. Le Court came flying off her wheel, and the extremely powerful Mauritian rider was too fast for Pieterse, with Kerbaol missing out on the podium. </p>\n<p>Kopecky led the chasing pack home 24 seconds back on the leading group in Liege. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9052&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9052&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Held in mid-April on the same day as the men&#8217;s event, the race starts in Maastricht and finishes in Berg en Terblijt, Valkenburg. It features 21 categorized climbs, including four ascents of the Cauberg. The race is run entirely within the boundaries of Dutch Limburg, starting in the city of Maastricht and finishing in Berg en Terblijt, 1.8 kilometres from the top of the Cauberg.</p>\n<p>Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) won the Amstel Gold Race Women, soloing to the finish just seven seconds ahead of a group of four, where Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) came around Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) in the final metres to take the runner-up spot.</p>\n<p>They had all been part of a 23-rider breakaway that formed at the start of the antepenultimate lap, following the second ascent of the Cauberg. </p>\n<p>On the final lap, Pieterse forced a selection on the Geulhemmerberg that eventually led to a front group of five, also including Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) and Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Van Dijk attacked inside 6km to go, Bredewold jumped across, and the other three couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t close the gap. </p>\n<p>After a high-speed descent into Valkenburg, Bredewold left Van Dijk behind on the Cauberg and held off the chasers both on the climb and the 2km run-in to the finish to take the biggest victory of her career so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a rough week mentally, the team really pulled me through. Topsport is not easy. You put so much time and effort and emotion into it, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt fall in the right place. It almost doesn‚Äôt feel fair, and it doesn‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs hard to win a race. You need a team, and that‚Äôs what helped me win today,&#8221; said an emotional Bredewold after the race, before recounting how the race played out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is how we race as a team. We can always attack, seize the opportunity, and this was perfect. In this breakaway, I was struggling so much. And then we did this little descent, I love that descent, we had a gap, and Puck and Juliette went. </p>\n<p>&#8220;For some reason, I could not follow them, but I could stay really close, and Ellen [van Dijk] was the perfect companion. I said to her &#8216;come on, we need to do it together, for sure they cannot pace harder than we can if we do it together.&#8217; I‚Äôm also happy she committed fully.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After chasing onto three lead trio, Van Dijk was instrumental to Bredewold‚Äôs victory in another way, spurring the 24-year-old into action with her attack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm glad she did [attack]. I was maybe too scared to attack. I thought I would gamble on my sprint, maybe I can follow them this time. Ellen went and I thought they would jump, [but] they didn‚Äôt. And then I thought &#8216;it‚Äôs up to me.&#8217; Danny [Stam], behind me in the car, was saying &#8216;now it‚Äôs all or nothing, just full gas together.&#8217; I hated this Cauberg, but I thought I just keep going and don‚Äôt look at the powermeter, just go,&#8221; Bredewold said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This victory means so much. This is Amstel, it‚Äôs such a big race, and it‚Äôs in Holland. It‚Äôs just a fucking dream, honestly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nAn early breakaway of nine riders was reeled in before the first passage of the finish line with 73.4km to go of the 157.3km race, and Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) had to chase back after a crash.</p>\n<p>On the lap of the finishing circuit that followed, Anna van der Breggen led the SD Worx-Protime team in splitting the peloton with a blistering pace.</p>\n<p>Attacks on the Cauberg and the plateau afterwards led to a front group of 23 riders that consisted of Marion Bunel, Femke de Vries (both Visma-Lease a Bike), Blanka Vas, Bredewold, Lorena Wiebes (all SD Worx-Protime), Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility), Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Labous, Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez), Pieterse, Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), Anna Henderson, Van Dijk (both Lidl-Trek), Quinty Ton (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Mareille Meijering, Paula Pati√±o (Movistar), Mara Roldan, Megan Jastrab (Picnic-PostNL), Brodie Chapman, Persico (UAE Team ADQ), Eline Jansen (VolkerWessels), and Alison Jackson (EF Education-Oatly).</p>\n<p>As the break pulled away, Jade Wiel (FDJ-Suez), Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), and Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) formed a chase trio in an attempt to bridge to the front, but they were absorbed by the peloton with 30km to go. Van der Breggen, meanwhile, had abandoned the race after her earlier work.</p>\n<p>By that point, the front group was 1:30 ahead, and when they climbed the Cauberg near the end of the penultimate lap, the attacks began. Labous was the first to make a move, then Pieterse countered, but things came back together on the plateau. </p>\n<p>Further behind, Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) increased the pace as well, but as the peloton was 1:38 minutes behind entering the final lap, the victory was out of reach for most of the pre-race favourites.</p>\n<p>Pieterse and Labous attacked again on the Geulhemmerberg to split the group for good. Persico, Van Dijk, and Bredewold managed to limit the gap, and Persico left the other two behind on the upper part of the climb to start a solo chase, bridging the gap with 16.8km to go. </p>\n<p>Van Dijk and Bredewold returned with 12.3km to go and with only the relatively easy Bemelerberg and the final ascent of the Cauberg to come. </p>\n<p>After Bredewold responded to Van Dijk‚Äôs attack 5.6km from the finish, the two riders worked together until early on the Cauberg, where Bredewold left Van Dijk behind. </p>\n<p>In the group behind, Labous dropped Pieterse and Persico, picking up Van Dijk close to the top of the climb. Pieterse came back just after the climb and immediately accelerated past the other two, but could not get a gap. </p>\n<p>Labous and Pieterse led the chase with Van Dijk sitting on, but Bredewold was still four seconds ahead going into the final kilometre and held on to win. </p>\n<p>Persico returned with 500 metres to go but had nothing left for the sprint that was opened by Pieterse. On the final metres, though, Van Dijk came from behind with speed to finish second.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9050&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9050&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is considered transitionary, positioned between the flatter cobbled classics and the steeper Ardennes classics races. The course features the cobbled Moskesstraat [nl] climb (550 metres in length, average gradient of 7.98% with a maximum gradient of 18%)</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) took a second consecutive victory at De Brabantse Pijl Dames, confirming she has recovered from the concussion she suffered during the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<p>The Italian National Champion rode an aggressive race and attacked alone on the Moskesstraat climb with 11km to race. She opened a 25-second gap and the chasers failed to close the gap on the successive Holstheide climb and the rise to the finish line. </p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) won the sprint for second place as Longo Borghini celebrated victory with two fingers in the air. Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) was third, with 14 riders in the case group that finished six seconds down.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini crashed hard during the Tour of Flanders and was forced to spend a night in hospital and followed the UCI&#8217;s concussion protocol. She was declared symptom-free, physically ready, and mentally motivated to race again by UAE Team ADQ. She will also race Sunday&#8217;s Amstel Gold Race, the mid-week La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge next Sunday.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini took her 50th career victory at the Dwars door Vlaanderen and appears on form for the hillier Ardennes Classics. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really look at numbers but it&#8217;s nice to win it twice,&#8221; Longo Borghini said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me health comes first and performance in second place. I felt well, so really wanted to give it a go,&#8221; she said, explaining her return to racing after her concussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice race and I really like the combination of the hills and the cobbles. It&#8217;s also a nice transition from the cobbled Classics to the Ardennes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good and with the team we planned for an aggressive race. We really wanted to try our chances.

The race is considered transitionary, positioned between the flatter cobbled classics and the steeper Ardennes classics races. The course features the cobbled Moskesstraat [nl] climb (550 metres in length, average gradient of 7.98% with a maximum gradient of 18%)</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) took a second consecutive victory at De Brabantse Pijl Dames, confirming she has recovered from the concussion she suffered during the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<p>The Italian National Champion rode an aggressive race and attacked alone on the Moskesstraat climb with 11km to race. She opened a 25-second gap and the chasers failed to close the gap on the successive Holstheide climb and the rise to the finish line. </p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) won the sprint for second place as Longo Borghini celebrated victory with two fingers in the air. Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) was third, with 14 riders in the case group that finished six seconds down.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini crashed hard during the Tour of Flanders and was forced to spend a night in hospital and followed the UCI&#8217;s concussion protocol. She was declared symptom-free, physically ready, and mentally motivated to race again by UAE Team ADQ. She will also race Sunday&#8217;s Amstel Gold Race, the mid-week La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge next Sunday.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini took her 50th career victory at the Dwars door Vlaanderen and appears on form for the hillier Ardennes Classics. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really look at numbers but it&#8217;s nice to win it twice,&#8221; Longo Borghini said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For me health comes first and performance in second place. I felt well, so really wanted to give it a go,&#8221; she said, explaining her return to racing after her concussion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice race and I really like the combination of the hills and the cobbles. It&#8217;s also a nice transition from the cobbled Classics to the Ardennes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good and with the team we planned for an aggressive race. We really wanted to try our chances.

It is part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour. The race is held on a Saturday, with the men&#8217;s race held the day after. The Paris‚ÄìRoubaix Femmes course uses the same roads and cobbled sectors as the men&#8217;s race ‚Äì albeit over a shorter distance (around 120 to 150km) ‚Äì before finishing in the Roubaix Velodrome.</p>\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) is the first Frenchwoman to win Paris-Roubaix Femmes. In her debut at the cobblestone race, she attacked from a group of favourites with 25km to go and bridged to Emma Norsgaard (Lidl-Trek) before dropping the Dane on the Camphin-en-P√©v√®le pav√© sector. </p>\n<p>With her teammate Marianne Vos policing the chase group, Ferrand-Pr√©vot soloed to the velodrome where she could take in the cheers of the crowd before raising her hands on the line.</p>\n<p>In the group behind, Letizia Borghesi (EF Education-Oatly) snuck away on the final kilometre to take the runner-up spot while Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) outsprinted Vos for third place.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI had a crash at the sector before Mons-en-P√©v√®le, so I had to chase, but Marianne [Vos] was at the front.

We said, OK, we just go, and worst-case scenario, I will do my best for Marianne. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúYeah, winning ill. It&#8217;s just amazing.

Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) attacked from the peloton coming out of sector 16 with 72.6km to go.</p>\n<p>The former World ITT champion had bridged to the front just before sector 13 where her pace was too much for Nerlo who had to drop back.

Eriƒá immediately went on the attack but was shut down by Kopecky.</p>\n<p>Kasper and Van Dijk were dropped on the Mons-en-P√©v√®le sector while Ferrand-Pr√©vot was chasing in a group about 30 seconds down. Kopecky then attacked on the small rise after the end of the pav√©, and only Vos could hold her wheel.</p>\n<p>Dygert chased hard to close the gap, leaving six riders at the front, but the other four didn‚Äôt want to work with Kopecky and Wiebes. Kopecky attacked again on sector 9, 39km from the finish, and again only Vos could stay with her.Then things came back together on the asphalt, and eventually Ferrand-Pr√©vot‚Äôs chase group reached the front to make it a group of more than 20 riders.</p>\n<p>After short-lived attacks by Eriƒá, Borghesi, Jackson and Van Dijk, Norsgaard made her move with 32.4km to go and quickly gained a 36-second advantage. With Kopecky leading the chase, this was reduced to 22 seconds on sector 7, and Ferrand-Pr√©vot then went off on a solo chase, reaching Norsgaard with 23km to go.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot left Norsgaard behind on sector 5, Camphin-en-P√©v√®le, and increased her gap to 45 seconds at the start of the final five-star sector 4, Carrefour de l‚ÄôArbre. Exiting the sector, she was 58 seconds ahead as Vos was shadowing moves in the group behind and disrupting the chase.</p>\n<p>Norsgaard was still trying to hold on for second place but was caught on sector 2 ‚Äì Ferrand-Pr√©vot‚Äôs victory was certain by that point. </p>\n<p>In the fight for second place, an attack by √âlise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) just inside the 5km mark led to a group of four that also included Vos, Borghesi, and Maria Giulia Confalonieri (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Chabbey‚Äôs acceleration finally dropped Kopecky, but Wiebes and Jackson came back.

It is an annual road bicycle racing event in Flanders, Belgium, held in early April. It is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, on much of the same roads but at a shorter distance. The event has been held annually since 2004 on the same day as the men&#8217;s race. From 2004 to 2015 it was part of the UCI Women&#8217;s Road World Cup. Since 2016, the race is included in the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier female elite competition. Since the first edition, organisers have included more climbs and extended the race gradually from 94 km in the first edition to 163 km in 2024.</p>\n<p>World champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) won the Tour of Flanders Women, beating Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Liane Lippert (Movistar), and Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) in a sprint of four riders in the elite lead group.</p>\n<p>The quartet had attacked from a group of 17 riders on the Oude Kwaremont, kept the pace up on the Paterberg and then worked together on the run-in to Oudenaarde to hold off the chasers.</p>\n<p>In the final kilometre, Niewiadoma tried to anticipate the sprint with an attack but sat up again when Kopecky closed the gap.</p>\n<p>Kopecky then controlled the group from the front, launching her sprint with just over 200 metres to go when Lippert got out of the saddle to sprint and keeping everybody behind her to win her third Tour of Flanders title.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy race with lots of crashes in the beginning,&#8221; said Kopecky after her victory. &#8220;It was pretty nervous, and I didn‚Äôt have the best legs in the beginning, but I tried to stay calm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a few climbs, my legs felt better and better, then I knew that in the end, I have a pretty good chance. Once we were with the four of us, I was pretty confident, actually. </p>\n<p>&#8220;After an hour or two, I felt good, so from that moment on, I knew that it was much better than Wednesday, so I just had to be confident. Once we got further into the race, Mischa [Bredewold] was out before the Oude Kruisberg, that was a really good move for us, so I think, again, with our team SD Worx-Protime, we did a really nice race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>The early breakaway formed soon after the start of the 168.9-kilometre race when Nicole Steigenga (AG Insurance-Soudal), Franziska Brau√üe (Ceratizit), Romy Kasper (Human Powered Health), Alison Avoine (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93), Britt de Grave (DD Group), April Tacey (Coop-Repsol), and Aoife O&#8217;Brien (DAS-Hutchinson) got away. Their advantage maxed out at over seven minutes before coming down again.</p>\n<p>There were numerous crashes in the peloton, and 2024 race winner Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) was the most prominent victim, having to abandon the race. Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) and Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) also hit the ground but were able to continue.</p>\n<p>After the Berendries, only Steigenga, Brau√üe, De Grave, and Tacey were left in front, with the peloton just over four minutes behind. Jade Wiel (FDJ-Suez) attacked from the bunch on the Valkenberg, initiating a flurry of moves that led to a chase group of ten riders, but this group was short-lived.</p>\n<p>Steigenga went solo on the Eikenberg with 52km to go, leaving her companions behind and starting the Koppenberg with a 30-second lead on Tacey while the peloton followed at 1:46 minutes. Unlike last year, the cobbles were dry, and there was no mass dismount as most riders could ride up the steep climb ‚Äì a notable exception was Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>17 riders were still together after the Koppenberg, with another 24 riders returning before the next climb, the Steenbeekdries, where Steigenga was caught. On the cobbled descent of the Stationsberg, Elise Chabbey, Amber Kraak (both FDJ-Suez), and Ferrand-Pr√©vot crashed in a corner, but were soon back on their bikes.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek lit up the race after the Taaienberg as Ellen van Dijk, Anna Henderson, and Lauretta Hanson took turns attacking. The Australian succeeded in getting away with Bredewold, and they held a 20-second gap going into the Oude Kruisberg.</p>\n<p>Lippert attacked on this cobbled climb, bridging to Hanson and Bredewold. Pieterse then used the Hotond to close the gap to the trio, putting 17 riders at the front of the race. They included Van Dijk, Henderson, Hanson (all  Lidl-Trek), Anna van der Breggen, Kopecky, Bredewold (all SD Worx-Protime), Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, Marlen Reusser (both Movistar), Noemi R√ºegg, Letizia Borghesi (both EF Education-Oatly), Letizia Paternoster (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Niewiadoma, Chlo√© Dygert (both Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Pieterse, Chabbey, and Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal).</p>\n<p>Dygert, Van Dijk, and Henderson all attacked on the run-in to the Oude Kwaremont but could not get away. Instead, Reusser led the group onto the key climb of the race, and when the cobbles began and the gradients hit, Ferrand-Pr√©vot, Lippert, and Kopecky pulled away from the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>Henderson and Chabbey unsuccessfully tried to get back on. Paternoster had almost made it to Kopecky‚Äôs rear when Niewiadoma passed her and closed the last gap, but when Kopecky pushed the pace on the flatter second half of the climb, Paternoster blew apart and dropped back, leaving four riders at the front, 12 seconds ahead of the next group.</p>\n<p>The gap had increased slightly to 15 seconds at the foot of the Paterberg where Ferrand-Pr√©vot and Niewiadoma hit hard from the bottom, wanting to keep the chase group away and maybe drop some of the other frontrunners. Lippert replied and came to the front on the last part of the climb while Kopecky was content to follow the others‚Äô wheels.</p>\n<p>The headwind on the run-in to the finish Oudenaarde discouraged attacks, and the four riders seemed happy to work together until the flamme rouge, extending their advantage to over a minute. After Niewiadoma‚Äôs attack, Kopecky led out the sprint to take a record third Tour of Flanders victory, and 1:13 minutes later, Le Court won the sprint for fifth place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9049&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is an annual road bicycle racing event in Flanders, Belgium, held in early April. It is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, on much of the same roads but at a shorter distance. The event has been held annually since 2004 on the same day as the men&#8217;s race. From 2004 to 2015 it was part of the UCI Women&#8217;s Road World Cup. Since 2016, the race is included in the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour, cycling&#8217;s top-tier female elite competition. Since the first edition, organisers have included more climbs and extended the race gradually from 94 km in the first edition to 163 km in 2024.</p>\n<p>World champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) won the Tour of Flanders Women, beating Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike), Liane Lippert (Movistar), and Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) in a sprint of four riders in the elite lead group.</p>\n<p>The quartet had attacked from a group of 17 riders on the Oude Kwaremont, kept the pace up on the Paterberg and then worked together on the run-in to Oudenaarde to hold off the chasers.</p>\n<p>In the final kilometre, Niewiadoma tried to anticipate the sprint with an attack but sat up again when Kopecky closed the gap.</p>\n<p>Kopecky then controlled the group from the front, launching her sprint with just over 200 metres to go when Lippert got out of the saddle to sprint and keeping everybody behind her to win her third Tour of Flanders title.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy race with lots of crashes in the beginning,&#8221; said Kopecky after her victory. &#8220;It was pretty nervous, and I didn‚Äôt have the best legs in the beginning, but I tried to stay calm.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a few climbs, my legs felt better and better, then I knew that in the end, I have a pretty good chance.

The race starts in Roeselare and finishes in Waregem, both in West Flanders. Since 2017 the event is included in the UCI World Tour. Since 2012, a women&#8217;s edition of Dwars door Vlaanderen is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, starting and finishing on the same location, over a shorter distance. From 2023, this event joined the UCI Women&#8217;s ProSeries calendar, the second tier of women&#8217;s races.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) used her trademark late-race attack to net a solo victory at the mid-week Dwars door Vlaanderen, in what is often referred to as the dress rehearsal for the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<p>The Italian Champion bridged across to a fading breakaway, and without even taking a breathe, launched herself off the front in what was a 30km solo effort into the finish line to take her 50th career win in Waregem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was more like revenge for Milan-San Remo where they caught be with 150m to go,&#8221; said Longo Borghini, who also made a late-race attack at the Milan-San Remo two weeks ago but was caught at the line, dreams of winning her home Monument shattered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was very hungry for the victory here. I really wanted to  prove that I was strong. There was some frustration in the last weeks, and I need to thank my trainer who is always keeping me calm. It is always nice to win with the tricolour and UAE jersey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An unorganised chase group sprinted for the minor places on the podium won by world champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) for second place and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) in third, narrowly holding off the next group behind.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe women&#8217;s peloton tackled a 128.5km route in and around Waregem for the mid-week Classics and a final test before the Tour of Flanders on Sunday. The ProSeries race saw the peloton compete across seven climbs and six cobblestone sectors on the edge of the Flemish Ardennes.

The race starts in Roeselare and finishes in Waregem, both in West Flanders. Since 2017 the event is included in the UCI World Tour. Since 2012, a women&#8217;s edition of Dwars door Vlaanderen is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, starting and finishing on the same location, over a shorter distance. From 2023, this event joined the UCI Women&#8217;s ProSeries calendar, the second tier of women&#8217;s races.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) used her trademark late-race attack to net a solo victory at the mid-week Dwars door Vlaanderen, in what is often referred to as the dress rehearsal for the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n<p>The Italian Champion bridged across to a fading breakaway, and without even taking a breathe, launched herself off the front in what was a 30km solo effort into the finish line to take her 50th career win in Waregem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was more like revenge for Milan-San Remo where they caught be with 150m to go,&#8221; said Longo Borghini, who also made a late-race attack at the Milan-San Remo two weeks ago but was caught at the line, dreams of winning her home Monument shattered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was very hungry for the victory here. I really wanted to  prove that I was strong. There was some frustration in the last weeks, and I need to thank my trainer who is always keeping me calm. It is always nice to win with the tricolour and UAE jersey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An unorganised chase group sprinted for the minor places on the podium won by world champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) for second place and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) in third, narrowly holding off the next group behind.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe women&#8217;s peloton tackled a 128.5km route in and around Waregem for the mid-week Classics and a final test before the Tour of Flanders on Sunday. The ProSeries race saw the peloton compete across seven climbs and six cobblestone sectors on the edge of the Flemish Ardennes. The top of the last climb of the day, Nokere was positioned at 9.8 kilometres from the finish back in Waregem.</p>\n<p>Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) was noticeably absent from the start line due to illness, though she will still be racing at the Tour of Flanders on the weekend.</p>\n<p>Several short-lived attacks came early in the race from Anna van Wersch (Lotto Ladies), and Yonna Van Dam (DD Group Pro Cycling), but all were brought back into the fold within the first 50km.</p>\n<p>The first part of the race was also marred by several crashes, some who were forced to abandon included Hannah Kunz (UAE Team ADQ) and Martina Fidanza (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>As the race hit the halfway mark, accelerations came from World Champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) and Marlen Reusser (Movistar), causing a split in the field with a front group of about 20 riders, which stayed away for the rest of the race.</p>\n<p>There was no rest in the front group as Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) and Lianne Lippert (Movistar) continued over the Knokteberg.

It is one of the classic races part of the Flemish Cycling Week, run in late March on the last Sunday before the Tour of Flanders. Although the event is often called a sprinters&#8217; classic due to its flat finishing terrain, its early-season date means riders are often tested by wind and rain, as well as several climbs, including two ascents of the steep and fully cobbled Kemmelberg. As a result, few editions of Gent‚ÄìWevelgem actually end in a bunch sprint ‚Äì often the winner comes from a small group of escapees.

Launching her sprint with 200 metres to go from the wheel of her teammate, world champion Lotte Kopecky, Wiebes was untouchable, with Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) and Charlotte Kool (Picnic-PostNL) not even trying to come around her and settling for second and third.</p>\n<p>Kopecky had ridden hard up the second ascent of the Kemmelberg, splitting the peloton and initiating a front group of five that also included Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), Wiebes, Letizia Borghesi (EF Education-Oatly), and Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>But Longo Borghini was not taking any turns, and they were only 15 seconds ahead of the peloton where Lidl-Trek were chasing hard. Wiebes and Kopecky attacked in turns to make Longo Borghini chase, and the two groups eventually merged with 27km to go.</p>\n<p>Although there was no shortage of attacks on the run-in to Wevelgem and Lidl-Trek even tried to force echelons, nobody got away for longer than a few seconds, and when the sprinters&#8217; teams took control, a bunch sprint was inevitable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good on the Kemmelberg.

They built an advantage of over four minutes before the peloton took up the chase.</p>\n<p>A crash in De Moeren split the peloton and forced Nienke Veenhoven (Visma-Lease a Bike) to abandon. The two groups came back together before the race was split again in a crosswind section. At the 100km mark, though, the peloton was together again.</p>\n<p>They were up to 24 seconds ahead but were caught again atop the Baneberg, 40km from the line and five kilometres from the second time up the Kemmelberg, this time on the shorter but steeper west side called the Ossuaire.</p>\n<p>Again, Kopecky went hard from the bottom, and only Longo Borghini and Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) could follow her at first before Wiebes, Borghesi, and Dygert made it back to their wheels near the top.

Elisa Winter of the Union Raiffeisen Radteam Tirol secured 5th place as the best Austrian, 14 seconds behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17369&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17369&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The group broke up on the first slopes, and the breakaway riders gradually increased their lead. However, behind them, the peloton reacted, and on the second pass through Lierni, they were absorbed, forming a group of around 40 riders. Despite this, Larrarte from Tolosa wanted to continue showing off her good form in front of her home crowd and tried her luck alongside 18-year-old German rider Joelle Amelie Messemer on the final pass through Lierni. Both riders started Olaberria with a significant lead over the chasing group, but leader Valgonen couldn&#8217;t keep up with the pace on the Gipuzkoa slopes. Larrarte and Messemer reached the sprint, with the Canyon rider overtaking the Massi Baix Ter rider, who became the new leader of the competition. Behind them, a group finished 19 seconds behind, led by UPV rider Diana Smirnova, who became the best U23 rider in the Spanish Cup. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17323&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17323&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is held on the same day as the men&#8217;s race, over a shorter distance but with an identical finish in Sanremo.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) won the 2025 Milan-San Remo Women, crossing the line first in the sprint of a small group ahead of Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), with Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) finishing third.</p>\n<p>Pauline Ferrand-Pr√®vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) initially finished fourth on the day but was later relegated to 12th place.</p>\n<p>After a hectic descent from the Poggio, Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) attacked right away and got a sizeable gap at first until Wiebes&#8217; teammate, world champion Lotte Kopecky went all-out in the chase.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini was a few seconds ahead at the flamme rouge, and Vos was first to launch her sprint, prompting Wiebes to react. As they passed Longo Borghini, Vos took the lead, but Wiebes had a last punch left, passing Vos in the final ten metres to win.</p>\n<p>Asked if her victory had sunk in yet, Wiebes said in a post-race interview, &#8220;Not yet I think but I had to finish the teamwork off. I&#8217;m really grateful for the team how we worked as a team and what Lotte did in the final I&#8217;m super grateful for.</p>\n<p>Wiebes said she felt good on the Cipressa, among the reduced group, and was able to stay with the top riders over the Poggio, too, and that is when she knew she could contest the final. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think there were multiple options but I felt that I did good on the Cipressa so also on the Poggio, I was with the first five or something at the top and then I knew I would ride for the win. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Longo Borghini did a really strong attack but I saw Lotte was close behind and, as I said, the effort she made was amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wiebes also said she was not worried about the descent or the final kilometre where Longo Borghini made a surprise attack, knowing Kopecky was there to bring the Italian back into the fold in the final metres. </p>\n<p>&#8220;No. I knew how strong Lotte is and she put me in the perfect position. I need to say Vos surprised me a little bit. I didn&#8217;t want to open my sprint too early but it was enough for the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in Genoa, the 156-kilometre women‚Äôs race took place almost exclusively on the Via Aurelia, the Ligurian coastal road, with the climbs of the Cipressa and Poggio being the only exceptions.</p>\n<p>Early attacks from Anne Knijnenburg (VolkerWessels) and Nikola Noskov√° (Cofidis) were quickly reeled in again, and it was only when Knijnenburg attacked again after more than 60km that a breakaway was established.</p>\n<p>Laura Tomasi (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) and Virginia Bortoli (Top Girls Fassa Bortolo) formed a chase duo, and with 68km to go, they were a minute and 20 seconds behind Knijnenburg, with the peloton at 2:30 minutes.</p>\n<p>A crash 54km from the line briefly held up Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), among others, but she easily returned to the peloton. Soon after, Tomasi and Bortoli were caught while Knijnenburg made it over the Capo Mele solo, only being reeled in after the descent, just inside the 50-kilometre mark.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike, Fenix-Deceunick, and FDJ-Suez set a high pace on the Capo Cervo and Capo Berta, reducing the peloton, but none of the favourites were in difficulty yet. A crash near the front of the pack with 30.5km to go took down a.o. Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Kopecky and held up Wiebes, temporarily fracturing the peloton in the run-in to the Cipressa.</p>\n<p>After a hectic chase, most crashed riders returned to the front ahead of the Cipressa, and about sixty riders started the longest climb of the day together. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) and Loes Adegeest (FDJ-Suez) set a hard pace on the first half of the 5.6km climb. When they swung off, Lidl-Trek took control, reducing the speed to protect Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot went into the descent first and stretched out the peloton, leading to a group of 13 riders having a gap at the bottom that included Longo Borghini, Kopecky, Wiebes, Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Demi Vollering, Juliette Labous (both FDJ-Suez), Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Balsamo, Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco). Only Vas and Kopecky wanted to keep the group going, though, and things came back together with 15km to go.</p>\n<p>Following another fast run-in, 21 riders entered the Poggio together. Vas briefly set the pace, then Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) came to the front and went to work with her team‚Äôs leader Niewiadoma slotting in behind her.</p>\n<p>Labous made her move about a kilometre from the top, prompting counterattacks by Niewiadoma and Le Court, but none of them could shake off the rest of the favourites. When Vollering attacked just before the top, it was more to get a good position for the descent than anything else.</p>\n<p>Vollering led the race down most of the descent with riders in single file behind her. Pieterse took over on the last bit, and when they had reached the bottom of the descent, Longo Borghini immediately launched her all-or-nothing attack. The Italian champion quickly gained a gap, but Kopecky went to the front of the 12-rider chase group almost as quickly and started to chase in service of her teammate Wiebes.</p>\n<p>After the 250-metre mark, with Kopecky still about ten metres behind Longo Borghini, Vos launched her sprint from sixth position, anticipating Wiebes. Because of the head start, Vos took the lead, but Wiebes was still winding up her sprint and came past on the last metres to take the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I didn&#8217;t want to open my sprint too early but it was enough for the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in Genoa, the 156-kilometre women‚Äôs race took place almost exclusively on the Via Aurelia, the Ligurian coastal road, with the climbs of the Cipressa and Poggio being the only exceptions.</p>\n<p>Early attacks from Anne Knijnenburg (VolkerWessels) and Nikola Noskov√° (Cofidis) were quickly reeled in again, and it was only when Knijnenburg attacked again after more than 60km that a breakaway was established.</p>\n<p>Laura Tomasi (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) and Virginia Bortoli (Top Girls Fassa Bortolo) formed a chase duo, and with 68km to go, they were a minute and 20 seconds behind Knijnenburg, with the peloton at 2:30 minutes.</p>\n<p>A crash 54km from the line briefly held up Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek), among others, but she easily returned to the peloton. Soon after, Tomasi and Bortoli were caught while Knijnenburg made it over the Capo Mele solo, only being reeled in after the descent, just inside the 50-kilometre mark.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike, Fenix-Deceunick, and FDJ-Suez set a high pace on the Capo Cervo and Capo Berta, reducing the peloton, but none of the favourites were in difficulty yet. A crash near the front of the pack with 30.5km to go took down a.o. Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Kopecky and held up Wiebes, temporarily fracturing the peloton in the run-in to the Cipressa.</p>\n<p>After a hectic chase, most crashed riders returned to the front ahead of the Cipressa, and about sixty riders started the longest climb of the day together. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) and Loes Adegeest (FDJ-Suez) set a hard pace on the first half of the 5.6km climb. When they swung off, Lidl-Trek took control, reducing the speed to protect Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Ferrand-Pr√©vot went into the descent first and stretched out the peloton, leading to a group of 13 riders having a gap at the bottom that included Longo Borghini, Kopecky, Wiebes, Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Demi Vollering, Juliette Labous (both FDJ-Suez), Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Balsamo, Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco). Only Vas and Kopecky wanted to keep the group going, though, and things came back together with 15km to go.</p>\n<p>Following another fast run-in, 21 riders entered the Poggio together. Vas briefly set the pace, then Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) came to the front and went to work with her team‚Äôs leader Niewiadoma slotting in behind her.</p>\n<p>Labous made her move about a kilometre from the top, prompting counterattacks by Niewiadoma and Le Court, but none of them could shake off the rest of the favourites. When Vollering attacked just before the top, it was more to get a good position for the descent than anything else.</p>\n<p>Vollering led the race down most of the descent with riders in single file behind her. Pieterse took over on the last bit, and when they had reached the bottom of the descent, Longo Borghini immediately launched her all-or-nothing attack. The Italian champion quickly gained a gap, but Kopecky went to the front of the 12-rider chase group almost as quickly and started to chase in service of her teammate Wiebes.</p>\n<p>After the 250-metre mark, with Kopecky still about ten metres behind Longo Borghini, Vos launched her sprint from sixth position, anticipating Wiebes. Because of the head start, Vos took the lead, but Wiebes was still winding up her sprint and came past on the last metres to take the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12235&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It‚Äôs for all of us today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a long sprint, because the final climb was hurting already, but one last kilometre was really long, and then I was only hearing in my ear ‚Äògo, go, go for it!‚Äô and then I just kept pushing, then I saw the line and I‚Äôm first. I was like ‚Äòoh my god, I can‚Äôt believe it!'&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe hilly, cobbled race got off to a fast start on Wednesday morning, with the high pace and technical laps meaning that no early break went, and things were still all together after 50km of racing.</p>\n<p>After 70km, a rider did finally get away when Sweden‚Äôs Stina Kagevi (Team Coop-Repsol) broke off the front of the peloton. The previously very controlled bunch clearly weren‚Äôt too worried about one solo attacker, as they let Kagevi quickly build a lead of a minute as things settled slightly.</p>\n<p>The calm didn‚Äôt last long, however, with the final 50km ushering in more action as several teams pushed the pace of the Lange Ast climb, which started to whittle down the bunch. On the flat, it was various individual riders who were injecting some aggression into the race, with sporadic attacks rather than a concerted effort from any one team.</p>\n<p>The left Kagevi hanging out front for quite some time, but heading towards the final 30km the pace really lifted and started eating into the Swedish rider‚Äôs lead. SD Worx-Protime, Lidl-Trek and FDJ-SUEZ were consistently trying to force a move off the front of the peloton, but it was tough to break the elastic with some really dangerous riders getting involved in the action.</p>\n<p>Kagevi was looking remarkably strong up front, not letting herself sit up even when the peloton was close, and pulled her lead back out again when the bunch settled, but she was finally caught with 20km to go.</p>\n<p>With a tough finale awaiting, there was some hesitance to just ride towards a sprint finish so the attacks continued, but still no one could quite make anything stick on the tarmac.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility‚Äôs Aniina Ahtosalo was a key protagonist, always instigating attacks and leading the bunch across the cobbled sectors. With 11km to go, Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Anna Henderson attacked on a cobbled sector to open up a dangerous gap, but she was brought back with 7km to go as Visma-Lease a Bike led the chase.</p>\n<p>Three riders tried to go on the counter-attack after the catch, but everything was together with 4km to go as it looked like a large uphill sprint was coming in Nokere.</p>\n<p>Fenix-Deceuninck and Uno-X Mobility had the most organised lead-outs heading into the final, and the Norwegians looked to have got it perfectly with Zanetti leading into the final 50 metres. However, one last acceleration from Lach proved too much as the SD Worx rider sealed victory, extending the team‚Äôs Nokere Koerse winning streak to five.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10430&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=10430&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1974, Trofeo Alfredo Binda is one of the oldest and most established races in the women&#8217;s calendar, and has been part of the UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour since its inception in 2016.</p>\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) has won her third Trofeo Alfredo Binda in four years, sprinting to victory ahead of Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) and Cat Ferguson (Movistar) after a group of four that had attacked on the Orino climb was caught on the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Six riders had gone clear over the top of the final climb but were caught again on the descent. Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) then made another move with 4km to go, and when Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ), Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), and Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) bridged to her, a high-speed chase was on.</p>\n<p>The four riders still had a small gap at the flamme rouge but were caught in the corner that led onto the finishing straight, and Balsamo emerged as the strongest in the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m speechless. It was one of the hardest races ever for me, the last two laps were crazy,&#8221; Balsamo said after the race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My teammates did a great job, and I&#8217;m very happy. It&#8217;s always so nice to win in Italy and at this race, so it&#8217;s a perfect day,&#8221; said the three-time winner after the race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really like this race, and now I know every single metre of the race. Today, a lot of friends and all my family were there, they were pushing me in the last climb, every ten metres there was someone, and I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton stayed together for the first third of the 152-kilometre race until a group of 14 riders used the Orino climb to get away on the first of six laps of the finishing circuit.</p>\n<p>With Nina Buijsman, Eglantine Rayer (both FDJ-Suez), Francesca Barale (Picnic-PostNL), Neve Bradbury, Antonia Niedermaier (both Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), Fem van Empel (Visma-Lease a Bike), Ella Wyllie (Liv-AlUla-Jayco), Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek), Eleonora Gasparrini (UAE Team ADQ), Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime), Sara Casasola (Fenix-Deceuninck), Mareille Meijering (Movistar), and Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility), most big teams were represented up front, and the break could increase its advantage to 1:25 minutes before AG Insurance-Soudal took up the chase.</p>\n<p>With three laps or 52.8km to go, the gap was down to 30 seconds, and the group was reeled in before the Orino climb. Dominika W≈Çodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) and Magdeleine Vallieres Mill (EF Education-Oatly) started the climb with a 13-second advantage, but only W≈Çodarczyk could stay ahead over the top as attacks from Vollering, Longo Borghini, Van der Breggen, and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek) strung out the peloton.</p>\n<p>W≈Çodarczyk was caught on the descent where Van der Breggen used her bike-handling skills to eke out a gap, and the 34-year-old was 18 seconds ahead when she crossed the finish line to start the final lap while Vollering was leading the chase.</p>\n<p>UAE Team ADQ came to the front in the flat part of the course, setting up Longo Borghini&#8217;s attack on the Casalzuigno climb. Together with Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike), the Italian champion bridged to Van der Breggen and left her behind. Vollering came past from further back, cresting the climb first with Longo Borghini on her wheel.</p>\n<p>After the descent, Vos, Pieterse, Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Mavi Garc√≠a, and Silke Smulders (both Liv-AlUla-Jayco) had closed the gap, and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (Visma-Lease a Bike) bridged with 12km to go to form a lead group of nine riders ‚Äì but this group wouldn&#8217;t work together, and the peloton was back a kilometre later, just before the start of the climb to Orino.</p>\n<p>Evita Muzic (FDJ-Suez) launched an attack on the lower slopes but could not get away. Longo Borghini then made her move on the steepest part of the climb, 8km from the line, and only Pieterse was able to follow, with Marta Cavalli (Picnic-PostNL), Vos, and Vollering having to dig deep to stay in touch.</p>\n<p>On the last part of the climb, Vollering launched another attack past Longo Borghini and Pieterse that Vos couldn&#8217;t follow while Le Court and W≈Çodarczyk bridged from behind as they went into the descent.</p>\n<p>This group of six had a small advantage over the reduced peloton where SD Worx-Protime and Liv-AlUla-Jayco were chasing. Just before the peloton made contact, Pieterse made her last move to get a gap, and Longo Borghini, Vollering, and Trinca Colonel got back to the 22-year-old Dutchwoman&#8217;s wheel with 3km to go.</p>\n<p>The run-in to the finish was a high-speed chase where Gerritse and Van der Breggen slowly but surely closed the gap, catching the front group in the final corner of the race.</p>\n<p>Ferguson launched her sprint coming out of the corner and soon passed Vollering, but Balsamo came up fast on the left-hand side of the road and won the sprint. Vas came out of Ferguson&#8217;s slipstream on the last 50 metres to take second place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9046&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9046&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Not present in the group was Charlotte Kool (Picnic-PostNL), who crashed on a cobbled section a few kilometres before.</p>\n<p>In a fifth edition, the Belgian race was upgraded to UCI 1.Pro this year and 12 Women&#8217;s WorldTour teams packed the field that took on 128km from Sint-Pieters-Leeuw to six finish circuits in Oetingen.</p>\n<p>Despite several attacks flying at the start of the race, the peloton left any prospective breakaway riders no room to manoeuvre during the contest. As a result, the main group held together as the riders hit the early cobblestone sectors and onto the first lap of the finishing circuit, 80km from the line. </p>\n<p>A brief split in the peloton 10km later was quickly undone, with UAE Team ADQ swiftly taking control of the situation shortly afterwards on the second of the seven laps.</p>\n<p>Two short cobbled sectors and the 500-metre, 7% climb of the Zavelberg provoked further brief splits in the peloton at 50km and 40km to go as Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto and Fenix-Deceuninck pulled things along ‚Äì in addition to a testing move from Anna Henderson (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>The moves weren‚Äôt enough to break things up permanently, though there was some slimming out in the group as the attrition struck. A mix of teams pulled at the front, though Zoe B√§ckstedt (Canyon-SRAM Zondacrypto) wouldn‚Äôt be there for the final 20km thanks to a crash.</p>\n<p>The big split came on the penultimate climb of the Zavelberg heading towards the final lap, with around 30 riders breaking away off the front.</p>\n<p>Fenix-Deceuninck took over at the front of the road heading into the final 10km, while other teams including Lidl-Trek, SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike, and Uno-X Mobility also had multiple riders in the move.</p>\n<p>The riders hit the final two cobbled sectors at 5km to go, with Visma and Fenix leading from the front. A crash on the first of the two saw Kool among those hitting the deck, with the Dutchwoman ruled out of contesting the finish as a result.</p>\n<p>In the final run towards the finish, the strength of three teammates to support De Wilde was evident as she scored her second victory of the season. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14770&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14770&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Created in 2023, it was immediately included in the UCI Women&#8217;s International Calendar in the 2.2 class.</p>\n<p>Imogen Wolf (Visma-Lease a Bike), 18, took the first professional victory of her career at stage 3 of the Vuelta a Extremadura Femenina, beating Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) and Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek) in a wet sprint finish in Herv√°s.</p>\n<p>After building a big enough lead in the stage 1a time trial, Van Dijk&#8217;s third-place finish meant she held onto the overall lead and claimed the GC victory in Spain ahead of Ottestad, who started the final day of racing six seconds behind the Dutch veteran.</p>\n<p>Ottestad finished second overall, capping off a great three days of racing after already netting a stage win on Friday. Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ) took third on GC thanks to the time she gained by winning stage 1b.</p>\n<p>The stage was due to be one for the climbers, with two category 1 climbs along the route, however, awful wet weather in the Extremadura region in Western Spain meant the stage was shortened to just 69km with both of the climbs removed.</p>\n<p>This allowed the likes of Van Dijk to contest the overall, and with any would-be attackers kept in control by her teammates, she was able to take the first GC win since returning from giving birth to her first child in 2023.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the easiest to control because there were lots of girls who could still win the race and I didn&#8217;t have a big advantage so we had to be super sharp. The girls were going full gas and were so impressive,&#8221; said Van Dijk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the intermediate sprint, we lost two seconds so it made it even tighter. On the last climb, the girls did a full lead-out for me and I knew I had to finish it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy I could win this GC, especially to pay back all the hard work done by the girls. It was a great week here with a great atmosphere among the team. My focus was to win the time trial on stage 1a so to win the overall is such a nice bonus.

Copponi was briefly awarded third place but after review of the photo finish, Lloyd was ultimately named as third place finisher.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek had been working to protect the interests of race leader Ellen van Dijk, who won the stage 1a time trial, and though they didn‚Äôt close the gap, Marturano started the stage 50 seconds down on GC and Van Dijk finished in the bunch meaning she will hold on to the yellow leader‚Äôs jersey going into stage 2 on Friday.  </p>\n<p>This is 26-year-old Marturano‚Äôs first win as a professional, after moving to UAE Team ADQ from Fenix-Deceuninck over the winter. </p>\n<p>With two stages remaining, Van Dijk leads Mie Bj√∏rndal (Uno-X Mobility) by 10 seconds while Marturano moved up to third, 19 seconds down.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe were chasing, but we got a little bit different messages on the time gap, so we actually thought we were closer, but in the end we heard all of a sudden that we were not so close, so we had to go full gas,‚Äù Van Dijk said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe came too late in the end. Other teams were helping so that was good, but the chase was not fast enough because we thought we were closer, but the riders in the breakaway also had a really strong ride, so chapeau to them.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Coming after the morning‚Äôs 9km time trial, stage 1b comprised a 90km point-to-point route with just one categorised climb but plenty of rolling roads in Extremadura to make things difficult.</p>\n<p>The stage started with a very compact peloton and it took a long time for any attacks to start forming, and those that did try were closed down very quickly by Lidl-Trek and Uno-X Mobility, looking to protect the GC positions of Van Dijk, Mie Bj√∏rndal and Katrine Aalerud.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the category 3 climb with around 40km to go, Greta Marturano and Sigrid Haugset attacked and became the day‚Äôs breakaway, building up a gap of over two minutes, leaving the peloton quite a lot of work to do before the finale.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek and Visma-Lease a Bike were leading the chase, but with 10km to go the gap was still 1:18 with Marturano and Haugset working well together. In the final 5km their advantage started falling more rapidly, and it hung in the balance whether the catch would be made, but ultimately the peloton gave the strong escapees too much leeway, and the pair were able to race for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19315&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19315&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event was created in 1968 as Grand Prix de Fayt-le-Franc, named after the former municipality where it started and finished. In 1970 it was renamed Grand Prix Jos√© Samyn as a tribute to Jos√© Samyn, the race&#8217;s first winner who died in a race accident in 1969.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) stormed to victory at Le Samyn des Dames 2025 with a dominant sprint, managing the uphill finish without a lead-out to still win with a big margin.</p>\n<p>The Dutch sprinter was isolated in the finale as Liv AlUla Jayco showed off their firepower, however, the Australian team and the rest of the bunch couldn&#8217;t match Wiebes once she launched for the line in Dour. </p>\n<p>Linda Zanetti (Uno-X Mobility) took a strong second for the Norwegian squad, narrowly pipping Lara Gillespie (UAE Team ADQ) to the line.</p>\n<p>23-year-old Irish sprinter Gillespie continued her bright start to the season with a third-place finish, adding to the second-place finish she scored at Omloop van het Hageland on Sunday. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to win in the spring, and it&#8217;s nice to do it in this race, and actually, I enjoyed it,&#8221; said Wiebes, who relished the 122km of cobbled racing. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was pretty chaotic, like always on the Belgian roads. We had a good position every time going into the cobbled section, the team did a good job. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we lost Elena Cecchini in a crash, so we had one rider less, but the girls brought me perfectly every time on the cobbles. One time, I tried it myself because I had good legs &#8211; I enjoyed it</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had good legs today, so I felt really ready for the sprint, and I like it when it&#8217;s slightly uphill also.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the breakaway&#8217;s success from Omloop Het Nieuwsblad Women at the weekend, there was little freedom given to any attacker throughout the four laps in and around the Dour circuit in Wallonia that was tackled four times at Le Samyn des Dames.</p>\n<p>Deborah Veerman (VELOPRO &#8211; Alphamotorhomes) and Cleo Kiekens (DD Group) briefly enjoyed a small advantage, and the likes of Romina Hinojosa (Lotto) tried to attack, however, SD Worx-Protime stayed vigilant in the chase to ensure Wiebes had the chance to spring.</p>\n<p>The strongest team, though, were not the usual dominant force in women&#8217;s cycling, SD Worx, but Liv AlUla Jayco, who not only tried to attack with Ruby Roseman-Gannon but also commanded the front position heading into the two final cobbled climbs. </p>\n<p>There were several crashes in the final 37km, with Katrijn de Clercq (Lotto), Lizzie Holden (UAE Team ADQ) and Gladys Verhulst-Wild (AG Insurance-Soudal) among the riders to go down.</p>\n<p>The best late attack came from Cofidis 12km from the finish, when Slovenian veteran Eugenia Bujak took her chance to peel off the front of the peloton. She only built a small gap but managed to stay out in front until after the final cobbled climb.</p>\n<p>With Bujak back in, Liv AlUla Jayco continued to lead the peloton, and by now, Wiebes had taken it upon herself to move up solo without many teammates left in the bunch. </p>\n<p>The Australian squad were working for Georgia Baker, who ended the day in fifth after a top lead-out, however, she was quickly overhauled by the superior Wiebes, who powered out of her wheel to a seemingly easy victory &#8211; the 97th of her career.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9206&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9206&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Originally a 1.2 rated race by the UCI, it is now a 1.1 category race. Before 2011 the race was a criterium of category 1.NE and was called Tielt-Winge (Wielertrofee Vlaanderen). The race route is usually flat with a few stretches of cobbles and the repeated ascent of the Roeselberg. The race can be won by sprinters and breakaway groups.</p>\n<p>Femke Gerritse outsprinted her breakaway companions to win Omloop van het Hageland in Tielt-Winge and claim the first professional victory of her career on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old Dutch rider launched her sprint inside of 300 metres to go, benefitting from a leadout from her SD Worx-Protime teammate Anna van der Breggen who had already done yeoman‚Äôs work in the break.</p>\n<p>Lara Gillespie (UAE Team ADQ), on Gerritse‚Äôs wheel, who took the outside and therefore longer line, surged forward with a big turn of speed but came short, taking second place by a tire width.</p>\n<p>Susanne Andersen (Uno-X Mobility) finished third.</p>\n<p>Going into the finish, the SD Worx plan was for Van der Breggen to attack on the final cobbled climb, and Gerritse to let the gap open behind her, but Van der Breggen &#8220;said, I&#8217;m dead&#8221;, and that she could not accelerate any more so the team switched their plan to a small group sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I focused on my sprint and to be in a good position. I think I was fourth wheel of the group, so I was satisfied with this position. And I thought, ‚Äòokay, I need to go on my on the left side‚Äô, and I wanted to do my own sprint. So I was waiting, waiting, and then I thought, I go. And then I started, and I was like ‚Äòah it&#8217;s so far‚Äô. So I was waiting till the others came, and they didn&#8217;t come, and then one girl came on the finish line. I was like, ‚ÄòNo, I am second‚Äô,&#8221; Gerritse said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My goal this year was to make the next step, the next bigger step, and to be on a few podium spots in the season. But now, the second race, already I won. So we see how it will go [for the rest of the season]. But I&#8217;m very happy with this one, it‚Äôs already in the pocket.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A disappointed Gillespie admitted that she started her sprint &#8220;too late, I should have gone earlier.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall it‚Äôs a really good result but I‚Äôm slightly disappointed because I felt really good. I think I held back a bit too much so that‚Äôs really a shame but I&#8217;m really happy for this and for the team and I‚Äôm really grateful that the team supported me all day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;She [Anna van der Breggen] has been an inspiration growing up, so that was really cool. I‚Äôm confident in my shape and felt really good to be there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After yesterday‚Äôs debacle for the top teams at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad including SD Worx-Protime, van der Breggen took control of the peloton in the 135.6km Classic, the second race of the Opening Weekend.</p>\n<p>After a flurry of nullified attacks from many teams, Van der Breggen made her presence known with a first attack causing a brief break with 77 kilometres to go.  The former World champion made another massive acceleration on the Kerkstraat cobbles to split the peloton inside of 55 kilometres to go.  </p>\n<p>Making the split were Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL), Gillespie, Andersen and two teammates Simone Boilard, and Maria Giulia Confalonieri, Cofidis duo of Victoire Berteau and Valentine Fortin, and Van der Breggen and her teammates Gerritse and Elena Cecchini. Also making the splits were three riders from Canyon-Sram: Chiara Consonni, Anastasiya Kolesava and Maike Van der Duin, four from Fenix Deceuninck: Puck Pieterse Millie Couzens, Christina Schweinberger and Marthe Truyen, and two from Visma-Lease A Bike: Eva Van Agt and Nienke Veenhoven, </p>\n<p>Van der Breggen continued to apply pressure when needed, keeping the peloton at bay, and whittling the front group. After another massive pull at the start of the fourth and final lap with 23km to go, van der Breggen dispatched more riders including sprinters Kool and Consonni. </p>\n<p>With 14 kilometres to go, the front group was down to Van der Breggen, Gerritse, Gillespie, Andersen, Pieterse, Truyen and Van der Duin. Both Pieterse and Van der Duin made attacks in the final kilometres but were not able to get a separation leading to the small group sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9181&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9181&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Many races are held in the province of Antwerp with others being held across Belgium. The way that the general classification was calculated was changed from a points system to using the riders&#8217; finishing times of each race (like a road racing stage race) with time &#8216;bonuses&#8217; also available at an intermediate &#8216;sprint&#8217; at the end of the first lap with 15, 10 and 5 seconds being awarded. The maximum time a rider can lose in the general classification is 5 minutes, excluding the bonus seconds. When a rider does not finish or does not start, they are handed a 5-minute time loss, excluding bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>In a battle of Crelan-Corendon teammates, Sara Casasola saved a last explosive move for the final straightaway and edged Marion Norbert-Riberolle by one second at X2O Trofee Brussels &#8211; Brussels Universities Cyclocross. Lucinda Brand (Baloise Glowi) finished 39 seconds back in third.</p>\n<p>Casasola scored her first victory of the season, which was a redemptive ride from a close second-place to Brand on Saturday at the final Exact Cross contest in Sint-Niklaas. </p>\n<p>Earlier in the season Brand had already locked up the X2O Trophee series overall, so did not need the win Sunday at Brussels Universities Cyclocross. For the Italian winner, she locked up third overall in the eighth and final race of the X20 series.</p>\n<p>Dutch riders Denise Betsema (Pauwels Sauzen-Cibel Clementines) and Annemarie Worst (Seven Racing) completed the top five on Sunday, with Worst crashing early in the race and chasing all day. She held on for second overall in the series.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Exact Cross contest on Saturday, Casasola tagged along with teammate Inge van der Heijden at the front of the race. </p>\n<p>Eventually, Belgian champion Norbert-Riberolle made her way to the front with her teammates, but Van der Heijden then suffered a flat tyre and lost valuable time she could never recover, which resulted in the two-rider sprint taken by Casasola.</p>\n<p>Casasola competed in five rounds of X2O Trophee this season, earning a trio of bronze placings and then sealed her season with the victory on Sunday. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15101&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15101&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It&#8217;s my first race with the team and winning is always a very nice feeling,&#8221; Vollering said.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a little concern about today&#8217;s stage because there was a big breakaway. It was nice for us to have Nina Buijsman in the move and we really hoped it stayed away so she could take the win. But Visma were really keen to bring them back and that&#8217;s what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA breakaway of nine riders eventually formed on the mid-stage Alto de Collao climb, forcing FDJ-Suez and the sprinters&#8217; teams to lead the chase for the final two hours. </p>\n<p>Amongst them were danger riders such as Bredewold, Spratt, Lore De Schepper, Buijsman and Aalerud. At one point, the nine riders had a lead of two and a half minute lead and seemed set to stay away and fight for the stag victory. </p>\n<p>However after the climb the best sprinters rejoined the peloton with their teammates and a pursuit match began on the fast road to Alicante.  The gap was still close a minute with 10km to go but Visma-Lease a Bike and other teams upped the speed. </p>\n<p>The catch came inside the final kilometre after a late tunnel. Movistar managed to lead out the sprint but Balsamo made sure she was on the wheels and then took the best line to the finish and produced another unbeatable burst of speed to win a second consecutive stage.   </p>\n<p>Vollering finished safely in the peloton and was able to celebrate with her new FDJ-Suez teammates. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of six season-long competitions. In contrary to the other competitions, the Ethias Cross does not award points or compose an overall ranking, but rather consists of separate races. Sponsored by the Belgian hardware chain Brico for the first three seasons and then by the Belgian insurance company Ethias from 2019 to 2022, its main sponsor is the enterprise software provider Exact.</p>\n<p>Lucinda Brand (Baloise Glowi) won the final round of the Exact Cross series in Sint-Niklaas on Saturday. She battled for all five laps against Sara Casasola (Crelan-Corendon) and made her winning pass in the signature sand section just before the finish line of Waaslandcross, leaving the Italian with four seconds back in second place.</p>\n<p>Crelan-Corendon pitted two riders against Brand, with Casasola&#8217;s teammate Inge van der Heijden fading late in the contest and taking third, 34 seconds back, with time to spare to the Belgian chasers Julie Brouwers (Charles Li√©geois Roastery CX) in fourth and Marion Norbert Riberolle (Crelan-Corendon) in fifth.</p>\n<p>The seventh round of the regional series was held in northern Belgium on a cold, clear day, bright sunshine bouncing off the wide Waasland sand sections along the lake. Brand, who competed in only two rounds of Exact Cross, won Saturday&#8217;s contest for a fourth time in her career, now tied Sanne Cant with the most victories at the event.</p>\n<p>For Brand, it was her 10th victory of the cyclocross season, where she swept titles at the World Cup, Superprestige and X2O Badkamers Trofee series for a third time in her career. She only raced two of the Exact Cross events, going third at the opener in Beringen and then winning the finale at Sint-Niklaas.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every victory is different, you cannot compare victories with each other. But I am extremely happy that I was able to win ten times this season,&#8221; Brand told Het Nieuwsblad. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The legs didn&#8217;t feel so fresh anymore, but that&#8217;s probably logical at the end of the season. I was happy that the pace dropped off a bit now and then.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brand removed quickly around Inge Van Der Heijden to the front in order to avoid the massive swarm up the first of several large runups. On lap two, Casasola attacked and the Italian took a five-second lead on Brand and Van der Heijden. However, a fall by Casasola on the slippery off-camber corner allowed Brand to rejoin and two matched pedal strokes for most of the next three laps.</p>\n<p>Brand threw the hammer down through the wide sand section on the final lap, gaining a handful of seconds with a decisive pass of the Italian. Brand held her momentum in the final corners and hit the straightaway to the finish for a four-second margin, scoring her 10th victory of the cyclocross season. </p>\n<p>Casasola went four-for-four with podiums at Exact Cross races this season, while her teammate Van der Heijden scored four podiums in five starts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I tried to attack several times, but that wasn&#8217;t enough,&#8221; Casasola told Sporza at the finish. &#8220;Could I have done anything differently in the final round? I don&#8217;t think so, because I was at my limit and Lucinda was very strong.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15130&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15130&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Then me, Anna [Henderson], and Spratty [Amanda Spratt], were in the first group. The girls did a really great job trying to close the gap on the breakaway. </p>\n<p>&#8220;In the final I was just trying to jump on the wheels. I was a little bit scared to be stuck again, like yesterday, but I did a good sprint, so I&#8217;m really happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nThe 118km stage offered another hard day in the saddle and in the Valencia hills, with the 5.6km long Puerto de L‚ÄôOronet climb coming after 87km. </p>\n<p>Australia&#8217;s Emily Watts (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93) was the first to attack and was joined by Juliana Londo√±o (Picnic PostNL), who was keen to show her new Colombian national champion&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>They opened a lead of a minute but Watts then struggled on the Port de l&#8217;Oronet. Nikola Noskov√° (Cofidis) jumped across and was joined by five others, including Vollering but the second category climb failed to shake-up the overall classification. </p>\n<p>Amber Kraak (FDJ-SUEZ), Mireia Benito (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Maeva Squiban (UAE Team ADQ) got away on the descent as the peloton regrouped and protected key riders like Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Her Lidl-Trek teammates took up the chase on the gradual descent and flat roads to Valencia. The trio managed to hold a gap of 10-15 seconds into the last five kilometres but then SD Worx-Protime and Liv-AlUla-Jayco helped with the chase and the select peloton came back together with 1.5km to race. </p>\n<p>Balsamo made sure she was well-placed and then led out the sprint on the rising road to the line.  </p>\n<p>Vollering starts Sunday&#8217;s final stage in control of the orange leader&#8217;s jersey.

This group of riders had never ridden together before. Then it is extra nice that we take a victory so quickly. I am grateful to them. We were left with three riders. A real lead-out would have cost too much energy. Our plan was that I was dropped in Elisa Balsamo&#8217;s wheel and Anna van der Breggen and Steffi H√§berlin did that perfectly. At 700 metres from the finish, I made a last-minute decision to switch to FDJ&#8217;s train. That turned out to be the right choice and I get a lot of confidence from that,&#8221; Bredewold said of the final few hundred metres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of this decision. Sprinting in this way is still new for me. It was chaotic and I was looking for my own way. I knew my sprint values were good, but it&#8217;s not just about how many watts you pedal. You have to achieve a result together with your teammates, trust in each other and make the right choices. I managed to stay calm. That is sometimes a working point, so I am happy that I managed to do that today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We came here at the start with the climbers&#8217; group. That we managed to win a bunch sprint together is extra nice. It&#8217;s a relief to have that first win in my pocket so early in the season. A similar situation could present itself tomorrow. Just because I beat Elisa Balsamo because of how the sprint unfolded doesn&#8217;t mean I can do it again tomorrow. If it comes to a sprint again, I will go for it full force. But with Anna van der Breggen, we are also well-placed in the general classification. So we can play with a number of cards.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe second day of racing at the Setmana Ciclista Volta Femenina de la Comunitat Valenciana was another hilly 134km course from Benic√†ssim to Nules.</p>\n<p>There were two back-to-back climbs just after the halfway point: Alto Les Coronetes (8.1km at 4.4%). and Alto de Salt del Cavall (5.3km at 3.7%).</p>\n<p>Eva van Agt (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) broke away from the field just before the intermediate sprint at La Barona, with Chapman taking the points and bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>But as the pair reached the slopes of Alto Les Coronetes, Van Agt struggled to hold Chapman&#8217;s pace. The Australian opened a gap over the top and increased her solo lead to over a minute, as Van Agt was swallowed up by the chasing peloton led by FDJ-SUEZ.</p>\n<p>Chapman continued to push on alone and maintained her gap over the second and final climb of the day, Alto de Salt del Cavall. Over the top and along the sweeping descent, Chapman&#8217;s gap dropped slightly to just under a minute with 40km to go.</p>\n<p>Although FDJ-SUEZ were prominent at the front of the field and setting a quick pace to protect their overall race leader, Vollering, other teams like Fenix-Deceuninck and Movistar also moved to the front to help reduce the gap.</p>\n<p>However, inside the undulating route toward Nules, Chapman used her time-trialling strengths to her advantage and built her lead back out to 1:30.</p>\n<p>As the roads flattened out and the speed of the peloton increased inside the final 10km, the anticipation of a reduced group sprint in the air, Chapman&#8217;s gap was slashed to just 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>Chapman&#8217;s efforts came to an end with 4km remaining, as the teams with powerful sprinters left in the small field set up for the final kick.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek and Liv-AlUla-Jayco were the first to lead the field into the final stretch of road until Uno-X Mobility took over in the last kilometre.</p>\n<p>As the reduced group barrelled into the final few hundred metres, a perfectly positioned Bredewold launched her sprint off the wheel of Lippert and crossed the line with the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9189&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Many races are held in the province of Antwerp with others being held across Belgium. The way that the general classification was calculated was changed from a points system to using the riders&#8217; finishing times of each race (like a road racing stage race) with time &#8216;bonuses&#8217; also available at an intermediate &#8216;sprint&#8217; at the end of the first lap with 15, 10 and 5 seconds being awarded. The maximum time a rider can lose in the general classification is 5 minutes, excluding the bonus seconds. When a rider does not finish or does not start, they are handed a 5-minute time loss, excluding bonus seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15083&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15083&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE ADQ) moved into the overall lead of the UAE Tour Women with a dominant win on stage three.</p>\n<p>The Italian made her attack 3.2km from the finish at the top of the Jebel Hafeet climb, and soloed all the way to the line to claim her first win for her new team for 2025, UAE ADQ. </p>\n<p>Better yet, her teammate Silvia Persico sealed a one-two for UAE ADQ by winning the sprint for second from a case group of five that arrived 36 seconds later, ahead of Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla-Jayco), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM) and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health). </p>\n<p>Borghini inherits the overall lead from winner of the first two stages, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx &#8211; Protime), who was dropped much earlier on the climb. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe can really call it a masterpiece from Team ADQ,‚Äù proclaimed Borghini at the finish. ‚ÄúToday we had a clear goal, and it was the victory and the red jersey. All the team did amazing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Having put herself in a strong position by getting herself in the front echelon of yesterday‚Äôs crosswind-affected stage, Borghini was hot favourite to take the overall lead today. The main hazard was the potential for more action in crosswinds again during the early phase of the stage prior to the final climb, but her team remained attentive when there were some brief splits in the wind. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere was a moment when Siliva [Persico] and I were caught out of the main echelon,‚Äù she explained. ‚Äú[Elynor] B√§ckstedt brought us back within a second. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen the whole team did a great job to position us in the best position possible into the climb. After that, Persico just rode at a good tempo.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace on the Jebel Hafeet was enough to thin the group of favourites down to just nine riders, distancing overall leader Lorena Wiebes and GC rivals Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ) and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike). </p>\n<p>5.5km from the top, Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) made an attack, with Borghini the only rider to follow. The move was short-lived, however, as the rest of the 9-woman group rejoined shortly after ‚Äî including Persico, who resumed her pace-setting at the front.</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace continued to cause damage, with Garc√≠a, Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) and Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), the next to be dropped, leaving her and Borghini with just Niedermaier, Malcotti, Trinca Colonel and Le Court for company. </p>\n<p>Then with 3.2km to go Borghini made her attack, to which none of the others had any answer to.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt very comfortable the whole climb. When I felt like it was the right time, I just attacked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis was a crazy day. I really wanted to win my first victory for the team. I wanted us to win because a few weeks ago my family lost a friend, and that‚Äôs for him. We are pretty happy with the entire performance from Team UAE ADQ.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With only one stage left and a 2-09 lead on GC over her teammate Persico in second and 2-11 over Le Court in third, Borghini should be able to seal overall victory tomorrow. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor sure, we want to win this Tour and try to defend the red jersey until the very end of the race. It‚Äôs going to be a nice day tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage three of the UAE Tour was the only mountain stage of the race, and therefore the 10.7km finishing climb to Jebel Hafeet was expected to be the definitive moment in the GC race.</p>\n<p>This climb was not the only obstacle of the day, however, as the riders once more ventured far into the desert to face the kind of exposed roads that could host havoc if the wind blew.</p>\n<p>At the start of the day, it took a long time for a break to go. In fact, the peloton was still together by the time of the first intermediate sprint of the day 45km into the stage, meaning the GC contenders fought for the bonus seconds on offer. Borghini missed out in fourth, but her teammate Lara Gillespie did prevent Juliette Labous and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot from taking the maximum. </p>\n<p>The lull after that sprint allowed three riders to get up the road: Hannah Ludwig (Cofidis), Petra Zsank√≥ (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Nora Jenƒçu≈°ov√° (BePink &#8211; Imatra &#8211; Bongioanni), Before long, they had established themselves as the break of the day, and built a lead of around three minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that gap began to fall 90km from the finish as the pace in the peloton increased significantly in anticipation of potential crosswinds. The gaps were made at the back of the peloton rather than from out the front, and none of the top GC contenders were caught out, but the action was enough to see the three riders caught 78km from the finish.</p>\n<p>After another lull lasting about 10km, things kicked off again 67km from the finish, as a group of a dozen riders used the wind to go off the front of the peloton. Just like yesterday, Borghini, Wiebes and Lily Williams (Human Powered Health) made the split, along with big names Ferrand Prevot, Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Things did calm down again, however, and they were brought back 55km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Capitalising on the slow-down that followed, Cofidis initiated a new attack 27km from the finish, with their duo of Victoire Berteau and Amalie Dideriksen going clear with Marta Lach (Team SD Worx &#8211; Protime).</p>\n<p>However, with such a stern test to come in the shape of the Jebel Hafeet, this attack was always likely to be short-lived, and they were all brought back once the elite climbers came to the fore on its uphill slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE ADQ) moved into the overall lead of the UAE Tour Women with a dominant win on stage three.</p>\n<p>The Italian made her attack 3.2km from the finish at the top of the Jebel Hafeet climb, and soloed all the way to the line to claim her first win for her new team for 2025, UAE ADQ. </p>\n<p>Better yet, her teammate Silvia Persico sealed a one-two for UAE ADQ by winning the sprint for second from a case group of five that arrived 36 seconds later, ahead of Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla-Jayco), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM) and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health). </p>\n<p>Borghini inherits the overall lead from winner of the first two stages, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx &#8211; Protime), who was dropped much earlier on the climb. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe can really call it a masterpiece from Team ADQ,‚Äù proclaimed Borghini at the finish. ‚ÄúToday we had a clear goal, and it was the victory and the red jersey. All the team did amazing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Having put herself in a strong position by getting herself in the front echelon of yesterday‚Äôs crosswind-affected stage, Borghini was hot favourite to take the overall lead today. The main hazard was the potential for more action in crosswinds again during the early phase of the stage prior to the final climb, but her team remained attentive when there were some brief splits in the wind. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere was a moment when Siliva [Persico] and I were caught out of the main echelon,‚Äù she explained. ‚Äú[Elynor] B√§ckstedt brought us back within a second. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen the whole team did a great job to position us in the best position possible into the climb. After that, Persico just rode at a good tempo.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace on the Jebel Hafeet was enough to thin the group of favourites down to just nine riders, distancing overall leader Lorena Wiebes and GC rivals Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ) and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike). </p>\n<p>5.5km from the top, Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) made an attack, with Borghini the only rider to follow. The move was short-lived, however, as the rest of the 9-woman group rejoined shortly after ‚Äî including Persico, who resumed her pace-setting at the front.</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace continued to cause damage, with Garc√≠a, Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) and Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), the next to be dropped, leaving her and Borghini with just Niedermaier, Malcotti, Trinca Colonel and Le Court for company. </p>\n<p>Then with 3.2km to go Borghini made her attack, to which none of the others had any answer to.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt very comfortable the whole climb. When I felt like it was the right time, I just attacked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis was a crazy day. I really wanted to win my first victory for the team. I wanted us to win because a few weeks ago my family lost a friend, and that‚Äôs for him. We are pretty happy with the entire performance from Team UAE ADQ.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With only one stage left and a 2-09 lead on GC over her teammate Persico in second and 2-11 over Le Court in third, Borghini should be able to seal overall victory tomorrow. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor sure, we want to win this Tour and try to defend the red jersey until the very end of the race. It‚Äôs going to be a nice day tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage three of the UAE Tour was the only mountain stage of the race, and therefore the 10.7km finishing climb to Jebel Hafeet was expected to be the definitive moment in the GC race.</p>\n<p>This climb was not the only obstacle of the day, however, as the riders once more ventured far into the desert to face the kind of exposed roads that could host havoc if the wind blew.</p>\n<p>At the start of the day, it took a long time for a break to go. In fact, the peloton was still together by the time of the first intermediate sprint of the day 45km into the stage, meaning the GC contenders fought for the bonus seconds on offer. Borghini missed out in fourth, but her teammate Lara Gillespie did prevent Juliette Labous and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot from taking the maximum. </p>\n<p>The lull after that sprint allowed three riders to get up the road: Hannah Ludwig (Cofidis), Petra Zsank√≥ (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Nora Jenƒçu≈°ov√° (BePink &#8211; Imatra &#8211; Bongioanni), Before long, they had established themselves as the break of the day, and built a lead of around three minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that gap began to fall 90km from the finish as the pace in the peloton increased significantly in anticipation of potential crosswinds. The gaps were made at the back of the peloton rather than from out the front, and none of the top GC contenders were caught out, but the action was enough to see the three riders caught 78km from the finish.</p>\n<p>After another lull lasting about 10km, things kicked off again 67km from the finish, as a group of a dozen riders used the wind to go off the front of the peloton. Just like yesterday, Borghini, Wiebes and Lily Williams (Human Powered Health) made the split, along with big names Ferrand Prevot, Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Things did calm down again, however, and they were brought back 55km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Capitalising on the slow-down that followed, Cofidis initiated a new attack 27km from the finish, with their duo of Victoire Berteau and Amalie Dideriksen going clear with Marta Lach (Team SD Worx &#8211; Protime).</p>\n<p>However, with such a stern test to come in the shape of the Jebel Hafeet, this attack was always likely to be short-lived, and they were all brought back once the elite climbers came to the fore on its uphill slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Ultimately, her alert move to latch onto the group at the very start of the day just as a gap was about to open helped secure her victory. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn‚Äôt expect that,&#8221; she reflected at the finish, &#8220;especially as for a long time the peloton was really close to us. I think I was one of the last ones who could jump over to this group at the beginning. In the headwind part, we got a minute, and we kept on going.

It‚Äôs going to be hard for anyone to stop Longo Borghini, now that she has gained so much time on all of her rivals. </p>\n<p>As for the likes of Ashleigh Moolman (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco), who arrived in a group behind the main peloton, their hopes of winning the GC are now surely over. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the wind blowing strongly, the riders almost sprinted out of the neutralised zone at the beginning of this 111km trek through the desert, from Al Dhafra Fort to Al Mirfa. </p>\n<p>Wiebes, Borghini, Swinkels, Gillespie and Williams pulled clear within the first few kilometres, igniting a breathless chase between themselves and the peloton.</p>\n<p>Their lead remained steady at over a handful of seconds, very clearly in the sight of the peloton on the long straight roads. As the wind continued to blow, the peloton split into various groups, with two large groups forming behind the main peloton.</p>\n<p>With 98km to go the first trailing group rejoined the peloton, and 8km later the other trailing group also managed to rejoin.</p>\n<p>At this point the quintet ahead still had a lead of less than 30 seconds, but the coming together of the groups behind, and a change of direction into a headwind, seemed to take the wind out of the sails of the chase.

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) claimed victory in the first stage of the 2025 UAE Tour Women.</p>\n<p>Having been led out perfectly by her teammates, she took part in a drag race against her rival and Dutch compatriot Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL) but was comfortably the quickest. </p>\n<p>Kool had to settle for second, while Nienke Veenhoven (Visma-Lease a Bike) was third. </p>\n<p>The result means Wiebes will swap her European Champions‚Äô jersey for the red jersey, as the overall leader of the race.</p>\n<p>Wiebes opened her account in just her first race of the 2025 season, just as she did here last year at the same finish at Dubai Harbour. </p>\n<p>Whereas Kool was forced to start her sprint early, running out of teammates on the finishing straight, Wiebes was guided into position by lead-out riders Marta Lach and Barbara Guarischi, who took control of the peloton from Human Powered Health following the crucial final corner inside the last kilometre. </p>\n<p>The pair were side by side with a few hundred metres left, but Wiebes had fresher legs and a faster kick, ending up with a comfortable winning margin on the line. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The feeling is really good,&#8221; said a smiling Wiebes at the finish. &#8220;I think it was really a fair sprint. We were both [her and Kool] fully in the wind. I‚Äôm happy that my sprint is still at a high level. But there are still two stages to come, so I need to keep going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the team did a really good job to put us into position. It was chaotic, as expected. But we went well into the next corner, and then Marta and Barbara did a good job to do the lead out and drop me off at a good point. Charlotte [Kool] came at speed from the back, so first I had to catch her a bit back. I felt strong all the way to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nMany of the leading riders in the world assembled in the Middle East for the third leg of the 2025 Women‚Äôs World Tour. Today was the first of four stages of the UAE Tour, and, taking place over flat roads, was anticipated to be a day for the sprinters. </p>\n<p>Crosswinds could have complicated that, given the exposed nature of the wide open desert roads, but conditions were calm and the peloton remained together. </p>\n<p>Setting off from Dubai‚Äôs police officers club, Linda Laporta (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni) was the first rider to make a move as she set off on a solo attack. Sylvie Swinkels (Roland) and Cristina Tonetti (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) formed a chasing duo behind but did not manage to catch her prior to the first intermediate sprint of the day situated 32km into the stage, allowing Laporta to take maximum points.</p>\n<p>Those three riders eventually came together, and a relaxed chase in the peloton allowed them to gain a lead that exceeded eight minutes at its height. </p>\n<p>That left the break to contest the second intermediate sprint, 66km from the finish. This time Tonetti took the spoils, coming round Swinkels before the line after Tonetti had been caught and passed following an early attack. </p>\n<p>It was on the approach to this intermediate sprint that the peloton began to chase in earnest, with SD Worx-Protime among the teams to move to the front.

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) claimed victory in the first stage of the 2025 UAE Tour Women.</p>\n<p>Having been led out perfectly by her teammates, she took part in a drag race against her rival and Dutch compatriot Charlotte Kool (Picnic PostNL) but was comfortably the quickest. </p>\n<p>Kool had to settle for second, while Nienke Veenhoven (Visma-Lease a Bike) was third. </p>\n<p>The result means Wiebes will swap her European Champions‚Äô jersey for the red jersey, as the overall leader of the race.</p>\n<p>Wiebes opened her account in just her first race of the 2025 season, just as she did here last year at the same finish at Dubai Harbour. </p>\n<p>Whereas Kool was forced to start her sprint early, running out of teammates on the finishing straight, Wiebes was guided into position by lead-out riders Marta Lach and Barbara Guarischi, who took control of the peloton from Human Powered Health following the crucial final corner inside the last kilometre. </p>\n<p>The pair were side by side with a few hundred metres left, but Wiebes had fresher legs and a faster kick, ending up with a comfortable winning margin on the line. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The feeling is really good,&#8221; said a smiling Wiebes at the finish. &#8220;I think it was really a fair sprint. We were both [her and Kool] fully in the wind. I‚Äôm happy that my sprint is still at a high level. But there are still two stages to come, so I need to keep going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the team did a really good job to put us into position. It was chaotic, as expected. But we went well into the next corner, and then Marta and Barbara did a good job to do the lead out and drop me off at a good point. Charlotte [Kool] came at speed from the back, so first I had to catch her a bit back. I felt strong all the way to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nMany of the leading riders in the world assembled in the Middle East for the third leg of the 2025 Women‚Äôs World Tour. Today was the first of four stages of the UAE Tour, and, taking place over flat roads, was anticipated to be a day for the sprinters. </p>\n<p>Crosswinds could have complicated that, given the exposed nature of the wide open desert roads, but conditions were calm and the peloton remained together. </p>\n<p>Setting off from Dubai‚Äôs police officers club, Linda Laporta (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni) was the first rider to make a move as she set off on a solo attack. Sylvie Swinkels (Roland) and Cristina Tonetti (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) formed a chasing duo behind but did not manage to catch her prior to the first intermediate sprint of the day situated 32km into the stage, allowing Laporta to take maximum points.</p>\n<p>Those three riders eventually came together, and a relaxed chase in the peloton allowed them to gain a lead that exceeded eight minutes at its height. </p>\n<p>That left the break to contest the second intermediate sprint, 66km from the finish. This time Tonetti took the spoils, coming round Swinkels before the line after Tonetti had been caught and passed following an early attack. </p>\n<p>It was on the approach to this intermediate sprint that the peloton began to chase in earnest, with SD Worx-Protime among the teams to move to the front. Their work saw the gap between them and the leading trio plummet rapidly, from over seven minutes about 70km from the finish, to a mere 1-30 at 50km to go.</p>\n<p>With 52km to go, there was a large high-speed crash towards the front of the peloton, with over 20 riders going down. Among those to fall were Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco), Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek) and Ashleigh Moolman (AG Insurance-Soudal), although nobody appeared too badly hurt.

It is one of six season-long competitions. In contrary to the other competitions, the Ethias Cross does not award points or compose an overall ranking, but rather consists of separate races. Sponsored by the Belgian hardware chain Brico for the first three seasons and then by the Belgian insurance company Ethias from 2019 to 2022, its main sponsor is the enterprise software provider Exact.</p>\n<p>Marie Schreiber (Team SD Worx-Protime) glided through the slippery mud at Parkcross a mid-week C2 contest in Maldegem and won the penultimate round of the Exact Cross series.</p>\n<p>Crelan-Corendon teammates Inge van der Heijden and Sara Casasola rounded out the podium, the Dutch rider 16 seconds back and the Italian another five seconds later. </p>\n<p>The drama of the race unfolded well behind the podium finishers when Belgian Jinse Peeters (De Ceuster-Bouwpunt) and Dutchwoman Manon Bakker (Crelan-Corendon) were disqualified after bumping in a corner and hitting each other. </p>\n<p>On the sixth of the seven laps, Peeters held the inside position as three riders approached a 90-degree left-hand corner. Bakker moved beside Peeters to make a pass, and the Belgian used her right arm to push Bakker away from close proximity. </p>\n<p>The shove caused the Dutch rider to unclip to keep from crashing, with Bakker then slapping Peeters on the shoulder while she tried to regain control, but lost position in the small group. </p>\n<p>Peeters thought Bakker had made a dangerous move to impede her process. Race officials reviewed the footage at the end of the race and deemed both riders would be penalised, resulting in DQs.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the 21-year-old Schreiber celebrated her sixth elite cyclocross victory for the season, including a third Luxembourg national championship in January. In Li√©vin at the World Championships last weekend she landed on the podium for the first time, earning the silver medal in the U23 division. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt the strongest, it‚Äôs nice to finish the season with a victory,&#8221; said Schreiber, who will now take time off before transitioning in April to the road for SD Worx-Protime. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The two riders from Corelan-Corendon tried to play the team game to beat me. It was important to stay calm in such a tactical situation. They took turns attacking. But I was not on the limit in their wheel. </p>\n<p>&#8220;On the penultimate lap, I placed my acceleration and went full out. This was my last race of the season. So I planned to ride myself completely empty and keep going until the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17196&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17196&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

However, after changing onto a bike with lower tyre pressure, she charged through the mud and pulled out a sizeable advantage.</p>\n<p>After recovering from a heavy crash last weekend Schreiber provided the challenge for the British star. However, a series of errors on one technical section cost her, and she was distanced in second place.</p>\n<p>The race was not over, though, and a slip on the final lap by B√§ckstedt allowed her opponent to come fighting back within 16 seconds. However, B√§ckstedt was not to be denied and powered through the final gap to take victory 39 seconds ahead of Schreiber.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bentveld finished in bronze after battling past quick starter C√©lia Gery (France).</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt hasn‚Äôt been the smoothest of seasons, but the last few races boosted my confidence,‚Äù said Backstedt. ‚ÄúComing into this one, I had the fire for it. I‚Äôm happy to come out on top.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe first lap wasn‚Äôt so smooth for me &#8230; a little bit of panic in the end. It was completely opposite conditions to the recon and just adrenaline from the start of the world championships. I slipped on one of the corners and wiped out, so I was further behind. I managed to reset myself and come back to the front.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI wanted to drop the tyre pressure a little bit to see what it was like; I thought it would help. Once that happened and I was on that lower pressure I felt a lot more comfortable.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a challenging course, different to what I thought it would be like, and it was a lot more slippery, even the flat corners; it was super-easy to wipe out in places. I was still having to push all the way to the line, and it made for an interesting race.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA total of 45 riders from 19 nations battled it out for under-23 women‚Äôs honours.</p>\n<p>Defending champion B√§ckstedt came into the event as the firm favourite after sealing the under-23 World Cup overall last weekend.</p>\n<p>The 2.8-kilometre course snaked around parkland and included short but steep climbs and technical off-camber descents. Freezing temperatures overnight in Li√©vin meant that the course was still firm but softening quickly as riders took the start line.</p>\n<p>A mistake from challenger Schreiber away from the start saw the Luxembourg national champion miss her pedal and shuffle back in the pack.</p>\n<p>Sprinting away up the tarmac start it was pre-race favourite B√§ckstedt who led the bunch through the opening sections.</p>\n<p>Despite her early mistake, Schreiber showed her speed through the opening corners and then sprinted away at the front.</p>\n<p>French home favourite Gery was able to follow Schreiber as B√§ckstedt crashed and was pushed back to fourth, a few seconds back.</p>\n<p>Bentveld finished third in last year‚Äôs under-23 World Championships and was also at the front in the opening exchanges. Meanwhile, European champion Gery was thriving with the home support in the opening lap as the leading group of four distanced their competitors.</p>\n<p>While her challengers took a bike change B√§ckstedt opened a gap before sliding out at the bottom of a steep bank. After the opening lap B√§ckstedt, Gery and Schreiber had gapped Dutch rider Bentveld by nine seconds.</p>\n<p>B√§kstedt requested less pressure in her rear tyre following two first-lap crashes and had a bike change as the course was becoming more slippery. With her fresh bike, the defending world champion put the power down and opened up a gap on Gery and Schreiber, who was also struggling in the conditions.</p>\n<p>Following her first lap exploits Gery started to suffer as she, Schreiber and Bentveld were each separated by a handful of seconds. Gery was the next competitor to make a small error and Schreiber took advantage to move into silver position.</p>\n<p>At the end of the second of five laps, B√§ckstedt was almost out of sight and led by 21 seconds from Schreiber, while Gery was taking on an energy gel as she sat just ahead of Bentveld.</p>\n<p>Bentveld took advantage of the fading Gery and joined her in the fight for the bronze medal position by the halfway distance.</p>\n<p>Schreiber was determined not to allow B√§ckstedt an easy ride and reduced the gap to 12 seconds at the end of lap three. Behind, Bentveld was looking behind to the position of Gerry who sat nine seconds further back in fourth going into the penultimate lap.</p>\n<p>However, the slippery section which tested Schreiber in the early stages again caused the Luxembourg champion to falter as the gap grew back out to 24 seconds behind B√§ckstedt.</p>\n<p>That mistake gave the Brit renewed optimism as she eased her pace through the technical sections and kept in control. Taking the last lap bell B√§ckstedt was out of sight on the uphill finish and  26 seconds ahead of Schreiber, with Bentveld a further 26 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>The same section which impacted Schreiber the previous lap caught out B√§ckstedt who fell to her knees and saw her gap cut to 16 seconds.</p>\n<p>As the course flowed and cut back on itself, the Brit was able to see the position of her rival as she defended first place and pulled her gap back out to 25 seconds.</p>\n<p>The CANYON//SRAM zondacrypto rider finally had time to celebrate a third cyclo-cross world title and her second at under-23 level in a row.</p>\n<p>Schreiber picked up her first world championships medal finishing 39 seconds behind in second. Meanwhile, Bentveld repeated her bronze medal performance from last season finishing 1:20 back from the winner.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14997&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14997&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Puck Pieterse rounded out the podium in third place for an all-Dutch podium.</p>\n<p>The much-awaited battle between the Dutch rivals transpired into an intriguing contest, which was decided in the final moments of the elite women&#8217;s six-lap race.</p>\n<p>Brand powered away while Van Empel was taking a bike change on the penultimate lap, which put Van Empel under severe pressure ahead of the closing lap of the race.</p>\n<p>However, 22-year-old Van Empel used her running speed and strength on the steep climbs to claw back on the final lap.</p>\n<p>The rivals went side-by-side and traded blows in the closing stages as they charged through the last technical sections.</p>\n<p>However, a mistake by Brand coming into the final tarmac finish gave Van Empel the advantage she required to take a slender victory.</p>\n<p>Completing an all-Dutch podium, Pieterse gave everything to challenge her other two rivals in the opening stages.</p>\n<p>However, from the midway point, Pieterse was distanced and was left struggling a dozen seconds behind her rivals before losing time in the closing stages to finish third 1:09 behind.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Van Empel was able to ride a finishing mud mound as Brand stalled to force her winning margin. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise that I‚Äôd won the race [coming into the tarmac finish] because I needed to go really deep,‚Äù said Van Empel.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMentally, it was quite hard after last weekend [two results off the podium]; this is quite emotional. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Lucinda (Brand) was a great competitor today, respect to her, she rode a very good season.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for her as well for her podium finish and Puck coming in third place, we [the Netherlands] did a very good job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van Empel also noted the changing weather and course conditions in the days leading up to the race, which made for unpredictable racing.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIn the last few days, the course changed every day, and it was difficult as it changed after the recon this morning. It‚Äôs always tricky in the race to see how the course is, but after a few laps, you know the course well, and you need to find some points where you are better than the rest. I expected before the race that it might be a hard battle, and it was.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe elite women‚Äôs race was billed as the showcase on Saturday at the Cyclo-cross World Championship and potentially the most open race of the weekend.</p>\n<p>Weaknesses have been found in defending champion Van Empel‚Äôs armoury this season, with the Dutch youngster winning 10 of 19 outings coming into the event.</p>\n<p>A small field for the elite women‚Äôs event saw 35 entries from 12 nations, with the Netherlands represented by nine competitors.</p>\n<p>However, one rider who was missing from the start line was eight-time World Champion  Marianne Vos who pulled out due to a calf injury sustained last weekend in Maasmechelen World Cup.</p>\n<p>The small mining town of Li√©vin in northern France hosted the world championship event over a three-kilometre course, which included a combination of steep banks, technical off-camber and grassland.</p>\n<p>A sea of Dutch jersey dominated the front row of the starting grid but it was French rider Amandine Fouquenet, who powered around the outside to lead into the first corners.</p>\n<p>Dutch riders Pieterse and Van Empel were in close proximity as the field ebbed through the opening sections.</p>\n<p>Pieterse won the Dutch National title last month and took the lead going into the opening technical off-camber as Fouquenet fell back after her starting effort.</p>\n<p>Van Empel was keen to put her mark on the event and powered past Pieterse after the first climb, and the pair quickly had a gap of 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>After winning the World Cup event in Maasmechelen last weekend, Blanka Kata Vas was keen not to allow the leading pair to ride away, and she chased along with the experienced Brand.</p>\n<p>By the conclusion of the opening lap, the leading pair had established a gap of nine seconds over a lone chasing Brand and Vas was a further five seconds back.</p>\n<p>After failing to ride away at the front on the opening lap, Van Empel stopped her charge on the second lap and Brand closed to form a leading trio.</p>\n<p>As both of her rivals took bike changes Brand took advantage and led for the first time, as the Dutch trio started trading blows.</p>\n<p>Pieterse was next to attack through a final muddy section of the lap and pulled out a slender advantage as Van Empel struggled to get mud and stones out of her pedals.</p>\n<p>The European champion was forced to change bikes and lost a handful of seconds on Pieterse and Brand.</p>\n<p>After being put onto the back foot on the third lap Van Empel showed her strength as she again powered up the lap‚Äôs steep bank to regain the lead.</p>\n<p>Brand sensed a weakness in her rivals, and while rival Van Empel responded, Pieterse was gapped and fell four seconds behind following a bike change.</p>\n<p>After following the mid-race attack of her rival Van Empel hit back at Brand and forced a slender advantage.</p>\n<p>However, Van Empel was taking no risks, and Brand returned as her rival elected to run a technical section.</p>\n<p>Despite showing signs of tiredness, Pieterse was able to stay in contention with her Dutch opponents and was dangling at four seconds back.</p>\n<p>A fourth-lap bike change by Van Empel allowed World Cup overall winner Brand to pull out an advantage once again. However, the Visma-Lease a Bike rider was again equal to the challenge and quickly clawed her opponent back.</p>\n<p>The tactical games of Brand and Van Empel continued into the penultimate lap, and Pieterse sat 15 seconds back while Inge Van der Heijden battled her way into fourth.</p>\n<p>Van Empel was showing signs of struggling to clip into her pedals throughout the race but was losing no ground as the battle continued.</p>\n<p>A further bike change by Van Empel allowed Brand the slender advantage she required to gap her rival by a handful of seconds again.</p>\n<p>Brand threw everything at her rival with little over a lap remaining and pulled out a sizable gap. However, Van Empel sprinted up the finishing road climb and powered back to her opponent, as Pieterse fell to 36 seconds back.</p>\n<p>The defending world champion used her running speed and strength on a steep climb to pull back to her rival once again.</p>\n<p>The pair came into the final section together before Brand got caught on the final mud mound, and Van Empel sprinted up the tarmac finish for victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14996&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14996&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Czech rider then looked the stronger of the pair and celebrated at the end of lap four after thinking she had won the race.</p>\n<p>She was being brought back by Revol who maintained her strength over the steps and was more adept in the technical sectors, pushing Bukovsk√° down to second after making a small mistake which gave the French rider breathing space to celebrate at the finish.</p>\n<p>Rafaelle Carrier (Canada) won the closely fought battle for third place 1:43 behind the two leaders, beating junior European CX champion Anja Grossmann (Switzerland) to the final podium spot.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the mixed-relay got action underway on Friday at at Cyclo-cross Worlds, the junior women took centre stage on Saturday morning, with the 42 riders getting underway in frosty, cold conditions in Li√©vin. </p>\n<p>The French riders brought roars from the home crown with an aggressive start, as Revol and Lison Desprez took an early lead. Soon Revol showed herself as the strongest, leaving her compatriot and the whole field behind on the opening lap. </p>\n<p>Revol crossed the line at the of lap one with a 24-second lead on Carrier, who led a large chase group. </p>\n<p>The French rider looked to be riding away to solo victory until Bukovsk√° shot out of the chasers at the start of lap two and began to chip away at Revol&#8217;s advantage. Soon, the Czech rider had halved the deficit and was just 12 seconds down at the end of lap 2. </p>\n<p>Small mistakes from Revol allowed Bukovsk√° to make contact midway through the third lap, before the home nation finally lost the lead after 23-minutes of racing. </p>\n<p>A great battle ensued between the two 16-year-olds, with Revol fighting back towards the enf of lap 3 and almost retaking the lead before a mistake undid all of her good work. She was sent out of deep rut, almost crashing in the process, but did stay on two wheels despite losing time.</p>\n<p>Bukovsk√° took a ten-second lead into the fourth lap and defended it well until the final sector, where Revol&#8217;s technical advantage started to shine through and she make contact ahead of the final corner. </p>\n<p>The Czech rider then looked as though she was attacking but it turned out she thought it was the end of the race, celebrating at the line one lap too early before realising she had to continue. </p>\n<p>She refocused and did maintain her lead going into the final lap but had wasted a bullet, allowing Revol to slowly claw back the advantage and start a fierce shoulder-to-shoulder fight for the world title. </p>\n<p>Revol proved too strong after making contact and putting the pressure on her opponent. She looked to have it sewn up but the victory for France was confirmed when Bukovsk√° make a final mistake and got stuck in the mud, allowing Revol to celebrate emotionally at the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20618&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20618&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is held a few days before the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. It is rated as a 1.1 event on the UCI Oceania Tour. In 2024 the race was renamed as the Geelong Classic for Women and Surf Coast Classic for men.</p>\n<p>Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) claimed the first win of the season for her new team FDJ-Suez, charging across the line ahead of Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) with an assured sprint at the first edition of the women&#8217;s 1.1 ranked women&#8217;s Surf Coast Classic ‚Äì a 118km mid-week race to kick off the action before Saturday&#8217;s Women&#8217;s WorldTour event at the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. </p>\n<p>The rider from New Zealand had already made it obvious in South Australia that she had the form, winning the bunch sprint for second place on stage 1 of the Santos Tour Down Under.</p>\n<p>Wollaston, second at Hangar Point behind breakaway rider Daniek Hangeveld, just needed the opportunity to deliver when the top step was at stake and Wednesday turned out to be her day. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really, really strong today,&#8221; said Wollaston at the end of the race which started in Lorne with a long climb and then ended back on the coast at Torquay after looping inland.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last few races maybe I&#8217;ve struggled mentally, I think, to really stay present in the race and stay attentive and be confident enough that I&#8217;m good enough to be there in the final.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, as soon as I started climbing, I knew I had a good shot at the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was a clear-cut victory for Wollaston, ahead of Dygert but the battle for third was tight, with Georgia Baker (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) making it to the podium steps for a second time this week after having come second at the 1.Pro Schwalbe One Day Classic in Adelaide. The winner of that race, Clara Copponi (Lidl-Trek), was fourth this time.</p>\n<p>The two podiums perhaps mean all that much more to Baker given that they were an unexpected bonus considering the recovery process after being hit by a car in Spain in September. That left her grappling with a concussion that took a long time to recover from, so it was only in mid-November that she could start working her way back to fitness on the bike.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Getting back after my injury at the end of last year I thought my role would be as more of a domestique over the summer but these opportunities came up within the team and I&#8217;m just really happy to be on the podium,&#8221; said Baker, who added that the Australian squad had worked hard for her all day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really good sign for the team for the year ahead.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was still an echo of the summer holiday mood in the coastal town of Lorne which hosted the race start but it was straight into the hard work for the riders as they confronted a challenging course for the new 1.1-ranked addition to the calendar. </p>\n<p>The teams were getting ready to race with the beach just metres away, the red and yellow flags of the lifeguard-patrolled section flapped in the breeze in the background and the inquisitive cockatoos dropped by on the picnic tables where they were getting ready.</p>\n<p>The nearby water may have been the most popular spot in town when the riders rolled in from Adelaide on Monday to temperatures of around 40¬∞C, but that had almost halved for race day so the water was quiet but the roads weren‚Äôt. </p>\n<p>The race had barely rolled off the start line before heading straight into a challenging 10km climb as the peloton worked its way inland to Deans Marsh. There were several attacks on the climb, with UAE Team ADQ a regular on the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Still, more riders were going off the back than off the front. While no move stuck, the pressure was certainly on, causing a split in the peloton as it topped the climb, leaving many with a tough early chase.</p>\n<p>As the race headed through Deans Marsh with 96km to go there were many riders off behind ‚Äì some in touch with the convoy but others well behind. They included Canyon-SRAM zondacryprto‚Äôs Maike van der Duin and Tiffany Cromwell, Silvia Zanardi (Human Powered Health), and Maeve Plouffe (ARA Cycling).</p>\n<p>More attacks rolled and were caught and, with a little more than 70km of racing to go, there was another substantial split in the field, with 20 riders off the front. The next move was a solo effort with Julie van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) stretching out a gap that hit 30 seconds with around 55km to go.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, it was another of those fleeting breakaways, caught before the feed zone in the farmland alongside the Wurdiboluc Picnic Area with 43km of racing left.</p>\n<p>The peloton bunched, surged, and then bunched again several times as it started to head out of the hills and paddocks and drew ever closer to the coast. It didn‚Äôt deliver fierce enough crosswinds to really help substantially with any splits but that didn&#8217;t stop prevent the many heated battles.</p>\n<p>At nearly 10km, heading toward Bells Beach the group was still all together and while there were attempts to get away in the stretched-out run to the line, ultimately it all came down to a bunch sprint, with Wollaston put into position by her teammates while Dygert surfing the wheels after the team plan switched to her halfway through after sprinter Van der Duin got set back on the climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a good day and the finish, it was super ideal for me getting it strung out,&#8221; said Dygert of the run to the finish line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was kind of on my own there, so surfing a little bit, and I had to come the long way around but even sprinting against Ally, I think she still would have gotten me even if I had a perfect day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, the perfect day was all Wollaston&#8217;s.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24908&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24908&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The five races are ranked 1.1 on the UCI Europe Tour.</p>\n<p>Thalita De Jong (Human Powered Health) shot to victory in the final race of the Challenge Mallorca Femenina, the Trofeo Binissalem-Andratx, leaving behind C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) on the steep slopes of the Port d&#8217;Andratx.</p>\n<p>The Dutchwoman came from behind on the final climb of the 107.5km race after Kerbaol launched her bid for victory 1.5km out. De Jong came across 700 metres later before leaving the Frenchwoman behind with 400 to go.</p>\n<p>There was no answer to De Jong&#8217;s move, leaving the 31-year-old to celebrate the 11th win of her career. Kerbaol faded to third place the run to the line, with Silvia Persico (UAE Team ADQ) nipping past late on to score second place, 13 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Further back, Katrine Aalerud (Uno-X Mobility) secured fourth place at 21 seconds after her team had done much of the pacemaking on the lead-in to the climb. Mavi Garc√≠a (Spain) landed fifth place, 26 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Earlier on in the day, Garc√≠a had been the biggest victim as crosswinds split the peloton apart. She was in form having finished second in the Trofeo Palma on Sunday and was forced to chase back on.</p>\n<p>Up front, a strong group of around 20 riders formed, with top names including Trofeo Palma winner Marlen Reusser (Movistar) as well as the podium trio all making the cut. The group wouldn&#8217;t stick out front, though, and Garc√≠a wouldn&#8217;t stay out the rear, either. Just inside the 30km to go mark, everything was back together.</p>\n<p>The regrouping came in time for the major obstacles of the day in the shape of the late hills, including the Coll de sa Gramola and the closing climb in Andratx. A thinning group headed up the Gramola, with only around 25 at the front of the race.</p>\n<p>Claire Steels (Movistar) led the way over the top following attacks on the climb by Lily Williams (Human Powered Health) and Eleonora Gasparrini (UAE Team ADQ), while Kerbaol, Persico, and Garc√≠a tried to jump on the way down the descent.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol and Persico briefly went clear before they were brought back, at which point Uno-X Mobility took over the pacemaking on the road into the final climb. 10 seconds off the rear, Reusser and several Movistar teammates were working to chase back on, but they wouldn&#8217;t make it in time for the climb, leaving the front group to contest the win.</p>\n<p>On the 1.7km, 9.4% climb to the line, it was Uno-X Mobility who set up the action, but it was Kerbaol who attacked first. She hit out 200 metres into the test, immediately getting a gap on her rivals. Behind her, the group thinned out as the best climbers emerged.</p>\n<p>It was De Jong who proved the strongest of the chase, making a solo move to bridge across. She joined Kerbaol 800 metres from the line and immediately took to the front to set the pace. At 400 to go, Kerbaol had nothing left to give, and so it was De Jong who powered clear to score the victory.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol was metres away from hanging on to second place before a resurgent Persico sped past at the death to come through for second place, nipping the Frenchwoman by a solitary second at the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21984&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21984&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Pieterse was third at 39 seconds. </p>\n<p>Brand ended the World Cup series with a total of 350 points, beating Van Empel, who scored 276 points, and Vas scored 253 points. Brand has ridden 27 cyclocross races so far this winter and always finished in the top three, winning eight of them. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great way to finish the World Cup,&#8221; Brand said. &#8220;I felt OK on the first lap but it was not amazing. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Then we, Puck and I, came together. I felt good and thought we&#8217;d continue together and we&#8217;d see how the race ended. Then she made a mistake and I knew I had to take my chance and keep pushing.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Asked if she was feeling good for next weekend&#8217;s World Championships in France, Brand was succinct: &#8220;Exactly. Yes.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>France&#8217;s H√©l√®ne Clauzel (Van Rysel Racing Team) had the best start and led up the rising road and onto the grass and first descent. Van Empel and Pieterse also started well, while Brand had her typical slower start but soon joined them in a show of intention. </p>\n<p>Clauzel and everyone else were soon distanced by Brand, Van Empel and Pieterse in a show of ability and form. Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) was the first to take a tumble and soon climbed off to avoid worsening any injuries. Vos also crashed on Saturday in Maasmechelen, and finished a disappointing 13th.</p>\n<p>Brand took advantage of Pieterse&#8217;s sudden and surprising first fall on the first lap and rode away and opened a 20-second gap. </p>\n<p>Van Empel tried to close the gap but she also fell on the fourth lap. She got stuck in a rut, tried to ride across it and was thrown to the ground. It was the second crash in two days and the world champion seemed shocked despite riding on.  </p>\n<p>Vas was more consistent and more skilled. She moved up to second place but was 27 seconds down on Brand with a fifth and final lap to race. Pieterse and Van Empel were at 45 seconds.  </p>\n<p>Brand powered on and increased her lead to show she is also a favourite for next week&#8217;s World Championships. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17171&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17171&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It competes annually in January during the Australian racing campaign. The race is ranked 1. Pro.</p>\n<p>Clara Copponi (Lidl-Trek) won the Schwalbe Women&#8217;s One Day Classic on Sunday, carefully tucked away in the field until she unleashed the perfect sprint to claim victory in the new 1.Pro race run alongside the Tour Down Under in South Australia.</p>\n<p>Georgia Baker (Liv AlUla Jayco) came second after launching her powerful sprint 200 metres out while Rachele Barbieri (Picnic PostNL) took third in the bunch sprint even after having clipped off the front with Chloe Dygert ((Canyon-Sram zondacrypto) in a late race move.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was in a good wheel, I was not stressed,&#8221; Copponi told reporters in an interview after the stage. &#8220;I knew that I didn&#8217;t have to go too early, so I just waited the right moment and when Georgia went full gas, I just went full gas too.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The French rider not only pulled off a perfect sprint but also a standout celebration when she crossed the line, almost a bike length ahead of her rivals. She threw her arms out in delight and then crossed them over her body and delivered a nod of the head as if to say &#8216;that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done&#8217;.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a deal with the soigneur, I have to do this, so it&#8217;s really funny,‚Äú said Copponi. &#8220;It was a joke, but I was feeling good the day before the race and I just had to get used to the hot, and job done.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The sprint came at the end of an aggressive and warm 90km race, with numerous attacks rolling. The last one that gained significant traction was initiated by Dygert, but that dangerous effort was reeled back in with 3.5km to go. Once that occured it was all in for the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew that Chloe Dygert was going to attack up the climb ‚Ä¶ and then we just kind of controlled it really well and then our goal was just to be in the top 10 wheels coming in through the final roundabout with about a kilometre to go,‚Äù runner-up Baker said after the stage. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe knew that was going to be really decisive as the road narrows and then just kind of hold front position and ideally, I said to Ruby [Roseman-Gannon], it&#8217;d be great to have you into the final last corner, the left hander. She positioned me as well as she could and then I repositioned back onto Chloe and started my sprint about 200 meters to go.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Baker delivered a powerful surge, but Copponi came charging by and behind Barbieri found a gap in front of Dygert, leaving the Tour Down Under stage 3 winner in fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Women‚Äôs Tour Down Under may have wrapped up a week ago but the competition in South Australia was still on, with a 1.Pro race joining the fray this year. The relatively flat 90km race, run over 20 laps of a 4.5km circuit that has just 50m of elevation gain per lap, provided the teams who had come out for the WorldTour race the opportunity to sweep up some extra points. It also delivered an opportunity for two of the strongest domestic teams, Butterfields Ziptrak and Praties Cycling.</p>\n<p>The race in central Adelaide was held on the same course and over the same distance as the final men‚Äôs stage of the Tour Down Under, which would begin soon after the women‚Äôs finish. The hot weather was back again for the women‚Äôs racing, with a top temperature of 37¬∞C making it a warm day of racing even though the early start would mean the women‚Äôs peloton escaped the worst of it.</p>\n<p>After the start gun was fired it wasn‚Äôt the beginning key favourite Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) was hoping for, a crash putting both her and ProVelo Super League leader Talia Appleton (Praties Cycling) on the back foot. They had a chase on their hands but Wollaston‚Äôs teammates were there to help her back into the field.</p>\n<p>It also wasn‚Äôt the end of Wollaston‚Äôs woes, the rider having to drop off the back again with a mechanical five laps in and with Jayco-AlUla in particular following through with their pre-race plan to be aggressive, there was no easy chase back on. Wollaston had to burn valuable teammates to return at 55km to go after an extended chase.</p>\n<p>The moves kept coming and being quickly pulled back but then at 38km, a solid break of 6 formed, with Gaia Masetti (AG Insurance-Soudal) among those driving the pace, though riders kept jumping over the gap and ultimately it wasn‚Äôt so much a break but a split up peloton.</p>\n<p>Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek) then leapt off the front and was joined by Silke Smulders (Jayco-AlUla) and Simone Boilard (Uno-X). They stretched the gap and through the 11th lap of 20 Ruth Winder (Human Powered Health) joined them up the front. They were, however, pulled back and then Amber Pate (Jayco-AlUla) and Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ) soon took their turn to leap.</p>\n<p>The duo stretched the gap out to 28 seconds at one point, creating the longest lasting break of the race, which kept rolling through until the race had just over 3 laps to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan was to be aggressive, and I really enjoy that style of racing and at the end of the day, it does help our team,&#8221; said Pate. &#8220;It&#8217;s about taking the punt and sometimes you don&#8217;t make it to the finish. But today was really fun and I had a great breakaway buddy out there with me &#8230; eventually it&#8217;ll stick.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With the field still all together heading into the final two laps Dygert flew out of the bunch at around 7km to go and Barbieri jumped in the slipstream to hold on for the ride. The pursuit was on, putting pressure on the field as Jayco-AlUla drove the pace, and then the catch came at around 3.5km to go.</p>\n<p>It was then time for the final attacks to roll before the sprinter&#8217;s teams got set for the final dash to the line, where Copponi would take her first win on the road since 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20161&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=20161&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

We crashed, with Alison and C√©drine going down and we all had to chase from that and use energy.

We executed the plan so it‚Äôs super nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Trofeo Marratixi-Felanitx kicked off three days of racing at Challenge Mallorca Femenina as well as the women&#8217;s European road racing calendar. A warm day coloured by blue sky and green palm trees to welcomed the peloton to Mallorca, a balanced field of six WorldTeams, six Continental teams, five ProTeams and a Spanish national team headed from Marratxi for 129.1 of rolling kilometres at the second edition 1.1 race.</p>\n<p>Marina Garau (Bepink-Bongioanni), Afghanistan national champion Fariba Hashimi (Ceratizit Pro Cycling), Monica Castagna (top Girls Fassa Bortolo) and Julie Sap (Velopro-Alphamotorhomes) formed the break of the day, the group gaining 3:35 on the peloton just beyond the half-way point of the race. </p>\n<p>The quartet worked well together, but began to exchange looks once passing a special sprint at Ses Salines with 23km to go. Behind, the WorldTour squads UAE Team ADQ, Cofids and Movistar were pushing the chase, the gap down to under the minute mark.</p>\n<p>With 14km to go, the Afghanistan champion made a move on long, flat section, but Spain&#8217;s Garau countered. Castagna amd Sap rejoined as the peloton bore down 25 second behind with the slight rise to Ca s&#8217;Hereu Mas providing the third and final QOM points.</p>\n<p>The peloton was still spread across the wide road with 10km to go, but the sprint teams began to shift to the front with the breakaway riders in clear view ahead.

It was a season-long cyclo-cross competition, organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), that took place between 24 November 2024 and 26 January 2025.</p>\n<p>Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) started fast and finished strong, holding off a resurgent Zoe B√§ckstedt (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) to win the Maasmechelen World Cup race and show she is a favourite for next week&#8217;s UCI Cyclocross World Championships. </p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt was leading on the final lap but stumbled on the key off-camber sector. She was suddenly five seconds behind Vas but fought back in the final sectors. </p>\n<p>Vas dived into the final corner with B√§ckstedt almost in her slipstream but the finish line was in sight and she could celebrate a huge win in the mud. Despite her strong ride in the World Cup elite division, B√§ckstedt confirmed she will ride the under-23 race at the World Championships.</p>\n<p>Lucinda Brand (Baloise Glowi Lions) was third at 12 seconds, with Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) fourth at 28 seconds, after going over her bike on the barriers. </p>\n<p>&#8220;After a tough couple of years, I&#8217;m back at the top, it&#8217;s great to do it. I&#8217;m really happy with the victory, &#8221; Vas said proudly. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I practised the off-camber a lot and we even came to train on the course on Friday. I think it was also smart to only change my bike once and that helped me come back to the front.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;On the last downhill sector, I looked back and saw that Zoe was coming full gas, but luckily I had the legs sprint.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Fem van Empel (Visma-Lease a Bike) led from the start but Vas soon took over, showed her intentions and lined out the big-name favourites on the muddy but fast course. </p>\n<p>Van Empel slipped on the steep off-camber section and lost places, as Brand moved up after a difficult start.  </p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt was constantly in the top four positions and opened a gap as the third of five laps began. Pieterse was only four seconds back, with Brand at five seconds and Vas at eight seconds. They were racing for victory, everyone else was already over 30 seconds behind. </p>\n<p>The race shuffled again on lap four when B√§ckstedt slipped out on the off-camber section, and four riders came together once again. Van Empel flipped over her bike on the same section and so did Ceylin Del Carmen Alvarado (Fenix-Deceuninck). Most riders were forced to run the section. Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) also took a dive later, with her front wheel sinking deep into the mud.  </p>\n<p>Through the trees and mud, Brand upped the pace and opened a gap but the others came back to her, taking different lines through the puddles and mud and using their different techniques to fight for the front.   </p>\n<p>Then suddenly Brand lost contact with the front group. B√§ckstedt did not hesitate and surged away, the bell ringing as she crossed the line to start the final lap. </p>\n<p>She looked like she was heading for victory but then slipped out on the fatal off-camber. Vas got up to her and surged away. Behind Pieterse crashed on the barriers, as her front wheel sunk into the mud and she flipped over the bike. </p>\n<p>Vas was away and riding to victory, with B√§ckstedt at five seconds. However, the 20-year-old and huge favourite for the under-23 women&#8217;s World Championships refused to give up. </p>\n<p>She found a final surge of speed and closed the gap. Fortunately for Vas, the finish came quickly and so she took her second World Cup win of her career. After two difficult seasons, she is back to her very best. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19075&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19075&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was a season-long cyclo-cross competition, organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), that took place between 24 November 2024 and 26 January 2025.</p>\n<p>Fem van Empel (Visma-Lease A Bike) took victory in the ninth round of the UCI Cyclocross World Cup in Benidorm, prevailing in the sprint at the end of a thrilling race which, for the most part, saw a group of around a dozen riders fighting for the win.</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old beat Lucinda Brand (Baloise Glowi Lions) to the line as the pair accelerated away at the end of the sixth and final lap in Spain. Two seconds further back, Marie Schreiber (SD Worx-Protime) rounded out the podium just ahead of Van Empel&#8217;s Visma teammate Marianne Vos.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was exciting. I&#8217;m always happy to race here. The crowd was amazing and it&#8217;s an amazing race,&#8221; Van Empel said later of her third Benidorm victory in as many years. &#8220;During the start, I was focussed and I think I was in first or second position for the whole race so yes, I was always in control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year, the final was really about the last corner, which shows that it&#8217;s exciting here every year. I&#8217;m always happy to race here. The crowd is great and there are a lot of children along the side,&#8221; she added, according to WielerFlits.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I was in control for the whole race. My start was focussed and I was always in first or second position. Lucinda closed the door well the whole time, but the barriers were one of the last opportunities to find a gap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went full throttle over them and had already done my sprint before the asphalt. The way I win is special, that shows my fighting spirit. I am happy with my season and with this victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There were plenty of big names present at the start in Benidorm, though Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) was a notable absentee through illness. As a result, the early stages of the fast race through the sand saw a large group form up front packed with favourites.</p>\n<p>Efforts came and went, including from Van Empel and Schreiber, as Brand battled back from a tough start. But by the start of the third lap, a group of around a dozen riders led the way.</p>\n<p>Van Empel, Brand, Schreiber, and Vos were up there. So too were Ceylin Del Carmen Alvarado (Fenix-Deceuninck), Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Crelan-Corendon trio Sara Casasola, Manon Bakker, and Inge van der Heijden, and French duo Amandine Fouquenet (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and C√©lia Gery (AS Bike Racing), and Zoe Backstedt (Canyon-SRAM Zondacrypto).</p>\n<p>Van Empel and Brand both took turns upping the pace, but at the start of the next lap, 11 still remained in the lead group, prompting Brand to once again push on. This time, a selection was made, with Van Empel, Vas and Alvarado following to make it four up front.</p>\n<p>Alvarado couldn&#8217;t hang with the high pace though, and by lap five she was chasing at five seconds down while Casasola (11 seconds) and the larger chase group (14 seconds) looked to be out of contention.</p>\n<p>But things didn&#8217;t stay that way as the pace slowed up on the asphalt, letting the chasers back in and bringing the numbers at the front back to 11. Brand, Van Empel and Vas were joined once again by Alvarado, Vos, Schreiber, Casasola, Van der Heijden, Fouquenet, Backstedt and Visma-Lease A Bike teen Vikt√≥ria Chladanov√°.</p>\n<p>Brand continued to make the pace on the front on lap six as the finish line loomed, with the 35-year-old&#8217;s acceleration proving once again too much for most of the riders who had rejoined. She led Van Empel, Vos, and Schreiber into the final stages of the race, though the world champion came through to take over as the quartet dismounted to get over the beams.</p>\n<p>It would stay that way to the end as Van Empel led the group into the final stages of the closing lap. She opened the sprint, distancing Schreiber and Vos, while Brand could only stay in her shadow to take second place. Further back, Vas was the best of the chase group, coming away with fifth place at 13 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Despite taking away 40 points to Brand&#8217;s 30, it&#8217;s Brand who remains in the overall lead of the UCI World Cup standings. With a 51-point advantage holds a near-unassailable lead with two rounds in Maasmechelen and Hoogerheide left to run.</p>\n<p>Brand, on 285 points, leads Van Empel on 234, while Backsted is third on 194, ahead of Schreiber (188) and Vas (183).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19119&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19119&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will begin on 17th of January in Brighton and will finish on 19th of January in Stirling.</p>\n<p>Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) survived an onslaught of attacks in the final 30 kilometres to win the 2025 Women&#8217;s Tour Down Under in Stirling. The Swiss champion fought til the end and finished third on the stage to secure her first WorldTour stage race victory. </p>\n<p>R√ºegg, isolated, faced relentless challenges from multiple teams, particularly Lidl-Trek, repeatedly forcing her to close gaps on her own. Despite the continuous pressure, none of the attacks succeeded, leading to a reduced bunch sprint.</p>\n<p>R√ºegg admitted that defending the ochre leader&#8217;s jersey was &#8220;quite a challenge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, they didn&#8217;t make it easy for us. For sure, they tried a lot of moves, especially in the last two laps. The first three laps were actually quite OK. I expected it to be harder, and then, I was just super nervous, honestly, the whole day, I was like, I really want to bring it home,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And the team did amazing again, and so I could kind of save all my energy in the beginning and then just focused on the last two laps followed all the moves. And I could keep it until the end. I&#8217;m super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following her teammate‚Äôs wheel,  Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) bided her time in the reduced peloton and opened her sprint in the final uphill metres to take the stage victory. Crossing the line one second later, Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) finished second on the stage, just ahead of R√ºegg.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s really good,&#8221; Dygert said of the stage victory. &#8220;We came here to try to get GC and to get a stage win. And so, we really worked hard today. We went all in for the stage win because GC was kind of out of contention, so we all put in a huge effort for today, and we&#8217;re really happy to pull it off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>R√ºegg topped the final general classification with 13 seconds on Smulders. Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (UNO-X Mobility) retained her third place overall, at 37 seconds in arrears.</p>\n<p>Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian Cycling Team) sprinted to the maximum points in the second QOM of the stage to secure the mountains classification victory while R√ºegg, with her stage victory and third in the finale brought home the points classification in addition to the overall.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIce vests and a spot in the air-conditioned comfort of the team mini-vans were key at the start of the 105.9 kilometre finale starting and finishing in Stirling with the temperature already creeping over 30¬∞C before the morning start to racing. Then when it came to lining up the lumps from ice stockings tucked into the back of the jerseys were prominent.</p>\n<p>Everyone was getting ready for a hot stage of racing, both with the temperature and action on the road, particularly as the unrelenting course provided continued GC hope to those who hadn‚Äôt made the mark on the overall they had hoped to on Willunga Hill.</p>\n<p>When the race set off for the first of five unrelenting loops, which would deliver a total of 2,142m of elevation gain through the stage, the peloton was initially largely content to stay together. The first pass of the finish line spurred some action, with Queen of the Mountain points up for grabs and a tight battle at the top of that category. Dominika Wlodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) had stepped into the jersey on the Willunga stage but by just one point ahead of Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian Cycling Team).</p>\n<p>Wlodarczyk‚Äôs teammates Karlijn Swinkels and Sofia Bertizzolo came to the fore to sweep up points at 85.2km to go but Polites still grabbed one with fourth, equalling up the competition.</p>\n<p>Niamh Fisher Black (Lidl-Trek) then triggered a flurry of attacks at 71km to go. Groups formed and were caught but the ultimate outcome was that Ella Simpson (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93) kicked on out the front alone carving out a gap of 1:30 by the time the race looped through the start/finish line again at 63.2km to go.</p>\n<p>There were points when the gap fell below a minute during the next lap, particularly when Maike van der Duin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) strung out the peloton with her scorching attack, but Simpson kept tapping away and had pulled the margin to around two minutes as she approached Stirling for another pass.</p>\n<p>With the kilometres ticking down to under 40km to go the flurries continued as the teams worked to put the pressure on the EF Education-Oatly team of the ochre jersey-clad Noemi R√ºegg. The aggressive moves, with plenty coming from Lidl-Trek meant Simpson‚Äôs gap was quickly chewed up, with the 22-year-old swallowed up by the peloton and the race was all together at 35km to go.</p>\n<p>Though there were soon plenty of efforts to break it apart, with Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), who had been active through the race, off the front again, and Emily Watts tried to replicate the earlier move of her St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93 teammate but the peloton was on its toes. The toll could be seen at the back, with riders tailing off.</p>\n<p>The attacks kept rolling as the race counted down toward 25km to go, with race leader R√ºegg herself chasing down one from 2020 winner Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health).</p>\n<p>At 21.3km to go, the battle for the QOM classification played out, with Wlodarczyk and Polites out front with teammate Nicole Frain. The former Liv-AlUla-Jayco rider played her hand to perfection, timing the sprint so she could claim top points ahead of the Polish champion by half a wheel. With that effort Polites secured the climbers jersey.</p>\n<p>In the final lap, and down to 16km to go, Tiffany Cromwell (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) delivered down multiple attacks and then teammate Van der Duin put in another, getting a gap and stretching out and splintering the field in pursuit behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was over 20 seconds as the race neared 10km to go but soon she was reeled back in. With just over 7km to go it was Lauretta Hanson‚Äôs turn to pour on the pressure onto the shrinking peloton for Lidl-Trek and then it was New Zealand champion Ella Wyllie who clipped off the front for Liv AlUla Jayco. She remained out front until around 3.5km to go and then in the final two kilometres the peloton split further after a small touch of wheels.</p>\n<p>Into the last two kilometres and it was a group of around 20 out the front, then into the final kilometre, Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) opened up, finishing off an aggressive stage for her team with a trip to the top step.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

So I really need a team that supports me, and I have to believe in myself and to win gives me so much confidence and gives me the proof that I did everything right the last few weeks and years. So yeah, really makes me proud, and super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>R√ºegg takes over the ochre leader‚Äôs jersey with 15 seconds on Smulders, and 33 seconds on Ottestad. Fifth on the stage, Dominika Wlodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) sits in fourth place, 36 seconds down and only one second ahead of trio Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal), Bradbury and Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez).</p>\n<p>Overnight leader Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit-WNT) lost touch with the peloton the first time up Willunga Hill, and dropped to 33rd overall, over five minutes down.</p>\n<p>The 2025 Women Tour Down Under concludes the 105.9km stage 3, featuring  five-and-a-half loops around in Stirling, delivering constant undulation with barely a moment of flat terrain in the mix.</p>\n<p>R√ºegg &#8220;definitely&#8221; intends to defend her leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúActually stage three was the one I was targeting most. And then when I did the recon of this climb, I thought, well, that&#8217;s actually also pretty good for me. But actually, in the beginning, we said that&#8217;s more for Megan, tomorrow would be more for me. So I think we just have to stay strong tomorrow and also just enjoy. This is my first win on the WorldTour level. I also just want to enjoy it. And, tomorrow we will see, but today was amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe heat was on for the queen stage of the women&#8217;s Santos Tour Down Under, with clear blue skies and soaring temperatures making a tough day in the saddle even harder. Three riders dropped out before the start &#8211; Mara Roldan (Picnic-PostNl), who collapsed after the finish and ended her day in an ambulance, understandably did not start stage 2. Two others, Eglantine Rayer (FDJ-SUEZ) and Teuntje Beekhuis (Uno-X Mobility), also dropped out.</p>\n<p>The remaining 79 riders departed Unley and the race stayed together for the first 10km as the route went straight uphill to Windy Point, where Polish champion Dominika Wlodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) led at the summit ahead of mountains classification leader Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian National Team).</p>\n<p>Not long after the climb, Polites&#8217; teammate Alli Andersen went on the attack, but she could only open up a lead of about 30 seconds. The pace heated up and Andersen was caught on an unclassified ascent after 23.5km of racing.</p>\n<p>The team continued their aggressive tactics, launching Maeve Plouffe off the front immediately after. Plouffe managed a lead of nearly a minute, but a counter-attack from FDJ-SUEZ&#8217;s Marie Le Net drew out an 11-rider chase with Amber Pate (Liv AlUla Jayco), Kristyna Burlova (Ceratizit-WNT), Rachele Barbieri (Picnic-PostNL), Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ), Maike van der Duin (Canyon-Sram), Babette van der Wolf (EF Education-Oatly) and Emily Watts (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93), among others. However, the peloton immediately closed the move down.</p>\n<p>The race settled in for a short while before Anderson attacked again after the feed zone with 62.5km to go and pulled out a lead of 42 seconds before the intermediate sprint, where Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) continued her push for the points jersey, taking the points behind Anderson.</p>\n<p>Ten riders attacked after the sprint and began chipping away at Anderson&#8217;s advantage. They had her in sight with 56.2km to go but the peloton reeled the chase group in and then sat up.</p>\n<p>With the first ascent of Willunga still more than 20km away, Anderson was allowed a gap of 1:10 before an attack from Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ) started to chip into the gap. She made it across to Anderson with 40km to go, with a gap of more than a minute on the bunch.</p>\n<p>Canyon-SRAM took up the chase, stringing out the bunch much as they did on the opening stage, and then tried to launch Maike van der Duin. Two successive crashes took down Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) first and then her teammate Niamh Fisher-Black along with Lauren Bates (ARA Australian National Team), but all were quickly back up and in the peloton.</p>\n<p>The lead pair&#8217;s gap was out to 1:30 with 5km til the second intermediate sprint but with the start of the first ascent of Willunga right after it, the chase picked up and carved 35 seconds out of their advantage at the sprint.</p>\n<p>Wollaston left Anderson behind as the grade kicked in but the chase was on from the GC riders, and she too was back in the fold before the summit.</p>\n<p>Amanda Spratt led teammate Fisher-Black past Wollaston with 25km to go and 2.1km until the crest of Willunga Hill and continued to push the pace until the final kilometre, shedding all but about 18 riders.</p>\n<p>Fisher-Black led the small lead group over the summit, and then Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) attacked. The Swiss rider was quickly reeled in by Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) before Chabbey&#8217;s teammate Amber Kraak tried to launch a move.</p>\n<p>The attacks continued with Alice Towers pushing the pace for Canyon-SRAM but Kim Cadzow (EF Education-Oatly) shut that move down.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Chabbey drilled it, pulling away six riders with a couple more scrambling across aas the speed of the riders touched nearly 90kph. With 10km to go and only 11 riders still in the front, Dygert launched a searing attack to rejoin the lead group and teammate Towers.</p>\n<p>With 7.4km to go, Ceratizit-WNT&#8217;s Dilyxine Miermont attacked and was covered by Ella Simpson (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93). Behind, a second group joined the lead dozen.</p>\n<p>Spratt, Swinkels and Dygert went on the move with 6km to go but the larger group was able to shut them down rapidly and the wind briefly went out of the lead group as the final climb approached.</p>\n<p>Dygert wasn&#8217;t content to ride easy and powered clear, chased immediately by Julie van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Kraak but the American reached Willunga solo.</p>\n<p>Fisher-Black accelerated past the two chasers with 3km to go and then past Dygert. Bradbury leapt across to the Kiwi, and soon Silke Smulder (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) and Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) joined in, too.</p>\n<p>With Chabbey and Wlodarczyk approaching, Fisher-Black accelerated but the two came across with 2km to go and the pace in the lead group briefly dropped. A surge from Chabbey incited a counter from Fisher-Black, but still, the six riders came back together for the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Bradbury went as she saw the one kilometre-to-go sign but still R√ºegg, Fisher-Black and Smulders were able to match it. A surge from the Swiss champion put all but Smulders behind, and secured the stage win and the ochre leader‚Äôs jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The 22-year-old Dutch rider kept her head down, pushing the gap to two minutes inside of 30 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Alarms starting to ring in the peloton and Canyon-SRAM sent Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell to the front to chase, but without any concerted help from other teams, the peloton was too late to catch the solo rider.  </p>\n<p>Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ) took the chaotic field sprint for second place and Kathrin Schweinberger (Human Powered Health) was third.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld admitted that her attack was in response to suffering on the lone categorized climb of the day.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was actually not even thinking, I was just it&#8217;s a new team and we wanted to be aggressive and I was actually struggling on the climb and I was like well, I better just go now because everybody is struggling.

Schweinberger is a further two seconds back.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 should deliver the most decisive of the three days of racing as the peloton tackles 115km from Unley to the top of Willunga Hill.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\n82 riders made up the peloton for the first Women‚Äôs WorldTour race of the year as Marit Raaijmakers (Human Powered Health) and Anouska Koster of UNO-X Mobility were non-starters.</p>\n<p>The bunch remained together through the first 18km until Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian National Team) launched a move and, not drawing out any companions, she forged on alone. The 2021 triple junior national champion who raced with Jayco-AlUla in 2023 looked to have something to prove with her attack, and she gained a maximum of 2:30 before the peloton got to work to control the gap.</p>\n<p>A crash from Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) briefly interrupted the chasing peloton as half a dozen riders came down with her, but the pace soon picked up and Polites&#8217; gap began to fall.</p>\n<p>Polites led through the first intermediate sprint and, more importantly, stayed clear for the sole classified climb on Heatherdale Hill with 54km to go to secure the lead in the mountains classification. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the summit, the peloton breezed past with counter-attacks flying.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the finish line right on the QOM,&#8221; Polites said. &#8220;They just really egged me on in the car. And I made it across.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit-WNT) was the next attacker to go clear solo into the crosswind. With 45.5km to go, a counter-attack of four riders from the peloton went after the Dutch woman, including Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Only Marturano continued in pursuit of the solo leader as the peloton was happy to save their legs for the final 45km. Hengeveld having a lead of only 28 seconds on the bunch contributed to the lack of motivation to chase.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld stayed clear for the second intermediate sprint with 30.1km to go, having carved out a gap of well over one minute while Marturano was absorbed by the peloton. Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) mopped up the points for second place in the sprint, adding to her tally after doing the same in the first intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>On the uncategorised climb inside the final 30km, Hengeveld added to her advantage, approaching the summit of the steepest pitch with two minutes in hand and only 27.5km to go. However, the 22-year-old had five more kilometres of gradual climbing and a long descent into Aldinga Beach ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite teams like Canyon-SRAM with Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell, Hengeveld&#8217;s gap was nearly three minutes as she neared the final 20km of the stage. Once the climbs were over, FDJ-SUEZ, AG Insurance-Soudal and EF-Education-Oatly sent riders to help nullify Hengeveld&#8217;s 2:30 lead, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be coming down fast enough.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld still had almost 2 minutes on the field with only 8.5 kilometres and her gap was just too much for the field. A furtive chase in the closing kilometres failed to bring the Dutch rider back, and she finished 42 seconds ahead of the peloton led home by Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The 2021 triple junior national champion who raced with Jayco-AlUla in 2023 looked to have something to prove with her attack, and she gained a maximum of 2:30 before the peloton got to work to control the gap.</p>\n<p>A crash from Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) briefly interrupted the chasing peloton as half a dozen riders came down with her, but the pace soon picked up and Polites&#8217; gap began to fall.</p>\n<p>Polites led through the first intermediate sprint and, more importantly, stayed clear for the sole classified climb on Heatherdale Hill with 54km to go to secure the lead in the mountains classification. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the summit, the peloton breezed past with counter-attacks flying.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the finish line right on the QOM,&#8221; Polites said. &#8220;They just really egged me on in the car. And I made it across.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit-WNT) was the next attacker to go clear solo into the crosswind. With 45.5km to go, a counter-attack of four riders from the peloton went after the Dutch woman, including Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Only Marturano continued in pursuit of the solo leader as the peloton was happy to save their legs for the final 45km. Hengeveld having a lead of only 28 seconds on the bunch contributed to the lack of motivation to chase.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld stayed clear for the second intermediate sprint with 30.1km to go, having carved out a gap of well over one minute while Marturano was absorbed by the peloton. Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) mopped up the points for second place in the sprint, adding to her tally after doing the same in the first intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>On the uncategorised climb inside the final 30km, Hengeveld added to her advantage, approaching the summit of the steepest pitch with two minutes in hand and only 27.5km to go. However, the 22-year-old had five more kilometres of gradual climbing and a long descent into Aldinga Beach ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite teams like Canyon-SRAM with Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell, Hengeveld&#8217;s gap was nearly three minutes as she neared the final 20km of the stage. Once the climbs were over, FDJ-SUEZ, AG Insurance-Soudal and EF-Education-Oatly sent riders to help nullify Hengeveld&#8217;s 2:30 lead, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be coming down fast enough.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld still had almost 2 minutes on the field with only 8.5 kilometres and her gap was just too much for the field. A furtive chase in the closing kilometres failed to bring the Dutch rider back, and she finished 42 seconds ahead of the peloton led home by Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The 13.6-kilometre circuit twists and turns through King‚Äôs Park before the peloton race alongside spectacular waterfront views beside the Swan River and into the CBD. The punchy climb up William Street and Malcolm Street tops out just 400 metres before the finish straight. These late pinches, combined with an uphill drag within the park, make for a course that will suit a wide range of riders, making it anyone‚Äôs race. </p>\n<p>Lucinda Stewart kicked off her career with the Liv AlUla Jayco Continental team in fine style as she swept up the elite and U23 women&#8217;s road race titles at the AusCycling Road National Championships in Perth on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The 20-year-old emerged victorious from a break of five that clipped away early on, making the most of her powerful sprint to beat Ella Simpson (St Michel &#8211; Preference Home &#8211; Auber93) on the line of the 109km race.</p>\n<p>Local gravel-focused rider Cassia Boglio (Pas Racing) then captured the third spot on a winners&#8217; podium framed by spectacular city and waterside views.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm so happy,&#8221; a breathless Stewart said in the post-race interview on broadcaster SBS after being heartily congratulated by Amber Pate, who rushed toward her with shouts of &#8220;I knew you could&#8221; as she dived in to give her new Liv AlUla Jayco teammate an embrace.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt know what to say, I just feel so much pride in these [Liv AlUla Jayco] colours. I look up to these girls, my teammates so, so much, and have so much respect for them. I knew how strong they are and to be the only one in the break for my team &#8211; I knew I had to pull it off and there was no other option.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Katelyn Nicholson (Butterfields Ziptrak) was fourth while the final rider from the break over the line was Sophia Sammons (Praties Cycling). Her fifth place overall also allowed Sammons to claim second in the U23 category while tenth placed rider Alyssa Polites (Meridian Blue Cycling p/b 99 Bikes)  took the third and final spot in the U23 category. </p>\n<p>The last time a rider swept up both titles in the combined race was when Sarah Gigante took the win in 2019, in her first year out of the junior ranks in Buninyong.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nRiders lined up in Kings Park with the normal nerves of a National Championships perhaps amped up by the added unknown factor of the change of course from its long-time home of Buninyong. They were facing eight laps of a 13.6km loop which headed past the Swan River and through the city centre, its 193m of elevation gain and some punchy climbs with gradients topping out at 12% providing a challenge in each of its final kilometres.</p>\n<p>There may have been less climbing overall but the fragmented men‚Äôs U23 race on Saturday with a high attrition rate had demonstrated that the short sharp kicks, wind and heat could make it a tough course to tackle and breaks weren‚Äôt necessarily easy to reel back in.</p>\n<p>Perhaps with that in mind, there was a relatively tentative start from the field, with only a couple of digs in the opening lap. During lap two, however, a break went that stuck in the shape of a group of six containing U23 riders Lucinda Stewart (Liv AlU Jayco Continental team) and Sophia Sammons (Praties Cycling), along with Ella Simpson (St Michel &#8211; Preference Home &#8211; Auber93), Cassia Boglio (PAS Racing) Lauren Thomas (McLardy McShane Insurance Advisors &#8211; Bomad Cycling) and Katelyn Nicholson (Butterfields Ziptrak).</p>\n<p>The group which was devoid of Women&#8217;s WorldTour riders quickly set to work on stretching their margin, and by the time there was 82.4km of the 109km race left the gap was already around two and a half minutes and it just continued to blow out. Thomas fell away, leaving five out the front to keep up the pace while the bunch behind was starting to look nervous but not enough to combine for a cohesive chase. </p>\n<p>That meant that well before the halfway point of the race the gap had climbed to around five minutes, raising doubts about whether the favourites had already let their chance go.</p>\n<p>At just under 60km to go, the attacks from the bunch began in earnest with time trial winner and 2023 road race victor Brodie Chapman (UAE Team ADQ) plus last year‚Äôs third-placed rider Alexander Manly (AG Insurance-Soudal) among the early aggressors. It was, however just the beginning and the moves just kept flying with the 2021 junior road race and time trial winner Alyssa Polites (Meridian Blue Cycling p/b 99 Bikes), 2021 title winner Sarah Roy (EF-Oatly-Cannondale) and Amber Pate (Liv AlUla Jayco) also on the list of those testing the waters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it was during the fifth lap that Pate got away with three-times title winner Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek) and the duo headed off in pursuit of the lead group of five, with only a little more than three laps left to hunt them down. They chipped away at the gap, but as the bell rang for the final there were still around three minutes between the leading group of five and the two chasing seasoned WorldTour professionals. Meanwhile, the peloton, at more than five minutes back, was completely out of the game. </p>\n<p>The five at the front remained together for most of the final lap, tracking through Kings Park, past the Swan River and through the city centre. However, Simpson and Stewart caused some splits as they put pressure on during the final climbs inside the last kilometre.</p>\n<p>That was the point where Sammons popped and while Boglio and Nicholson kept within reach they couldn‚Äôt rival Simpson or Stewart, who cannily sat behind her rival before diving over the line with a throw of the bike to take the biggest win of her career so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14409&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14409&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Most countries&#8217; national championships are held on the second weekend in January</p>\n<p>Marion Norbert Riberolle (Crelan-Corendon) fought back from an important early crash to clinch the Belgian National Cyclocross Championships with a fine solo win.</p>\n<p>A bronze medallist last year, the top favourite battled through snow and thick mud to overtake all her rivals and finish nearly a minute clear of Laura Verdonschot (De Ceuster-Bouwpunt).</p>\n<p>After a prolonged duel with Verdonschot, Julie Brouwers (Charles Li√©geois Roastery CX) completed the podium.</p>\n<p>Sterre Vervloet celebrated after crossing the line as the winner of the women&#8217;s U23 title.</p>\n<p>Norbert Riberolle&#8217;s lone triumph ends a 15-year run of victories in the Championships for Sanne Cant, soon to retire and who did not take part in the race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a boxing match at the start. My front wheel was broken, but I thought: I&#8217;ll stay calm,&#8221; Norbert Riberolle said about her crash. &#8220;But it was right at the start and it&#8217;s like this every weekend. So I didn&#8217;t get that stressed.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Asked about how it felt to take over as Belgian champion from her trade teammate Cant, she said, &#8220;When I see Sanne with a different jersey, it feels very strange. But to become champion after Sanne is super nice and I am also super happy for the team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nRacing was delayed by one hour because of the intensely cold weather currently affecting so much of northern Europe. But even so riders still had to plough through snow-covered, muddy ground and handle freezing temperatures for the whole of the five-lap, mist-enshrouded course.</p>\n<p>Norbert Riberolle had a very difficult start with an early crash on one of the first bends, all but falling as the 26-year-old collided heavily with a rival and broke three spokes in one wheel. As a result, the former U23 World Champion effectively began the race in 20th spot on a lined-out, fast-shattering peloton, although a rapid bike changeover and effective use of trade teammates to pace her back through her rivals showed the lead favourite was not going to take this setback lightly.</p>\n<p>With the pack scattered to the four winds in the difficult racing conditions, Norbert Riberolle found herself a handful of seconds behind a lead group of four riders, from which Alicia Franck and Laura Verdonschot rapidly emerged. However, Norbert Riberolle was quickly regaining momentum and she shot past the De Ceuster-Bouwpunt duo to power into the lead well before the end of the second lap. </p>\n<p>With Norbert Riberolle clearly back in command and rapidly rising morale, from hereon the main question was how quickly her advantage would increase, and by the close of lap two, her lone move was already netting her a double-digit gap. Verdonschot remained her closest opponent, though, with Franck dropping back and Julie Brouwers (Charles Li√©geois Roastery CX) coming into contention for the podium. But neither the persistent Verdonschot nor Brouwers, in any case, seemed able to handle the pace set by a flying Norbert Riberolle.</p>\n<p>Seemingly impervious to the miserable weather and course conditions, and picking her line faultlessly time after time through the churned-up mud ruts and snow drifts, by the end of lap 3, Norbert Riberolle&#8217;s gap on the chasing duo was over 30 seconds and she had only herself to beat.</p>\n<p>Going into energy-saving mode in such tricky terrain was the ideal option, yet despite playing a conservative game late on, Norbert Riberolle was well on course to adding her first Belgian title to the one taken in France before she switched nationalities in 2021. Coming into the last corner, her advantage was such that she could begin high-fiving the crowd, with that early setback likely only making her third win of the season all the sweeter.</p>\n<p>If the battle for gold was effectively a one-rider race for most of the course, the duel for silver was a much more protracted affair between Verdonschot and Brouwers. Finally Verdonschot, despite suffering from a vascular stenosis, was able to repeat her silver of last year, with Brouwers lagging behind on the last lap, a crash putting the 22-year-old definitively out of contention for the runner-up spot.</p>\n<p>The same race also saw Sterre Vervloet crowned Belgian U23 Champion, the 21-year-old crossing the line in seventh place, and veteran Joyce Vanderbeken taking another title for the category of elite riders without a contract.</p>\n<p>But the biggest question of the day is whether Norbert Riberolle will now dominate the Belgian Nationals in the same way as Sanne Cant did for so long. Only time will tell, of course, but on Saturday in the freezing, snowy conditions of Heusden-Zolder Norbert Riberolle certainly got off to the best of starts.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15056&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15056&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Taking place in late December or early January, the event has often marked the unofficial start of the road season ‚Äì a sign to cycling fans all over the world that road racing is slowly returning. Criterium racing is a little different to the classic road racing we all know and love, but at its core it‚Äôs very much the same. Races consist of several laps of a short, sometimes technical circuit and often end in scrappy bunch sprints. Laps are typically quite short, meaning races only last for a couple of hours at most. Organisers also like to include a ton of corners and tricky bends in their circuits to really test a rider‚Äôs technical skills. In short, criteriums are road races on overdrive ‚Äì action-packed, hour-long exhibitions where the nation‚Äôs best sprinters go toe to toe for the win and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì the bragging rights.</p>\n<p>It was a dominant performance from Amber Pate (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Keira Will at the combined elite women&#8217;s and U23 criterium at the AusCycling Road National Championships on Friday, the pair breaking away early to claim the two respective titles up for grabs as they crossed the line in first and second place. </p>\n<p>The race was cut short as the powerful duo got so far ahead that the back of the peloton was dragged within view and then when Pate attacked and dropped her break companion, the gap dwindled even further. The imminent threat of the catch led the commissaires to call the final two laps ten minutes early.</p>\n<p>That left the bunch to sprint for third, a charge won by Maeve Plouffe (Hess), while Pate then had plenty of time out front to enjoy her solo win and the 19-year-old Will crossed the line 19 seconds later to claim second place overall and the U23 title.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The team were really awesome, we all went in with the right mindset, any one of us could have won today and I thought let&#8217;s crack on early. It‚Äôll help the team, it‚Äôll help bring up the pace,‚Äù Pate said in an interview with broadcaster SBS immediately after the event.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt worked out perfectly today and it‚Äôs awesome to keep this crit jersey with the team,‚Äù said the rider who won in 2023 and supported teammate Ruby Roseman-Gannon to victory in 2024.</p>\n<p>The new home for the race in 2025 was a fast but technical 1.2km course in Perth&#8217;s Northbridge that included six corners, wide boulevards and narrow side streets. The combined women‚Äôs elite and U23 event was meant to unfold over 50 minutes and two laps in the sunny late afternoon in Perth but the strength of the early move changed that.</p>\n<p>It was only around ten minutes into the race that Pate leapt out of the bunch with Will, who looked every bit the experienced player as she worked seamlessly out the front with the Liv AlUla Jayco rider.</p>\n<p>The duo quickly got a gap of around 30 seconds with Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Amanda Spratt and Lauretta Hanson notable among the riders who made attempts to haul the duo back. However, ultimately the pace slowed in the bunch and as the 30-minute mark approached the gap had stretched beyond a minute.</p>\n<p>The erratic pace in the group continued with various attacks but Liv AlUla Jayco was also quick to chase or join any moves, which neutralised many of the shifts. Spratt also put in a substantial late solo dig but it was then that Pate made the winning move.</p>\n<p>The elastic quickly stretched and at that point, Pate had the rear of the bunch in view and with the writing on the wall as they headed through the start/finish line, the race was shortened.

It was a season-long cyclo-cross competition, organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), that took place between 24 November 2024 and 26 January 2025.</p>\n<p>Lucinda Brand (Baloise Glowi Lions) triumphed solo in brutally tough muddy and wet conditions at the Dendermonde World Cup for her seventh win of the cyclocross season, extending her lead in the overall series at the same time.</p>\n<p>Former world champion Brand took an early lead on the opening lap and only ceded it momentarily to Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck) on lap 2, before gradually chasing her down and riding solo to the finish after 55 minutes of dominance.</p>\n<p>Pieterse held on to second despite suffering two untimely flat tyres partway through the race, with the current world champion Fem van Empel (Visma-Lease a Bike) fighting back after a slow start to take third place at the line. </p>\n<p>Brand, who donned the jersey of the World Cup leader in the mud, entered the day with a huge 46-point lead from Van Empel but will now head into the final three rounds with a 61-point advantage thanks to her second World Cup win of the 2024-25 season. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It feels really good to win, but also I think it&#8217;s the first time I thought &#8216;oh another lap, really?'&#8221; said Brand post-race.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the second last lap, my gap increased so I knew I just had to focus on the very tough parts, to keep enough speed there, and then I was secure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The riders knew what was in store as the rain continued to fall on the muddy field that awaited them in Dendermonde, with Van Empel getting the best start alongside Leonie Bentveld (Pauwels Sauzen-Cibel Clementines) and Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado (Fenix-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Quickly, however, Brand came to the front proving why she&#8217;s in the World Cup leader&#8217;s jersey. She immediately found a lead and showed off her power in the heavy mud. </p>\n<p>Pieterse and Zoe B√§ckstedt (Canyon-SRAM) were the next best in the brutal conditions, with the former moving into second and hanging onto Brand&#8217;s wheel best in the early stages. </p>\n<p>The second lap saw Pieterse take the lead after Brand headed into the pits for a new bike and made a small error when she got her front wheel stuck and had to dismount over her handlebars, thankfully onto her feet. </p>\n<p>With Pieterse knowing that Brand&#8217;s diesel engine would see her finish quickest, she tried to build a big enough lead to hold off any late charge. However, the current Dutch champion was soon back on her wheel by the end of lap 3.</p>\n<p>B√§ckstedt stayed close in the chase, with Van Empel joining up after her slower-than-normal start and Manon Bakker (Crelan-Corendon) also putting in a strong ride to make it a trio. </p>\n<p>Pieterse lost ground to Brand due to an untimely flat tyre but as the Dutch champion accelerated through the pits and away from her compatriot, it was clear who the strongest rider was.</p>\n<p>At the end of lap 4, Pieterse was only 15 seconds behind, but this extended by the end of lap 5 to 27 seconds and was even larger at the end of the race at 30 seconds. She looked in danger of losing third to Van Empel until she too suffered a flat and had to settle for third.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24300&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24300&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

However, her resolve was eventually broken by Brand&#8217;s diesel engine and she dropped back to fight out second place with B√§ckstedt.</p>\n<p>Alvarado was passed by the Brit on one of the running sections of the course before launching her sprint better initially. But B√§ckstedt responded in the run for the line and narrowly pipped the Dutch rider with a bike throw at the line. </p>\n<p>After Alvarado started the day leading the women&#8217;s elite Superprestige series by one point over Brand, the situation was flipped at the end of the day due to B√§ckstedt coming second, with Brand jumping to first just one point ahead of her compatriot. </p>\n<p>The series will be decided at the final round on February 8 at the Superprestige Middelkerke.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During the second lap, I was feeling really good.

Many races are held in the province of Antwerp with others being held across Belgium. The way that the general classification was calculated was changed from a points system to using the riders&#8217; finishing times of each race (like a road racing stage race) with time &#8216;bonuses&#8217; also available at an intermediate &#8216;sprint&#8217; at the end of the first lap with 15, 10 and 5 seconds being awarded.

World Champion Fem van Empel (Visma-Lease a Bike) was third at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p>Koksijde was Brand&#8217;s 13th second place of the season while Pieterse rode a near perfect  race across the sand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really nice to win, especially a big race like Koksijde,&#8221; she said immediately after her victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Sand is not normally my thing, but today I could do a smooth ride in the dunes and I kept up my momentum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pieterse has raced a carefully calibrated cyclocross campaign and seems to be peaking for January and the World Championships in Li√©vin, France.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting better and better,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll take my form to the National Championships, a training camp and then the Worlds, of course.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following the long starting straight sprint effort, Van Empel led the riders into the first corner but Pieterse and Van der Heijden were also there as they hit the first climb and everyone ran up in the deep sand. Brand and Sanne Cant were also in the top five but the hierarchy soon emerged in the exposed dunes close to the North sea.</p>\n<p>Der Heijden and Pieterse opened a gap as every mistake in the sand cost riders precious seconds and speed. Brand was the first to lose contact, forced to run in the sand, with Van Empel also suffering.</p>\n<p> The two then began to swap places in the sand. Pieterse seemed far more in control in the sand and surged clear alone after Der Heijden came to a stop after a lap and a half. Even Pieterse made a few mistakes, taking the wrong line and hitting the barriers during the third lap.</p>\n<p>However she powered on alone as Van Empel and Brand caught Der Heijden. After 30 minutes and three laps of racing, they were 30 seconds down on Pieterse. </p>\n<p>Pieterse was out of sight to her rivals for much of the course. She was able to manage her effort and decide her best lines in the sand. Behind Brand found extra speed and determination to distance Van Empel and Der Heijden. </p>\n<p>She cut the gap to Pieterse but she faced a huge task.The bell rang out to signal the fifth and final lap as Pieterse crossed the exposed finish area. She was 20 seconds ahead of Brand, with Van Empel third at 25 seconds and Der Heijden just behind.</p>\n<p>Pieterse anticipated Brand&#8217;s fast finish and so never looked back or eased up.

However, as the penultimate lap drew to a close, Brand managed to open a small gap on a fading Vas.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Vos uses her skills and power to move up from her fifth-row start, to 15th place after one lap and in a battle for fourth place with Backstedt halfway through the race.  Vos chose to skip a couple of bike changes to try and get the advantage but in the end, Backstedt got the better, crossing the line two seconds ahead of the eight-time world champion for fourth place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17004&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17004&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of six season-long competitions. In contrary to the other competitions, the Ethias Cross does not award points or compose an overall ranking, but rather consists of separate races. Sponsored by the Belgian hardware chain Brico for the first three seasons and then by the Belgian insurance company Ethias from 2019 to 2022, its main sponsor is the enterprise software provider Exact.</p>\n<p>Marion Norbert Riberolle (Crelan-Corendon) came out on top in the fifth round of the Exact Cross series, the Azencross in Loenhout. The Belgian won solo to beat her teammate Sanne Cant to the win, her first cyclocross victory since the Exact Cross in Essen in October.</p>\n<p>Riberolle and Cant found themselves at the head of the race on the third of five laps, but it was 25-year-old Riberolle who raced to the finish first after taking advantage of a slower dismount by Cant on the penultimate lap.</p>\n<p>Cant eventually rolled across the line to take second place 23 seconds down. Back in the chase group, which had lost time ever since being distanced on lap three, it was Imogen Wolff (Visma-Lease A Bike) who rounded out the podium, 40 seconds down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I am super happy. I decided in consultation with my coach and the team to start here because it was a chance for a win,&#8221; Riberolle said after her win, according to WielerFlits. &#8220;However, I didn&#8217;t feel so good today during the recon. My legs were very heavy and it was not easy. I was also a bit too sleepy at the start.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a lot of respect for [Cant]. She used to be my idol. But in the final, I didn&#8217;t wait and I took my chances. For my morale, it&#8217;s very good that I can win here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nestled deep among the busy Christmas schedule, the Azencross was run between the UCI World Cup rounds in Gavere and Besan√ßon. As such, few of the world&#8217;s top-ranked riders were lining up at the start of the women&#8217;s race.</p>\n<p>The season&#8217;s top riders, Lucinda Brand, Fem van Empel and Ceylin Del Carmen Alvarado, were all missing, as were other major names including Puck Pieterse, Laura Verdonschot, Annemarie Worst, Z√∂e Backstedt, and Marie Schreiber.</p>\n<p>Still, there was plenty of competition for the win on a misty and near-freezing afternoon in Flanders.</p>\n<p>The opening lap saw an elite group hit the front of the race with former world champion Sanne Cant (Crelan-Corendon) joined by Lauren Molengraaf (Charles-Li√©geois Roastery), Larissa Hartog (Orange Babies), and Anna Kay (Proximus-Cyclis-Alphamotorhomes).</p>\n<p>The quartet pushed on to record a 10-minute opening lap, though more riders would work their way across before Cant and Kay pushed on alone.</p>\n<p>That two-woman move didn&#8217;t last long, either, though, with Cant hitting a deep rut in the mud midway through the lap and falling. Kay took evasive action, but before long the pair were caught by several others.</p>\n<p>Hartog, Marion Norbert Riberolle (Crelan-Corendon), Imogen Wolff (Visma-Lease A Bike), and Julie Brouwers (Charles-Li√©geois Roastery) caught on to make it six up front into what would be the third of five laps.</p>\n<p>The newly former status quo wouldn&#8217;t hold as Cant ventured off the front once more, this time solo. The Belgian champion&#8217;s teammate Riberolle was the woman who led the chase behind, and by the end of the lap she had soloed away from the rest and made it a Crelan-Corendon duo in the lead for the final two laps.</p>\n<p>Kay, Wolff, Hartog, Molengraaf, and Brouwers were in the battle for third place, though the group were well out of contention for the race victory.</p>\n<p>Up the road, Cant continued to lead Riberolle, with neither woman making a move from too far out. The leading order was reversed towards the end of the lap, however, with Riberolle getting the upper hand as the pair dismounted on a section of thick mud.</p>\n<p>Cant&#8217;s slowdown meant Riberolle was able to open up an eight-second gap as the bell rung to kick off the closing lap. A top-two spot was in the bag, at least, with the chasing group languishing 40 seconds off the lead.</p>\n<p>Wolff had led the group ahead of Kay for much of the pursuit, and she duly pulled away at the front on midway through the final lap of the race. Wolff secured third place at 40 seconds behind the winner, with Cant fading to finish second at 23 seconds down.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17101&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17101&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was a season-long cyclo-cross competition, organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), that took place between 24 November 2024 and 26 January 2025.</p>\n<p>World Champion Fem van Empel slogged her way through muddy, greasy conditions to victory in Gavere, going clear in the second lap to clinch a hard-won solo triumph.</p>\n<p>A training crash and knee injury had forced Van Empel to miss the preceding World Cup round, and she was a low-key seventh in her previous race at Namur.</p>\n<p>But the Dutchwoman was clearly back on top form in Gavere, going one better than her second place last year and claim her second World Cup victory last year.</p>\n<p>Second was Lucinda Brand, finally capable of going clear of 2023 Gavere winner Puck Pieterse after an epic duel behind the unstoppable Van Empel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every win is very important, but the last days were not easy for me,&#8221; Van Empel said afterwards, &#8220;But I showed my condition is good, so I&#8217;m really happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She agreed that the victory was important, too, to show that her knee was in good condition, saying &#8220;For now, yes, the running part was also good, so I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>71 riders got underway on a chilly, overcast day over the constantly undulating, very muddy course, but Van Empel was already into the lead after barely half a lap. Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), meanwhile, shadowed the Visma-Lease a Bike racer closely, grinding her way ahead of Blanka Vas (Canyon-SRAM) to make it look like a two-rider race from the get-go.</p>\n<p>As the two crossed the finish line for the first time, Van Empel and Pieterse had a 10-second advantage on Brand while the rest of the field were already further adrift. The two race leaders at this point looked to be evenly matched overall, Van Empel grinding her way steadily up the leafy, rutted climbs, while Pieterse seemed to be more nimble on some of the technical sections, but was slightly gapped on the longer hills.</p>\n<p>Fighting for traction on the slithery course, almost all the riders opted for a lot of bike changes given the perilously greasy conditions, but Van Empel nonetheless opted to open up the throttle even more. Thanks to that relentless increase in pace and pressure, towards the end of lap 2, Van Empel had eked out a 15-second gap on Pieterse, while Vas and Brand were engaged in a much closer duel for third. </p>\n<p>The going was so tough it made any advantage a brittle one, and a bike change by the Visma-Lease a Bike racer briefly squeezed back the gap between the two leaders on lap 3 of 5 to single digits. However, Van Empel then proved her superiority yet again as she made the most of gaining time on the ascents, going from strength to strength to increase her third-lap advantage to 22 seconds. Brand meanwhile, was able to drop Vas to gain a firmer hold on the provisional podium  &#8211; and perhaps go for more.</p>\n<p>A further fall for Pieterse complicated her chase, coming too hard into a right-hand corner, but she could continue unscathed. Brand, however, was looking to go up a podium spot and strengthen her advantage in the World Cup rankings, and she duly closed in steadily on Pieterse, finally power-slithering past the Alpecin-Fenix racer to move into second on one of the muddiest descents.</p>\n<p>Pieterse briefly regained the second spot thanks to some nifty line-picking, but Brand seemed to have the greater consistency on the ultra-demanding course. She eventually overhauled Pieterse again for a definitive runner&#8217;s up place and an even bigger overall advantage in the World Cup series.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile ahead Van Empel slogged onwards, though, picking up some lapped riders, and by the end of lap 4, her advantage on Brand had risen 33 seconds, with Pieterse at 41 seconds. Last year Gavere was where Van Empel had finally seen a run of 11 victories broken by Pieters. But this time round, from early on the 22-year-old had had the race in her grip and despite a minor fall on the final lap, she made it all the way to the finish line alone and ahead of the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"h https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15042&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15042&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Inge van der Heijden (Crelan-Corendon) was third at 59 seconds.  Sanne Cant was fourth. </p>\n<p>After four laps, Alvarado opened a small gap and then took advantage of Lucinda Brand&#8217;s fall to extend her lead. The victory helped Alvarado consolidate her lead in the Superprestige. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúI heard that Brand had fallen, but she wasn‚Äôt running that far at that point, so I thought for sure she would still be able to catch up.

It was only a few seconds but she opened the gas and surged away to victory.</p>\n<p>That gave back-to-back victories for Alvarado and four out of five wins in the Superprestige series.

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>The 2024 UCI Road World Championships witnessed history in the making on Sunday as Tadej Pogaƒçar became the first rider in 37 years to follow up this season&#8217;s victories in the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Tour de France with a gold medal and the rainbow jersey in the elite men&#8217;s road race.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian claimed cycling&#8217;s Triple Crown in devastating style, breaking away from the main peloton with 100 kilometres to go, blasting through a 16-rider move then going solo some 50 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked briefly to be in trouble as his gap dipped below 40 seconds on the final lap, but he still remained clear for Slovenia&#8217;s first ever road race gold medal, his 23rd win of the 2024 season, and another giant step towards becoming a legend of the sport.</p>\n<p>The silver medal went to late attacker Ben O&#8217;Connor (Australia), crossing the line 31 seconds behind, with defending champion Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) then claiming the bronze.</p>\n<p>But in one of the most stunning World Championships rides in the race&#8217;s history, the day in cycling, the year and perhaps even the decade all belonged to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe what just happened, after this kind of season, I put a lot of pressure on myself for today. I had pressure from myself, from the team, we came here for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race unfolded pretty quick and there was a dangerous break in the front, I maybe did a stupid attack, luckily Jan [Tratnik] was there with me and I never gave up until the final. It&#8217;s an incredible day, I can&#8217;t believe what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar confirmed that his attack at 100 kilometres to go, an enormous distance even by the Slovenian&#8217;s standards, had not been planned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course,it was not planned. We had planned to keep race under control but the race went quite early and I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking and I just went also, I went with the flow and luckily I made it, but it was so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure I wanted this title, after many years fighting for the Tour de France and other races, I never had a World Championships as a pure goal, and this year everything went smoothly already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a perfect season, this was a big goal to win the World Championships and I can&#8217;t believe it happened, I have to thank the whole team, without them it would not have been possible and I&#8217;m super proud of the national team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nJust as in the elite women&#8217;s equivalent event, at the start in Winterthur a minute&#8217;s silence was held in memory of Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died from injuries incurred in a crash in Thursday&#8217;s race. Once again, too, the Swiss team stood at the front of the bunch during the brief but moving ceremony. Then the flag dropped and after a thankfully short neutralized section on the typically drawn-out Worlds course, racing on a dry, cool day got underway.</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 kilometres, when it came to the early break nothing seemed to be sticking. But at last a concerted effort went clear with local hero Silvan Dillier (Switzerland), Luc Wirtgen (Luxembourg), and Piotr Pekala (Poland) receiving further valuable reinforcements in the shape of former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Norway), Rui Oliveira (Portugal), Simon Geschke (Germany), Markus Pajur (Estonia) and Roberto Carlos Gonzalez (Panama). Pajur and Gonzalez started struggling almost immediately, but more than enough firepower and variety in talent remained amongst the half-dozen breakaways to handle the dauntingly difficult terrain that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>In a largely uneventful opening segment, a small crash for Pello Bilbao (Spain) into a farmyard fence saw the veteran outsider in some pain but able to continue. However, the same was not true of Julian Alaphilippe, whose hopes of a record-equalling third rainbow jersey ended prematurely when the Frenchman fell and had to quit even before the race had reached the finishing circuit around Zurich.</p>\n<p>Then for over an hour a holding pattern emerged, with Victor Campenaerts and Jan Tratnik, working for Belgium and Slovenia respectively, keeping the half-dozen ahead under control at around four minutes. There was no sign of the Netherlands though, despite their fielding the third big favourite of the day, defending champion Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>Finally Pablo Castrillo, the recent double Vuelta a a Espa√±a stage winner, made the first attack from the quiescent pack on the seven laps of the Zurich circuit. Castrillo rapidly self-combusted, but his brief dig contrasted sharply with the much more insistent drive that followed by ten other dangerously strong riders and nations: Jay Vine (Australia), Laurens De Plus (Belgium), Stevie Williams (GB), Kevin Vermaerke (USA), Magnus Cort (Denmark), Matteo Cattaneo (Italy), Johannes Staune-Mittet (Norway), Florian Lipowitz (Germany) Pavel Sivakov (France) and Slovenia&#8217;s Tratnik.</p>\n<p>Logically enough given their leaders and two top favourites were still safely in the peloton, neither Slovenia nor Belgium were prepared to work in the break. The key question was, perhaps, who would be willing to spearhead the pursuit in the bunch behind &#8211; and the initial answer was &#8216;nobody&#8217;, allowing the 10 counter-attackers rapidly to carve open a promising gap of over three minutes.</p>\n<p> The &#8216;who&#8217;ll blink first&#8217; strategy continued in the pack far longer than expected, and with four 26.9-kilometre laps to go, the two breaks fused, creating a lead 16-man group. A concerted, if belated, response by Denmark, Spain and the USA in the peloton dampened feelings amongst some TV commentators that the winner was now bound to be coming from the front group. Then when Slovenia also opted to chase with Domen Novak behind despite having Tratnik ahead, it was clear that something much more serious was still brewing in the pack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the attack</strong><br />\nAnd so what proved to be the race&#8217;s defining moment suddenly hove into view. Pogaƒçar himself opted to make a move, blasting up the right side of a draggy climb at the jaw-dropping distance of just over 100 kilometres to go. Andrea Bagioli (Italy) was the only one to briefly follow him as Pogaƒçar yelled at Slovenian roadside team staff to tell him the gap on his chasers. But by the time Tratnik dropped back to tow the Slovenian up to the break, the Italian was long out of the duo&#8217;s rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Conventional thinking suggested Pogaƒçar&#8217;s audacious move was too early, even with memories of his 81-kilometre charge away at Strade Bianche and numerous other long-distance attacks to justify it. Certainly no-one could possibly have anticipated such a bid for victory, made at a moment when none of the favourites had even begun to start to think about attacking. But as has been proved time and again by Pogaƒçar in bike races, conventional thinking just does not apply to the Slovenian&#8217;s way of racing, and at the 2024 Worlds he was to prove that to a game-changing new limit.</p>\n<p>Reckless or not, Belgium were understandably extremely troubled by the Slovenian&#8217;s disappearance up the road, driving hard in the bunch to try and reduce the gap. The Belgians would likely have been even more worried to learn that as soon as Pogaƒçar reached the break ahead with Tratnik as his escort, he then made it clear he meant business by briefly clipping off the front of the race. However, even for a rider as exceptional as the Slovenian, going solo at 90 kilometres from the finish was perhaps too ambitious a move and he eased back into the group of 16 again.</p>\n<p>The gap was hovering at just over a minute at 83 kilometres to go as Tratnik delivered some textbook tactics to a highly unusual race scenario and unsurprisingly rode himself into the ground for his leader. When the 17 powered through the long finishing straight at the start of the third last lap the peloton could see the break ahead. But even the gap of 40 seconds was proving very hard to wear down. Only when the Dutch finally showed their hand did that advantage begin to shrink, just as Pogaƒçar yelled at Tratnik to make another all-out effort &#8211; before blasting off again.</p>\n<p>This time only Pavel Sivakov (France) was able to hold on at first, but even he had to lose Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel on the steepest part of the Zurichbergstrasse. Once across the top, though, the Slovenian wisely opted to wait for Sivakov, knowing that even for a giant of the sport like himself, attacking in a Worlds alone with 77 kilometres to go was the most daunting of tasks. The pressure of his repeated attacks, though, was such that in the peloton the </p>\n<p>Belgian team was at the risk of blowing up, with Evenepoel down to just one rider, Maxim van Gils and the Netherlands only chasing with Bauke Mollema. And so the two-hour, almost completely futile, history of trying to chase down a Pogaƒçar on the rampage began, with first Evenepoel hitting the panic button twice in person in quick succession. </p>\n<p>His double move had little effect apart from reducing the chase group to 35 riders, but Pogaƒçar, meanwhile, was steadily maintaining a gap of 45 seconds. That small gap might have been bigger, but the Slovenian&#8217;s constant glances behind meant he knew that fellow breakaway Sivakov could provide some more valuable support for a little longer &#8211; and, equally, that his long-term plan of keeping his pursuers at bay was working out just fine.</p>\n<p>It was not as if the chasers were giving up the ghost completely. Van der Poel put in one acceleration after another and then Evenepoel himself, too, pushed hard on the downhill to try and keep his Worlds hope alight. However, the most promising chase group turned out to be formed by Ben Healy (Ireland), Toms Skujins (Latvia) and Oscar Onley (GB), reducing Pogaƒçar and Sivakov&#8217;s advantage to 40 seconds, with Van der Poel and a visibly frustrated Evenepoel trailing along some 20 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was still arguably too narrow for comfort, though, and certainly not enough for Pogaƒçar to count on much-needed support from a team car. And so it was that with 50.5 kilometres to go when Pogaƒçar simply maintained his pace on the steepest climb of all, the Zurichbergstrasse for Sivakov the pace set down by his trade teammate was just too much, and the longest winning solo breakaway in the World Championships since 1971 began. Yet again &#8211; just like in Strade Bianche, just like in Li√®ge, and just like in the Giro and Tour &#8211; Pogaƒçar was out front alone and in a class of his own.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was brave enough to try at one point to make a lone counter-attack, catching a flagging Onley, while Skujins and Healy were working well together, even sharing bottles in their tenacious pursuit. But while Pogaƒçar still briefly looked concerned and waved an arm after missing one bidon with a gel attached at a feed, even with an hour&#8217;s racing remaining and 220 kilometres in his legs, increasingly it seemed as if he only had himself to beat.</p>\n<p>With 35 kilometres to go, the sense of resignation in the chasers was palpable. Given Pogaƒçar&#8217;s advantage stood at 1:02 as the lap-to-go bell rang out and with no-one showing the remotest sign of putting on a last-minute counter-attack, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s victory felt all but a foregone conclusion. A twist in the tale</p>\n<p>However, there was almost a final twist in the tail of major proportions as on a day with over 4,000 metres of vertical climbing and after a breakaway of historic proportions, even a giant like Pogaƒçar began to struggle slightly on the final lap. There was a second major wobble downwards in his time gap as Marc Hirschi (Switzerland) made a devastating counter-attack and suddenly, just as his triumph had seemed inevitable and for the first time in three hours, Pogaƒçar looked vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Hirschi was joined by Mas, the two then regained contact with Healy and Skujins and their numbers swelled further to Evenepoel, Van der Poel and O&#8217;Connor. Suddenly it was one rider ahead against seven behind and as the gap dropped even further to a nerve-wracking 39 seconds, the Slovenian staff waiting at the finish line began looking increasingly worried Yet for all a fast-recovering Evenepoel continued to chase, on a crucial little kicker on the long last downhill, Pogaƒçar abruptly overcame his tiredness and in a trademark flurry of pedal-turning, opened up his gap to 50 seconds again. </p>\n<p>With that extra time cushion and despite a searing late attack by Skujins and another by Healy, one further factor counted in his favour: behind the hesitations and changes of pace remained a constant, making it much harder for any sustained pursuit. </p>\n<p>So at long last and after one of the most memorable rides in Worlds history, Pogaƒçar could finally celebrate a milestone achievement in the sport, punching the sky in delight as he celebrated his first road race gold medal. Just when it seemed like the Slovenian could not set the bar even higher, he has done so &#8211; and after winning cycling&#8217;s two toughest Grand Tours in a single season, the most arduous, unpredictable, one-day race of them all is now in his palmares as well. ends</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>The 2024 UCI Road World Championships witnessed history in the making on Sunday as Tadej Pogaƒçar became the first rider in 37 years to follow up this season&#8217;s victories in the Giro d&#8217;Italia, Tour de France with a gold medal and the rainbow jersey in the elite men&#8217;s road race.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian claimed cycling&#8217;s Triple Crown in devastating style, breaking away from the main peloton with 100 kilometres to go, blasting through a 16-rider move then going solo some 50 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar looked briefly to be in trouble as his gap dipped below 40 seconds on the final lap, but he still remained clear for Slovenia&#8217;s first ever road race gold medal, his 23rd win of the 2024 season, and another giant step towards becoming a legend of the sport.</p>\n<p>The silver medal went to late attacker Ben O&#8217;Connor (Australia), crossing the line 31 seconds behind, with defending champion Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) then claiming the bronze.</p>\n<p>But in one of the most stunning World Championships rides in the race&#8217;s history, the day in cycling, the year and perhaps even the decade all belonged to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot believe what just happened, after this kind of season, I put a lot of pressure on myself for today. I had pressure from myself, from the team, we came here for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race unfolded pretty quick and there was a dangerous break in the front, I maybe did a stupid attack, luckily Jan [Tratnik] was there with me and I never gave up until the final. It&#8217;s an incredible day, I can&#8217;t believe what happened.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar confirmed that his attack at 100 kilometres to go, an enormous distance even by the Slovenian&#8217;s standards, had not been planned.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course,it was not planned. We had planned to keep race under control but the race went quite early and I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking and I just went also, I went with the flow and luckily I made it, but it was so tough.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure I wanted this title, after many years fighting for the Tour de France and other races, I never had a World Championships as a pure goal, and this year everything went smoothly already.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a perfect season, this was a big goal to win the World Championships and I can&#8217;t believe it happened, I have to thank the whole team, without them it would not have been possible and I&#8217;m super proud of the national team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nJust as in the elite women&#8217;s equivalent event, at the start in Winterthur a minute&#8217;s silence was held in memory of Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died from injuries incurred in a crash in Thursday&#8217;s race. Once again, too, the Swiss team stood at the front of the bunch during the brief but moving ceremony. Then the flag dropped and after a thankfully short neutralized section on the typically drawn-out Worlds course, racing on a dry, cool day got underway.</p>\n<p>For nearly 40 kilometres, when it came to the early break nothing seemed to be sticking. But at last a concerted effort went clear with local hero Silvan Dillier (Switzerland), Luc Wirtgen (Luxembourg), and Piotr Pekala (Poland) receiving further valuable reinforcements in the shape of former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Norway), Rui Oliveira (Portugal), Simon Geschke (Germany), Markus Pajur (Estonia) and Roberto Carlos Gonzalez (Panama). Pajur and Gonzalez started struggling almost immediately, but more than enough firepower and variety in talent remained amongst the half-dozen breakaways to handle the dauntingly difficult terrain that lay ahead.</p>\n<p>In a largely uneventful opening segment, a small crash for Pello Bilbao (Spain) into a farmyard fence saw the veteran outsider in some pain but able to continue. However, the same was not true of Julian Alaphilippe, whose hopes of a record-equalling third rainbow jersey ended prematurely when the Frenchman fell and had to quit even before the race had reached the finishing circuit around Zurich.</p>\n<p>Then for over an hour a holding pattern emerged, with Victor Campenaerts and Jan Tratnik, working for Belgium and Slovenia respectively, keeping the half-dozen ahead under control at around four minutes. There was no sign of the Netherlands though, despite their fielding the third big favourite of the day, defending champion Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>Finally Pablo Castrillo, the recent double Vuelta a a Espa√±a stage winner, made the first attack from the quiescent pack on the seven laps of the Zurich circuit. Castrillo rapidly self-combusted, but his brief dig contrasted sharply with the much more insistent drive that followed by ten other dangerously strong riders and nations: Jay Vine (Australia), Laurens De Plus (Belgium), Stevie Williams (GB), Kevin Vermaerke (USA), Magnus Cort (Denmark), Matteo Cattaneo (Italy), Johannes Staune-Mittet (Norway), Florian Lipowitz (Germany) Pavel Sivakov (France) and Slovenia&#8217;s Tratnik.</p>\n<p>Logically enough given their leaders and two top favourites were still safely in the peloton, neither Slovenia nor Belgium were prepared to work in the break. The key question was, perhaps, who would be willing to spearhead the pursuit in the bunch behind &#8211; and the initial answer was &#8216;nobody&#8217;, allowing the 10 counter-attackers rapidly to carve open a promising gap of over three minutes.</p>\n<p> The &#8216;who&#8217;ll blink first&#8217; strategy continued in the pack far longer than expected, and with four 26.9-kilometre laps to go, the two breaks fused, creating a lead 16-man group. A concerted, if belated, response by Denmark, Spain and the USA in the peloton dampened feelings amongst some TV commentators that the winner was now bound to be coming from the front group. Then when Slovenia also opted to chase with Domen Novak behind despite having Tratnik ahead, it was clear that something much more serious was still brewing in the pack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the attack</strong><br />\nAnd so what proved to be the race&#8217;s defining moment suddenly hove into view. Pogaƒçar himself opted to make a move, blasting up the right side of a draggy climb at the jaw-dropping distance of just over 100 kilometres to go. Andrea Bagioli (Italy) was the only one to briefly follow him as Pogaƒçar yelled at Slovenian roadside team staff to tell him the gap on his chasers. But by the time Tratnik dropped back to tow the Slovenian up to the break, the Italian was long out of the duo&#8217;s rear-view mirror.</p>\n<p>Conventional thinking suggested Pogaƒçar&#8217;s audacious move was too early, even with memories of his 81-kilometre charge away at Strade Bianche and numerous other long-distance attacks to justify it. Certainly no-one could possibly have anticipated such a bid for victory, made at a moment when none of the favourites had even begun to start to think about attacking. But as has been proved time and again by Pogaƒçar in bike races, conventional thinking just does not apply to the Slovenian&#8217;s way of racing, and at the 2024 Worlds he was to prove that to a game-changing new limit.</p>\n<p>Reckless or not, Belgium were understandably extremely troubled by the Slovenian&#8217;s disappearance up the road, driving hard in the bunch to try and reduce the gap. The Belgians would likely have been even more worried to learn that as soon as Pogaƒçar reached the break ahead with Tratnik as his escort, he then made it clear he meant business by briefly clipping off the front of the race. However, even for a rider as exceptional as the Slovenian, going solo at 90 kilometres from the finish was perhaps too ambitious a move and he eased back into the group of 16 again.</p>\n<p>The gap was hovering at just over a minute at 83 kilometres to go as Tratnik delivered some textbook tactics to a highly unusual race scenario and unsurprisingly rode himself into the ground for his leader. When the 17 powered through the long finishing straight at the start of the third last lap the peloton could see the break ahead. But even the gap of 40 seconds was proving very hard to wear down. Only when the Dutch finally showed their hand did that advantage begin to shrink, just as Pogaƒçar yelled at Tratnik to make another all-out effort &#8211; before blasting off again.</p>\n<p>This time only Pavel Sivakov (France) was able to hold on at first, but even he had to lose Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel on the steepest part of the Zurichbergstrasse. Once across the top, though, the Slovenian wisely opted to wait for Sivakov, knowing that even for a giant of the sport like himself, attacking in a Worlds alone with 77 kilometres to go was the most daunting of tasks. The pressure of his repeated attacks, though, was such that in the peloton the </p>\n<p>Belgian team was at the risk of blowing up, with Evenepoel down to just one rider, Maxim van Gils and the Netherlands only chasing with Bauke Mollema. And so the two-hour, almost completely futile, history of trying to chase down a Pogaƒçar on the rampage began, with first Evenepoel hitting the panic button twice in person in quick succession. </p>\n<p>His double move had little effect apart from reducing the chase group to 35 riders, but Pogaƒçar, meanwhile, was steadily maintaining a gap of 45 seconds. That small gap might have been bigger, but the Slovenian&#8217;s constant glances behind meant he knew that fellow breakaway Sivakov could provide some more valuable support for a little longer &#8211; and, equally, that his long-term plan of keeping his pursuers at bay was working out just fine.</p>\n<p>It was not as if the chasers were giving up the ghost completely. Van der Poel put in one acceleration after another and then Evenepoel himself, too, pushed hard on the downhill to try and keep his Worlds hope alight. However, the most promising chase group turned out to be formed by Ben Healy (Ireland), Toms Skujins (Latvia) and Oscar Onley (GB), reducing Pogaƒçar and Sivakov&#8217;s advantage to 40 seconds, with Van der Poel and a visibly frustrated Evenepoel trailing along some 20 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was still arguably too narrow for comfort, though, and certainly not enough for Pogaƒçar to count on much-needed support from a team car. And so it was that with 50.5 kilometres to go when Pogaƒçar simply maintained his pace on the steepest climb of all, the Zurichbergstrasse for Sivakov the pace set down by his trade teammate was just too much, and the longest winning solo breakaway in the World Championships since 1971 began. Yet again &#8211; just like in Strade Bianche, just like in Li√®ge, and just like in the Giro and Tour &#8211; Pogaƒçar was out front alone and in a class of his own.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel was brave enough to try at one point to make a lone counter-attack, catching a flagging Onley, while Skujins and Healy were working well together, even sharing bottles in their tenacious pursuit. But while Pogaƒçar still briefly looked concerned and waved an arm after missing one bidon with a gel attached at a feed, even with an hour&#8217;s racing remaining and 220 kilometres in his legs, increasingly it seemed as if he only had himself to beat.</p>\n<p>With 35 kilometres to go, the sense of resignation in the chasers was palpable. Given Pogaƒçar&#8217;s advantage stood at 1:02 as the lap-to-go bell rang out and with no-one showing the remotest sign of putting on a last-minute counter-attack, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s victory felt all but a foregone conclusion. A twist in the tale</p>\n<p>However, there was almost a final twist in the tail of major proportions as on a day with over 4,000 metres of vertical climbing and after a breakaway of historic proportions, even a giant like Pogaƒçar began to struggle slightly on the final lap. There was a second major wobble downwards in his time gap as Marc Hirschi (Switzerland) made a devastating counter-attack and suddenly, just as his triumph had seemed inevitable and for the first time in three hours, Pogaƒçar looked vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Hirschi was joined by Mas, the two then regained contact with Healy and Skujins and their numbers swelled further to Evenepoel, Van der Poel and O&#8217;Connor. Suddenly it was one rider ahead against seven behind and as the gap dropped even further to a nerve-wracking 39 seconds, the Slovenian staff waiting at the finish line began looking increasingly worried Yet for all a fast-recovering Evenepoel continued to chase, on a crucial little kicker on the long last downhill, Pogaƒçar abruptly overcame his tiredness and in a trademark flurry of pedal-turning, opened up his gap to 50 seconds again. </p>\n<p>With that extra time cushion and despite a searing late attack by Skujins and another by Healy, one further factor counted in his favour: behind the hesitations and changes of pace remained a constant, making it much harder for any sustained pursuit. </p>\n<p>So at long last and after one of the most memorable rides in Worlds history, Pogaƒçar could finally celebrate a milestone achievement in the sport, punching the sky in delight as he celebrated his first road race gold medal. Just when it seemed like the Slovenian could not set the bar even higher, he has done so &#8211; and after winning cycling&#8217;s two toughest Grand Tours in a single season, the most arduous, unpredictable, one-day race of them all is now in his palmares as well. ends</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=26&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lotte Kopecky (Belgium) has successfully defended her 2023 rainbow jersey in the elite women&#8217;s road race at the World Championships in Zurich.</p>\n<p>Silver in a ferocious six-rider final bunch that decided the 154-kilometre race was Chlo√© Dygert (USA), with Italy&#8217;s Elisa Longo Borghini clinching the bronze. Puck Pieterse (Netherlands) claimed the under-23 women&#8217;s world title, finishing 13th from a chasing group at 3:00.</p>\n<p>Raced in atrocious weather conditions, the rain-soaked and demanding Championship was dominated by the Netherlands, with Demi Vollering driving a lead group clear on the final two climbs.</p>\n<p>But despite being in trouble earlier on, Kopecky maintained her calm and, having shadowed Vollering in the finale, remained firmly in contention.</p>\n<p>Longo Borghini led out the six-strong sprint for gold, only for Kopecky to come through to become the first rider to claim back-to-back elite women&#8217;s World Championships titles since Marianne Vos in 2012-2013.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a kind of disbelief, but first of all I want to pay my condolences to the family of Muriel,&#8221; Kopecky said afterwards, referring to Muriel Furrer, the Swiss junior who died as a result of her injuries incurred in Thursday&#8217;s road race &#8211; and to whom she dedicated her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the minute of silence at the start, seeing the Swiss riders crying, is something you just don&#8217;t want to see. I think it&#8217;s a very hard moment for them as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As for the race itself, the defending champion said &#8220;It&#8217;s for sure a win [I took] with my head.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a really annoying day because it was raining and it wasn&#8217;t warm, but on the climbs it was warm and then in the downhill you got so cold and I was freezing at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But then I tried to stay as calm as possible, on the steeper climb I didn&#8217;t have any troubles and then on the longer one in the final time when Demi went I had some difficulties.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I just tried to stay at my own pace and come back and in the end it was just a lot of mind games.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then it was just trying to stay as cool as possible and use my energy in the right moment. The Australian rider [Ruby Roseman-Gannon] came from the back, Demi reacted immediately and that was perfect for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe tragic loss of Furrer has left &#8211; and will leave &#8211;  an indelible mark on these World Championships and as Kopecky said, before the race a minute&#8217;s silence was held to honour the memory of the 18-year-old, with the Swiss team assembled at the front of the peloton underneath the starting gantry. </p>\n<p>Swiss rider Noemi Ruegg surely echoed the thoughts of many when she told Eurosport before the race, &#8220;We worked hard for this, we are trying to do our best and we will race with Muriel in our hearts and we will see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the flag dropped, a three-rider attack quickly formed in the incessant rain, containing Caroline Baur (Switzerland), Sara Martin (Spain) and Nina Berton (Luxembourg). Coming through the finish on the first of four 26.8-kilometre laps, the trio held an advantage of 30 seconds over a lead group already reduced to around half of the 198 starters. Baur and Martin both struggled on the toughest ramps of the painfully irregular Bergstrasse that almost immediately followed, though, leaving Berton ploughing a lone pathway ahead, and one which quickly fizzled out.</p>\n<p>The race&#8217;s next significant development came some 100 kilometres from the line thanks to a dangerous nine-strong move, sparked by Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) and Niamh Fisher-Black (New Zealand) with Sara Gigante (Australia), Soraya Paladin (Italy), Urska Zigart (Slovenia), Justine Ghekiere (Belgium), Elena Hartmann (Switzerland), Christine Majerus (Luxembourg) and Mie Bjorndal Ottestad (Norway) all following. Then when Franziska Koch (Germany) and Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands) bridged across, with so many top nations present, the move looked even more promising. But the grim reality was the absence of France, Spain and Poland meant it was hard for the 11 to gain any traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, a concerted pursuit by the Netherlands both reabsorbed the break and saw 2021 World Champion Elisa Balsamo squeezed out the back. Another stand-out name, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (France), was also already struggling. The key lesson from this early skirmishing, either way, was that the Dutch were planning to make the running, be it in creating breakaways or ruthlessly crushing them.</p>\n<p>As the rain teemed down relentlessly, the all-powerful Dutch &#8211; still with all seven riders present on the front at the halfway point &#8211;  continued to use their strength in depth to play the numbers game in support of leader Vollering. Mischa Bredewold was merciless when it came to squeezing down the bunch in the brutal conditions to 50 riders, three-times road rainbow jersey Marianne Vos and Riejanne Markus then took over and next Pauliena Rooijakkers continued to pile on the pain.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to matter when top Dutch names like Vos were showing signs of being in trouble, Vollering herself upped the pace on the second last lap of the race, and her relentless rhythm fleetingly reduced the front group to around a dozen.  Even when Vollering was not closing down attacks in person, her teammates Markus and Pieterse seemed permanently poised to close down any other moves. Nobody, it seemed, could escape the orange team&#8217;s clutches.</p>\n<p><strong>Change of tactics</strong><br />\nThe Dutch seemingly switched from their clampdown tactics, though, when Markus bolted away with only Tour de France mountains classification winner Justine Ghekiere (Belgium) in her wake. In theory, this would force the remaining contenders to chase. In practice, though, a ferocious and somewhat inexplicable acceleration by Vos, then Bredevold and Pieterse reduced their teammate Markus&#8217; and Gheikiere&#8217;s advantage to 25 seconds. </p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (Switzerland) then took over on a long, rain-soaked descent, allowing the seemingly indefatigable Vos to bridge across the much-reduced gap alongside Ruby Roseman-Gannon (Australia). Vos and Markus did take turns from thereon as they powered towards the finish line for a second last time, once again putting their rivals&#8217; ability to respond under severe scrutiny, as Vollering watched and waited. But would a gap of four riders of nearly a minute as the lap-to-go bell rang out prove to be enough?</p>\n<p>The answer came quickly enough as Markus continued to drive for Vos on the steeper segments of the Bergstrasse, while Vollering controlled the chasers all the way through to the fast drop down to the second main climb of the Wetzikon. Finally, a powerful acceleration by Liane Lippert (Germany) singlehandedly reduced the gap to a bridgable 35 seconds and five riders moved ahead: Kopecky, Chlo√© Dygert (USA), Kopecky, Longo Borghini, Vollering and Lippert herself.</p>\n<p>Having flown under the radar for so long, Longo Borghini then made a ferociously long acceleration, only for Vollering to reply. Kopecky, though could not answer and was left trailing to the point where it seemed like her options on a second World Championships title were completely lost.</p>\n<p>As Kopecky found a second wind, Vollering opened up the throttle in earnest, but her determination was quickly matched by Longo Borghini, with Roseman-Gannon emphatically shaking her head as she was invited to come through.  Meanwhile, a colossal effort by Chlo√© Dygert allowed her to regain contact at 14 kilometres to go as the small lead group ploughed through a flooded segment of road. Then in a race with multiple plot changes, a revived Kopecky also recovered enough to regain contact alongside Vos and Markus, making the Dutch the majority once again in a nine-rider group, but with their key rival present, too.</p>\n<p>On the second last climb of the day, a vicious little kicker 10 kilometres, anybody without a sprint in their legs simply had to make a move and Vollering ripped away at the highest speed possible. However, her move simply eliminated her teammates and Ghekiere and reduced the front group to six, while Kopecky&#8217;s turn of speed on the descent ensured that it stayed that way. </p>\n<p>A final drag before the three-kilometre flat run-in alongside Lake Zurich briefly pushed Roseman-Gannon and Dygert out of the running and Longo Borghini did her utmost with a sustained late attack to ensure she kept the group at four. However, Vollering&#8217;s driving response tilted the battle back in favour of the chasers again, and then the last-minute arrival of Dygert and Roseman-Gannon, almost in the final kilometre, made it six riders in search of three medals. </p>\n<p>Perhaps knowing she was the weakest in a sprint, Roseman-Gannon began the charge for the line, only for Vollering to storm past. After her uneven race, though, a veteran track expert like Kopecky was now in her element on the flat finale, and she blasted through the centre of the tiny pack of riders to reclaim her rainbow jersey once again.</p>\n<p>While Kopecky made it clear that she had raced as much with her head as her legs on a difficult and uneven day, the USA also had considerable reason to celebrate, claiming their first silver medal in the event since Inga Thompson in 1991. After all their efforts, the Dutch, on the other hand, suffered a notable defeat with Vollering in fifth, even if gold for Puck Pieterse in the U23 category in the same event subsequently provided a significant consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Australian rider [Ruby Roseman-Gannon] came from the back, Demi reacted immediately and that was perfect for me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe tragic loss of Furrer has left &#8211; and will leave &#8211;  an indelible mark on these World Championships and as Kopecky said, before the race a minute&#8217;s silence was held to honour the memory of the 18-year-old, with the Swiss team assembled at the front of the peloton underneath the starting gantry. </p>\n<p>Swiss rider Noemi Ruegg surely echoed the thoughts of many when she told Eurosport before the race, &#8220;We worked hard for this, we are trying to do our best and we will race with Muriel in our hearts and we will see how it goes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>After the flag dropped, a three-rider attack quickly formed in the incessant rain, containing Caroline Baur (Switzerland), Sara Martin (Spain) and Nina Berton (Luxembourg). Coming through the finish on the first of four 26.8-kilometre laps, the trio held an advantage of 30 seconds over a lead group already reduced to around half of the 198 starters. Baur and Martin both struggled on the toughest ramps of the painfully irregular Bergstrasse that almost immediately followed, though, leaving Berton ploughing a lone pathway ahead, and one which quickly fizzled out.</p>\n<p>The race&#8217;s next significant development came some 100 kilometres from the line thanks to a dangerous nine-strong move, sparked by Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) and Niamh Fisher-Black (New Zealand) with Sara Gigante (Australia), Soraya Paladin (Italy), Urska Zigart (Slovenia), Justine Ghekiere (Belgium), Elena Hartmann (Switzerland), Christine Majerus (Luxembourg) and Mie Bjorndal Ottestad (Norway) all following. Then when Franziska Koch (Germany) and Mischa Bredewold (Netherlands) bridged across, with so many top nations present, the move looked even more promising. But the grim reality was the absence of France, Spain and Poland meant it was hard for the 11 to gain any traction.</p>\n<p>Finally, a concerted pursuit by the Netherlands both reabsorbed the break and saw 2021 World Champion Elisa Balsamo squeezed out the back. Another stand-out name, Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot (France), was also already struggling. The key lesson from this early skirmishing, either way, was that the Dutch were planning to make the running, be it in creating breakaways or ruthlessly crushing them.</p>\n<p>As the rain teemed down relentlessly, the all-powerful Dutch &#8211; still with all seven riders present on the front at the halfway point &#8211;  continued to use their strength in depth to play the numbers game in support of leader Vollering. Mischa Bredewold was merciless when it came to squeezing down the bunch in the brutal conditions to 50 riders, three-times road rainbow jersey Marianne Vos and Riejanne Markus then took over and next Pauliena Rooijakkers continued to pile on the pain.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t seem to matter when top Dutch names like Vos were showing signs of being in trouble, Vollering herself upped the pace on the second last lap of the race, and her relentless rhythm fleetingly reduced the front group to around a dozen.  Even when Vollering was not closing down attacks in person, her teammates Markus and Pieterse seemed permanently poised to close down any other moves. Nobody, it seemed, could escape the orange team&#8217;s clutches.</p>\n<p><strong>Change of tactics</strong><br />\nThe Dutch seemingly switched from their clampdown tactics, though, when Markus bolted away with only Tour de France mountains classification winner Justine Ghekiere (Belgium) in her wake. In theory, this would force the remaining contenders to chase. In practice, though, a ferocious and somewhat inexplicable acceleration by Vos, then Bredevold and Pieterse reduced their teammate Markus&#8217; and Gheikiere&#8217;s advantage to 25 seconds. </p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (Switzerland) then took over on a long, rain-soaked descent, allowing the seemingly indefatigable Vos to bridge across the much-reduced gap alongside Ruby Roseman-Gannon (Australia). Vos and Markus did take turns from thereon as they powered towards the finish line for a second last time, once again putting their rivals&#8217; ability to respond under severe scrutiny, as Vollering watched and waited. But would a gap of four riders of nearly a minute as the lap-to-go bell rang out prove to be enough?</p>\n<p>The answer came quickly enough as Markus continued to drive for Vos on the steeper segments of the Bergstrasse, while Vollering controlled the chasers all the way through to the fast drop down to the second main climb of the Wetzikon. Finally, a powerful acceleration by Liane Lippert (Germany) singlehandedly reduced the gap to a bridgable 35 seconds and five riders moved ahead: Kopecky, Chlo√© Dygert (USA), Kopecky, Longo Borghini, Vollering and Lippert herself.</p>\n<p>Having flown under the radar for so long, Longo Borghini then made a ferociously long acceleration, only for Vollering to reply. Kopecky, though could not answer and was left trailing to the point where it seemed like her options on a second World Championships title were completely lost.</p>\n<p>As Kopecky found a second wind, Vollering opened up the throttle in earnest, but her determination was quickly matched by Longo Borghini, with Roseman-Gannon emphatically shaking her head as she was invited to come through.  Meanwhile, a colossal effort by Chlo√© Dygert allowed her to regain contact at 14 kilometres to go as the small lead group ploughed through a flooded segment of road. Then in a race with multiple plot changes, a revived Kopecky also recovered enough to regain contact alongside Vos and Markus, making the Dutch the majority once again in a nine-rider group, but with their key rival present, too.</p>\n<p>On the second last climb of the day, a vicious little kicker 10 kilometres, anybody without a sprint in their legs simply had to make a move and Vollering ripped away at the highest speed possible. However, her move simply eliminated her teammates and Ghekiere and reduced the front group to six, while Kopecky&#8217;s turn of speed on the descent ensured that it stayed that way. </p>\n<p>A final drag before the three-kilometre flat run-in alongside Lake Zurich briefly pushed Roseman-Gannon and Dygert out of the running and Longo Borghini did her utmost with a sustained late attack to ensure she kept the group at four. However, Vollering&#8217;s driving response tilted the battle back in favour of the chasers again, and then the last-minute arrival of Dygert and Roseman-Gannon, almost in the final kilometre, made it six riders in search of three medals. </p>\n<p>Perhaps knowing she was the weakest in a sprint, Roseman-Gannon began the charge for the line, only for Vollering to storm past. After her uneven race, though, a veteran track expert like Kopecky was now in her element on the flat finale, and she blasted through the centre of the tiny pack of riders to reclaim her rainbow jersey once again.</p>\n<p>While Kopecky made it clear that she had raced as much with her head as her legs on a difficult and uneven day, the USA also had considerable reason to celebrate, claiming their first silver medal in the event since Inga Thompson in 1991. After all their efforts, the Dutch, on the other hand, suffered a notable defeat with Vollering in fifth, even if gold for Puck Pieterse in the U23 category in the same event subsequently provided a significant consolation prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9067&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Niklas Behrens (Germany) scored the rainbow jersey in the U23 men‚Äôs road race the UCI Road World Championships, outpacing Martin Svrƒçek (Slovakia) in a two-man sprint to the line in Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>The pair proved the strongest men from a select chase group behind long-distance solo attacker Jan Christen (Switzerland), who attacked alone 51km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Behind Christen, a group including Behrens, Svrƒçek, Jarno Widar (Belgium), Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) and Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain) formed after an attack from Widar, with the Belgian and his team responsible for much of the pacemaking behind the lone leader.</p>\n<p>On the final lap, Widar was once again leading the way and bringing the chase to within sight of Christen, at which point Behrens launched a powerful uphill attack. His jump at 11km to go brought both him and Svrƒçek across to Christen, with a second jump dispatching the Swiss rider for good.</p>\n<p>Behrens and Svrƒçek were off at the front, distancing the rest and extending their advantage past the 50-second mark before hitting the final kilometres and contesting the gold and silver medals.</p>\n<p>It was Svrƒçek who led out the sprint, with Behrens lurking until the final 150 metres before launching. The German‚Äôs power was too much for his Slovakian rival, netting him the rainbow jersey as U23 world champion.</p>\n<p>Christen, caught by the chase group behind 6km out, would eventually salvage fourth place at 39 seconds down having chased a late attack by Alec Segaert (Belgium). He had bridged across to the chase before quickly attacking solo 2km from the finish to secure the bronze medal, 28 seconds behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>The riders were unaware that 18-year-old Swiss rider Muriel Furrer died from the injuries she sustained in her Thursday crash during the junior women‚Äôs road because the UCI and the Zurich Worlds organising committee made the announcement during their race. </p>\n<p>Before the podium ceremony, a moment of silence was held, while flags were positioned at half mast in Muriel Furrer&#8217;s honour.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 173.6km race set the riders the same challenging circuit that has been contested at the other road races this week, with a 40km flat start giving way to four full laps of a hilly circuit around Z√ºrich.</p>\n<p>One climb of Binz (1.5km at 9.3%) and four ascents of Witikon (1.4km at 7.1%) proved the main challenges of the day, though numerous other hills and rises peppered the route, which totalled 2,400 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>Three riders attacked on the flat run to start the race, with Cole Kessler (United States), Lewis Bower (New Zealand) and Robert Donaldson (Great Britain) jumping away to a minute advantage as they entered the hilly finishing circuit for the first time.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Alastair Mackellar (Australia) attempted to bridge across, making a move at 125km out. He was caught in between the leaders and the peloton, however, before dropping back at the 120km mark.</p>\n<p>The three-man break out front wouldn‚Äôt last much longer, either, meaning the race crossed the finish line for the first time, with 108km left to run, with a slimmed-down peloton leading the way.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, on the climb up towards Witikon, Isaac Del Toro (Mexico) launched a stinging attack along with William Junior Lecerf (Belgium), though that would come to nothing. Attempts by Christen, Callum Thornley (Great Britain) and Artem Schmidt (United States) also gained little traction.</p>\n<p>The next time around, with just under 80km left to run, it was the turn of Antonio Morgado (Portugal) and Davide De Pretto (Italy) to try a move. Their unsuccessful break attempt was followed by the likes of Christen, again, as well as Tibor Del Grosso (Netherlands) and Giulio Pellizzari (Italy).</p>\n<p>However, a move wouldn‚Äôt stick until Christen tried for a third time, again on the uphill run to Witikon. At 51km from the finish he managed to get a gap on his rivals, striking out with just under two laps left to run.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the elite chase group that would be chasing him for much of the remainder of the race formed. Belgian riders Segaert and Lecerf had Jarno Widar, Robin Orins and Emiel Verstrynge for company in the group, along with Behrens, Svrƒçek, Del Toro, Pellizzari, Joseph Blackmore (Great Britain), Darren Rafferty (Ireland) and Spanish pair Igor Arrieta and Ivan Romeo.</p>\n<p>Pellizzari decided to venture out alone in the chase as Belgium unsurprisingly controlled the larger group. The Italian was brought back with 33km to go, while the group crossed the finish line to start the final lap 45 seconds behind Christen.</p>\n<p>It was the Belgians who had held the lone leader close by, and it was their man Widar who took the initiative on the final ascent to Witkon with a big move at the front. He took Svrƒçek and Segaert with him, though Del Toro, Blackmore and Del Grosso quickly made it across the gap.</p>\n<p>At the top of the hill, 20km from the line, Segaert and Del Grosso let go, while the work of Belgium and Widar had brought Christen‚Äôs advantage down to just 20 seconds. 18-year-old Widar continued to do much of the work in the chase, dragging the group to within sight of Christen as they raced into the final 15km.</p>\n<p>It was those who had kept more in reserve for the final who made the big moves, though, with Behrens and Svrƒçek powering past and across to Christen‚Äôs wheel 11km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Upon making the catch, Behrens immediately jumped again, distancing Christen as Svrƒçek stuck to his wheel. The pair would continue on to the finish, building their advantage up to almost a minute at one point before slowing in the final kilometre and contesting the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>Behind, Christen was caught by Widar, Blackmore and Del Toro with 6km to run, while a resurgent Segaert chased across and immediately went over the top 2km out. That move, coming after a brief rest in the wheels, was enough to push on secure bronze after the hard work of the Belgian squad.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=43&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Finn (Italy) soloed to the men&#8217;s junior road race world title in grim conditions in Z√ºrich, racing home from 20km out to score his nation‚Äôs first rainbow jersey of the UCI Road World Championships.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) secured the silver medal, crossing the line 2:05 after Finn. He rode solo for the final 13km of the race having dropped fellow chaser H√©ctor √Ålvarez (Spain).</p>\n<p>√Ålvarez, who was going backwards since being left behind by Finn‚Äôs winning move, was caught and passed by a small chase group in the closing kilometres, missing out on bronze in the process.</p>\n<p>Instead, the battle for third came down to a sprint between Senna Remijn (Netherlands), Paul Fietzke (Germany) and Ashlin Barry (United States), with the trio finishing in that order at 3:06 down. √Ålvarez, meanwhile, crossed the line in sixth 3:44 adrift of Finn.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt still hasn‚Äôt sunk in, to be honest. It still feels like a dream,‚Äù Finn said after the finish.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt amazing today, probably the best legs I‚Äôve ever had. When I went on my own the first time with 60km to go I was like ‚ÄòOh, this might be a bit early‚Äô. But then Philipsen and a few other guys bridged to me, and I just wanted to go full on the climb.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAlbert crashed behind me and I hope he‚Äôs OK. But once I was on my own, I knew I had it in the bag because I was feeling amazing.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI usually don‚Äôt like the rain, to be honest. I like 35 and sunny. But today was perfect.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The 17-year-old Finn ‚Äì reigning Italian junior road race and time trial champion ‚Äì had been at the head of affairs for 70km of the 127km race, 23km of it alone before he was brought back into an elite lead group 37km out.</p>\n<p>With the pouring rain and the hilly circuit taking their toll on the riders, the group whittled down until just four remained out front to contest the final. Only bad luck would intervene, too, with reigning champion Albert Withen Philipsen (Denmark) crashing out on a soaked corner 22km from home.</p>\n<p>That left Finn and √Ålvarez in the lead, but Finn, who had already spent plenty of energy in a solo move, had yet more left in the tank and dispatched with the Spaniard to race on alone into rainbows.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior men‚Äôs road race would take the peloton on a 127.2km journey from Uster to Z√ºrich, traversing 1,800 metres of climbing along the way. As in the junior women‚Äôs race, the climbs of Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) were the only major obstacles on the route, though the men would have to contend with three ascents of Witikon, taking them through the finish line three times before the crowning of the new world champion.</p>\n<p>The early stage of the race was, unsurprisingly, marked by numerous attacks as those from smaller nations ‚Äì including Azerbaijan ‚Äì attempted to get away. It was also marked by several crashes, including a sizeable one which caught out time trial silver medallist Jasper Schoofs (Belgium).</p>\n<p>The high pace of the start continued for 30km to Binz and past the day‚Äôs opening climb, with no breakaway establishing itself at the front as a result. Already just inside the 90km to go mark, the peloton had been obliterated, leaving only around 20 or so men in front.</p>\n<p>Attacks came and went on the approach to Witikon, including from Lorenzo Finn (Italy), Paul Fietzke (Germany), and H√©ctor √Ålvarez (Spain), leading the peloton to reduce in size once again.</p>\n<p>By this point, with 70km to go, names including time trial world champion Paul Seixas (France), reigning road world champion Albert Within Philipsen (Denmark), Matisse Van Kerckhove (Belgium), Sebastian Grindley (Great Britain) ‚Äì plus Finn, Fietzke and √Ålvarez ‚Äì were in the move.</p>\n<p>Withen Philipsen, Seixas and Van Kerckhove all gave it a nudge following the climb to Witikon, though none would get away. Instead, it was Finn who broke clear with an attack 60km out.</p>\n<p>On the way up to Witikon for the second time, Finn had gained 20 seconds, whereas the attacks and counters behind provoked another split. This time, Withen Philipsen, Seixas, Alvarez, Grindley and Senna Remijn (Netherlands) made the cut, leaving the rest of the group behind in pursuit of the lone leader.</p>\n<p>Finn held out well, however, maintaining a 25-second lead over the top of the climb and into the final 45km, while the dropped chasers lagged behind at 1:10. He held out until the 37km mark at least, at which point Withen Philipsen, Grindley and √Ålvarez bridged across having left behind Seixas and Remijn.</p>\n<p>With four in the lead versus two behind, the mathematics of the situation was always going to in favour of the quartet out front. So, it proved as they added second after second to their lead, crossing the finish line for the penultimate time 26km from home with a 35-seconds lead over the chase.</p>\n<p>The situation was quickly becoming even more positive for them, too, as Seixas struggled to keep up with Remijn. That seemed to liberate the Dutchman, if anything, as he swiftly set about closing the gap on the final run to Witikon.</p>\n<p>Now 25 seconds up the road, the lead group was busy blowing apart as Finn led Withen Philipsen then √Ålvarez, then Grindley on the short climb before Witikon. But the Dane‚Äôs race, and a chance at another rainbow jersey, was soon brought to an abrupt end as he crashed out on a wet corner.</p>\n<p>The fall left plenty of what-ifs about the race, and it also left √Ålvarez up with Finn in the lead with Grindley, Remijn and Seixas chasing one-by-one behind. That state of affairs didn‚Äôt last long either, for at the 20km mark Finn was off again, the Italian leaving Alvarez behind in search of victory.</p>\n<p>Finn was on a mission, his advantage swiftly ballooning out past a minute as he hit the 16km mark. √Ålvarez was struggling, and he soon had Grindley for company in a battle for silver. The pair would have to work together to hold off Remijn, but Grindley wasn‚Äôt content with a two-man battle for silver.</p>\n<p>Instead, he went for it on his own 13km from the line, with √Ålvarez unable to offer any resistance to the decisive silver medal move. Little would be seen of the Spaniard or the chase behind on the final run into Z√ºrich, but he wouldn‚Äôt hang on for the final medal placing. Instead dropping back behind Remijn, Fietzke and Ashlin Barry (United States), who sprinted it out for third.</p>\n<p>The day was Finn‚Äôs though, the Italian racing home with a mammoth two-minute gap, having clearly proved himself as the strongest man on the day and rounding off his efforts with the rainbow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=233&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=233&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The road race is the thing I&#8217;ve always wanted. Ever since last year, second place really hurt, so to get gold is incredible,&#8221; Ferguson said after the race, referring back to her silver medal in the Glasgow Worlds last summer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was conscious that I didn&#8217;t know how big the gap was. I had a good gap of a minute and a half with 5km to go but I knew that we slowed so much because nobody wanted to be on the front. So I kept looking back to check we weren&#8217;t going to get caught.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The race is so different [from the time trial and I focus so much on the road. I love the TT bike, but the road is the one I always wanted. It feels even better than Tuesday, which is insane to say because Tuesday was incredible.&#8221;<br />\nThe trio had been all set to contest the medal placings from the 20km to go marker, when they split away from a select lead group on the second and final major climb of the race, the Witikon.</p>\n<p>Clearly the strongest three women on the road, they steadily extended their gap over the chasers as they raced back towards Z√ºrich, sticking together on the soaking roads to the finish and finally enjoying an advantage of well over a minute.</p>\n<p>The final two kilometres brought caginess, checking over shoulders and cat-and-mouse games, but with plenty of time in hand, the trio could afford the slowdown. In the end, though, the final result was no surprise, with Ferguson duly outspeeding her two competitors for her second 2024 World Championships gold.</p>\n<p>Ortiz, having launched the sprint first, but only just hung on to take silver, edging out Chladonova by centimetres at the line. Fourth place was taken by Megan Arens (Netherlands) at just nine seconds down, the 17-year-old having used those final kilometres to close much of the minute-plus gap from the chasers on her own.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe junior women‚Äôs road race at the Road World Championships would see the peloton tackle a hilly 73.5km course from Uster to Z√ºrich. Two major climbs marked the route ‚Äì Binz (1.5km at 9.4%) and Witikon (1.4km at 7.2%) ‚Äì while the closing section was run on one-and-a-half laps of a closing circuit around the finish city.<br />\nThe race got underway in damp weather, though the conditions didn‚Äôt prevent riders from going on the attack early on.</p>\n<p>A breakaway wouldn‚Äôt go clear for 16km, however, at which point a group of five raced off the front. Arabella Blackburn (Great Britain) was joined in the lead by Nina Lavenu (France), Italian pair Eleonora La Bella and Silvia Milesi, and Weronika Wasaty (Poland).</p>\n<p>The move was kept on a tight leash by the peloton and the quintet would only last around 10km on the front before being brought back with 47km to run. Not long after that, a new group of attackers made a break for it as eight riders moved clear.<br />\nJunior time trial champion Cat Ferguson (Great Britain) was up there and she was joined by La Bella, her Italian teammate Giada Silo, C√©lia Gery (France), Megan Arens (Netherlands), Ostiz, Kamilla Aaseb√∏ (Norway), and Chlado≈àov√° .</p>\n<p>The group only held a slender lead of the peloton ‚Äì not more than 20 seconds ‚Äì meaning that chasers stood a chance of making it across.</p>\n<p>Imogen Wolff (Great Britain) and Eirini Papadimitriou (Greece) were among those to strike out from the chase, eventually bridging the gap as the race crossed the finish line for the first time at 27km to go.</p>\n<p>Their move made it nine up front, with La Bella having previously dropped away, likely the result of having been in two breakaway moves. The attacking and bridging all proved to be in vain, however, with the break and reduced peloton reunited at the 25km mark.</p>\n<p>On the uphill road towards Witikon, the Dutch team assumed control at the front, though it would prove impossible to stave off further attacks.</p>\n<p>Those moves saw a small group go clear at the front once more, with Ferguson and Wolff again up there along with Gery, Arens, Ostiz, Chladonov√°, and Silo.</p>\n<p>Wolff and Gery wouldn‚Äôt stick up front over the top of Witikon, though, and neither would Arens or Silo, as the trio of Ferguson, Ostiz and Chladonov√° pushed on ahead past the 20km marker.</p>\n<p>Pursued by Gery, Arens and Silo, the leading break quickly drew out an advantage of 40 seconds with 15 kilometres to go, while the next group on the road lay well out of contention at 1:30 down.</p>\n<p>It looked increasingly as though the lead group would contest the rainbow jersey and the medal placings among themselves, a prospect that was surely beyond doubt at the 10km mark, where the trio had over a minute in the bank.</p>\n<p>With 6km to run, at the end of the descent from the plateau following Witikon, they were 1:30 clear and ready to start thinking about the rainbow jersey. There was no poker from that far out, though, with the cat-and-mouse games not coming until they hit the 2km mark.</p>\n<p>There was constant checking over shoulders heading under the flamme rouge, with Arens having gone solo from the chase behind. There was little to worry about, however, with the rainbows all but assured for one of the leading trio.</p>\n<p>Ostiz and then Ferguson took to the front during the glacially paced final kilometre, but it was the Spanish 17-year-old who launched the sprint for the line first, just inside the 200-metre mark.</p>\n<p>Ferguson wasn‚Äôt caught out by the early jump, however, and was the first to react. Her closing speed proved more than enough to hold off Ortiz and the trailing Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àov√° to secure her second rainbow jersey of the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9070&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be held between 22 and 29 September 2024 in Zurich, Switzerland. It will be held alongside the UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships. A total of thirteen events were held, consisting of six road races, six individual time trials and a team time trial mixed relay (all of them finishing in Zurich in front of Sechsel√§utenplatz).</p>\n<p>A nail-bitingly tight three-way battle in the Road World Championships mixed relay team time trial on Wednesday saw Australia claim the victory by less than a second over Germany, with Italy clinching bronze, just eight seconds further behind.</p>\n<p>When the three top nations&#8217; riders entered the final quarter of an extremely long, remorselessly rugged course running across the hills around Zurich, they were still only separated by a scant five seconds in Australia&#8217;s favour.</p>\n<p>A last-ditch effort by Grace Brown, already a winner of the World&#8217;s individual time trial last Saturday and teammate Brodie Chapman then just managed to keep Australia atop of the results table by the finish by the tiniest of margins.</p>\n<p>Bronze medallists in 2023, Germany had the consolation of going one better in 2024 with silver, while Italy fell off the pace slightly in the final kilometre to finish eight seconds down and complete the podium &#8211;  but still well ahead of fourth-placed France, 23 seconds back, in one of the most dramatic TTs in recent Worlds history.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling a bit greedy, I need a few more rainbow jerseys in my closet,&#8221; Brown joked afterwards as she added a second World Championships title to the one she took last weekend, &#8220;but this one&#8217;s really got a nice vibe, to do it with the whole Aussie crew. It&#8217;s really exciting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Brown&#8217;s teammate Michael Matthews added, &#8220;It was a hard one. I think Jay [Vine] put me to the sword on that first climb, I think we averaged about 650 Watts from bottom to top, so it was a hard day and there was not much recovery.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So we had to stick together as much as possible and keep our speed as high as possible. We came through with the fastest time [at the first checkpoint] and then we knew we had a really strong women&#8217;s team to finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Team Time Trial Mixed Relay is a relatively new event, offering a chance for men and women to compete together, even if they ride in different moments, first as a trio of men and then as a trio of women. The times of the two teams are combined to decide the final results.</p>\n<p>Mongolia were the first of the 18 teams to get the ball rolling on the very selective, unforgiving 53.7-kilometre course, by far the longest in the Mixed Relay&#8217;s five-year history, and featuring nearly 1,000 metres of vertical climbing. Nearly all of the first wave of 10 squads immediately began losing riders as soon as the men tackled the short, punchy first ascent, the Witikonerstrasse, with Mohamed Islam Jorat and Qais Haidari (Afghanistan) both dropping behind teammate Ahmad Mirzaye. Mirzaye then had his own share of problems when he crashed through a fence, fortunately without injuries.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, China&#8217;s Lyu Xianging was visibly undecided about having to wait for compatriot Chengshuo Miao &#8211; which he eventually did &#8211;  and two Algerian riders had some sort of an on-bike disagreement about their lack of collaboration. Regardless of the course, on a difficult course, any such divisions, be they verbal or physical, inevitably came at a high price time-wise &#8211; and just as well it wasn&#8217;t raining. </p>\n<p>After the women&#8217;s half of the teams took over, China&#8217;s early best time of 1:23:39 was rapidly demolished by Ukraine, with a stunning result of 1:19:52. Only Estonia, 1:29 back, came anywhere close to their central European rivals, meaning Ukraine&#8217;s time was destined to stand as the initial target to beat for the second half of the competition. </p>\n<p>When the second, final, wave of eight teams began rolling down the ramps, despite losing Jonas Walton, Canada quickly upped the game at the first checkpoint (km11) with a provisional best time of 17:05 &#8211;  exactly a minute faster than Estonia. A super-strong USA trio including recent Vuelta a Espa√±a TT winner Brandon McNulty then pushed it even higher to 16:39, but the biggest hitters proved to be Germany, who went a full nine seconds faster, with Italy and Australia slotting in just behind.</p>\n<p>Double defending champion Switzerland suffered a major setback when Johan Jacobs was dropped less than five minutes into racing, almost certainly ruling them out of the medal battle. The German men, on the other hand, continued to go from strength to strength, blasting home in their half of the course in a top mark of 34:06 &#8211; only for a massive turn by Michael Matthews along the finishing straight in downtown Zurich to see Australia clock an even more impressive time of 33:44. </p>\n<p>Then there was yet more excitement as Italy pushed their way between Germany and leaders Australia, finishing just seven seconds down as their women&#8217;s trio of Elisa Longo Borghini, Soraya Paladin, and Gaia Realini took over. Gold then, was by no means out of reach for any of the first three teams atop of the results board at the half-way point, with France, just a second slower than Germany at the half-way point, still very much a medal contender as well.</p>\n<p>Fifth at the mid-way point, the USA women briefly claimed top time at checkpoint 3 (km 33) with a fine 54:28. But their time was kicked out of the park by Germany with 53:17, a massive 1:11 ahead, and despite losing Ruby Roseman-Gannon early on a climb, Australia steadied their own ship, too, to go five seconds faster.  Italy were only two seconds down on Australia, though, ensuring it would be a three-horse race for gold all the way to the line. France&#8217;s women, however, faded notably, leaving the podium &#8211; if not the order &#8211; all but decided.</p>\n<p>At the finish line, Germany blasted home at 1:12:53, more than two minutes ahead of the previous best Denmark. But it remained uncertain if that would be good enough to stand on top of the podium. Australia&#8217;s Brown and Chapman were giving it their all, though, on the flat final run-in that had already proved so critical to the men&#8217;s team effort, they just inched the German squad out of the top spot. It seemed incredible that there should be less than a second&#8217;s difference after such a tough 53-kilometre course between the top two teams, but the results board told a different story. But the cliffhanger finale had yet to reach a conclusion, as with a kilometre to go, TV images showed the Italians were still only a second behind the Australians.</p>\n<p>With their teammates and rivals all silently glued to the TV screens at the finish, as Italian duo Elisa Borghini and Gaia Realini closed in on the line, the tension could hardly have been any higher.  In the last 200 metres, though, the clock shifted in favour of the Australians and Germans, meaning the Italian team had to settle for bronze  &#8211; and a hugely entertaining time trial medals battle with the most uncertain of outcomes had finally been decided.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12533&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Although Kazakhsan&#8217;s Mariya Yelkina soon outstripped her by a second, both their times were eclipsed by the performance of Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àov√° who produced a stunning provisional best time of 24:24. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t do TT training very often, so it was a big surprise for me,&#8221; the Slovakian, recently a European TT medallist who also practices MTB and cyclo-cross, said afterwards. But her time proved to be more than enough to earn her a medal finish all the same. </p>\n<p>Despite going the fastest by a sixth of a second at the turn (km 9.4), a disappointed Imogen Wolf (GB) subsequently narrowly missed out on the Slovakian&#8217;s time, finishing two seconds behind after her power meter failed to work properly. Rider after rider then failed to impact on either time set by the Slovakian and Briton, even if several of the key favourites were yet to start. </p>\n<p>Double Dutch National TT Champion Fee Knaven fired a warning shot across their bows with the second best time at the turn, but she faded in the second half &#8211; eventually settling for fourth. However, it was a very different story for Britain&#8217;s Cat Ferguson, the last rider to start and widely viewed as a top contender. Already 14 seconds up on Chlado≈àov√° at the time split, Ferguson then more than doubled that advantage to continue her blistering final season as a Junior with a definitive winning margin of over 34 seconds -well clear of the rest of the field.</p>\n<p>Later explaining her stunning TT performance, Ferguson said one key to success on a course with just 36 metres of elevation gain was that she had maintained her pacing strategy throughout.   </p>\n<p>&#8220;I had my ride, stuck to the plan, it was a bit windier than I thought, I was getting blown around a little bit, so I tried to keep my head down as much as possible,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kept to a set of Watts and tried to do it throughout, going out was as hard as on the way back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ferguson also paid tribute to those who helped her claim her first Junior Worlds title, saying  &#8220;It was helpful to have my coach in my ear, guiding me through and having someone there to support you and back you is so nice.&#8221; Then when she reached the finish line with the gold medal a certainty, her parents were there to greet her as well. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been there throughout my career, so to have them here today was great,&#8221; she added.</p>\n<p>Ferguson is now set to start her first full pro season with Movistar in 2025, but with her TT triumph as one of her final Junior successes, her morale will surely be higher than ever as she embarks on the next stage of an already very promising career.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9069&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The event will consist of a total of 6 road races, 6 time trials, and 2 relays</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier of Belgium came from behind in a messy, hectic sprint to win the elite men&#8217;s road race title at the UEC Road European Championships in eastern Flanders.</p>\n<p>Belgium had opted for an unusual two-sprinter team tactic, with Merlier and Jasper Philipsen given the freedom to ride their own sprint.</p>\n<p>Philipsen managed to take the best line along the barriers but Merlier had far more speed and came along the outside. He soon got ahead of his rivals in sight of the line and had time to celebrate as Olav Kooij (Netherlands) took second and Madis Mihkels (Estonia) beat Philipsen to take third.</p>\n<p>Italy had controlled the attacks by Mathieu van der Poel (Netherlands) and Mads Pedersen (Denmark) during the 222km race and even led out the sprint only to be swamped in the final five hundred metres. Jonathan Milan struggled in the fight for the wheels and only finished 13th.</p>\n<p>Merlier took his 14th and arguably the biggest win of the 2024 season. He celebrated with his family and young son. He admitted that he lost his chain with three hundred metres to go but recovered in time to launch his winning sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;My chain came off with three hundred metres to go and I thought it was over. But I got going, found a gap and came out of the bunch at the right moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier confirmed that Belgium had a two-sprinter strategy because he was confident he could win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked to be in the race because I believed I could win the championship. I did it and I&#8217;m proud of it,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This jersey means a lot, after twice being the Belgian national champion. I said it was my last goal of the year. I&#8217;ve worked for this.

Mikkel Bjerg was also there for Denmark, while at the back, Tim Merlier had to chase after a puncture and roadside wheel change.</p>\n<p>After ten kilometres, a quality group of chasers joined the van der Poel group to form a dangerous attack.

Van der Poel wanted to be part of the action but missed the move, fortunately other riders closed the gap. The race came back together once again and Italy tried to control the peloton but more attacks came on the Op de Kriezel cobbled sector as the riders began the last lap of the circuit in south Limburg.</p>\n<p>With 55 km to go, Pedersen made another attack to try to split the peloton. Van der Poel jumped in with him again and so did Christophe Laporte of France and Danny van Poppel of the Netherlands. They did not want to wait for a sprint finish.</p>\n<p>However, Italy clearly did. Eduardo Affini used his time trial skills and domestique&#8217;s speed to chase, calling for Germany and Belgium to help him.

A crash split the peloton just before the Printhagendreef cobbled sector but the catch finally came with 26km to go, the chances of a high-speed sprint finish becoming more certain.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Italian team took control of the peloton to set the pace and dissuade other attacks on the ride to the finish.</p>\n<p>There were seven Azzurri on the front, only Mosca absent after working a lot earlier in the race.

He celebrated with his family and young son. He admitted that he lost his chain with three hundred metres to go but recovered in time to launch his winning sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;My chain came off with three hundred metres to go and I thought it was over. But I got going, found a gap and came out of the bunch at the right moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier confirmed that Belgium had a two-sprinter strategy because he was confident he could win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I asked to be in the race because I believed I could win the championship.

The peloton passed through the finish line for the first time just 27km into the race and then embarked on opening short circuits, a large loop and finishing circuits in Hasselt.</p>\n<p>There were six cobbled sectors on the course that added to the dynamics of the race along with four categorised ascents: Kolmontberg (700m at 4.4%) and Zammelenberg (800m at 3.8%), which were tackled a second time on the final lap of the large circuit, before entering the Hasselt finish circuits.</p>\n<p>There were several crashes, mechanicals and a flurry of attacks as the peloton departed from Heusden-Zolder but the field remained intact as they entered the first cobbled sectors of the race.</p>\n<p>The Dutch team with defending champion Mischa Bredewold managed the pace at the front of the field but after multiple attacks from riders on the Belgian and Spanish teams, and then a countermove from Nikola Noskov√° (Czech Republic), the field split with roughly 50 riders in the front group.</p>\n<p>Mireia Benito (Spain) was the first rider to gain any significant time on the peloton, led by the Dutch squad, pushing her lead out to 20 seconds ahead of the back-to-back climb over the Kolmontbberg and Zammelenberg on the first large circuit.</p>\n<p>Benito crested the two climbs and maintained a gap of 25 seconds over the peloton, while Jade Wiel (France) attempted to bridge across to the solo breakaway rider.

The event will consist of a total of 6 road races, 6 time trials, and 2 relays</p>\n<p>Huub Artz gave the Netherlands their fourth gold medal of the 2024 UEC Road European Championships in the U23 men&#8217;s road race, outsprinting Niklas Behrens (Germany) at the end of the 162km race in Hasselt. Frenchman L√©andre Lozouet rounded out the podium to take the bronze medal 10 seconds later.</p>\n<p>Artz, Behrens and Lozouet went away in the winning move with over 40km to go ahead of the day&#8217;s final climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg.</p>\n<p>Scattered chase groups behind looked at one point to be dragging back the 30-second gap the leaders enjoyed over the final climb, but there wasn&#8217;t enough strength or coordination behind to fully eat into the lead on the closing local laps.</p>\n<p>14km from the line, as the riders passed through the finish line for the penultimate time, just 20 seconds separated the leaders from the chase of Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg) and Fabian Weiss (Switzerland).</p>\n<p>However, that was as close as those behind would get to the front of the race, leaving the three up front to decide the medal positions. Inside the final 5km, Lozouet was forced to let go of gold and silver as Behrens attacked to leave him behind.</p>\n<p>Artz stuck with the German, however, and had enough in the sprint to just edge out the 20-year-old in the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing. I didn&#8217;t expect to win,&#8221; Artz said after taking the win. &#8220;I was thinking all week &#8216;How can I possibly win?&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We had a good group with three Dutch riders and then we went early with three of us but we were all strong riders. In the end, it would be a matter of who had the fastest legs and it was me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I said to my directeur sportif that I think it&#8217;ll be a sprint and I was waiting, waiting. In the end, the race broke open earlier than I thought. I&#8217;m happy that it turned out like this. It was perfect.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the time trialing over and done with at this year&#8217;s UEC Road European Championships, attention on Friday turned to the road races, with the U23 men tackling a 162km course between Heusden-Zolder and Hasselt after the U23 women had earlier opened the road racing action.</p>\n<p>The course featured six cobbled sectors including two major cobbled climbs. Two ascents of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg both came on two laps of a challenging Limburg circuit.</p>\n<p>Carl Kagevi (Sweden), Halvor Sandstad (Norway), Stian Rosenlund (Denmark), Julian Borresch (Germany), Mats Wenzel (Luxembourg), Roman Holzer (Switzerland) and Mateusz Gajdulewicz (Poland) formed the first breakaway of the day, but with the Belgian and Dutch teams controlling the pace, their lead never went much over half a minute.</p>\n<p>Once the race reached the Limburg circuit, another group got away with French trio Pierre Gautherat, Matys Grisel and L√©andre Lozouet joined by Dutch trio of Huub Artz, Tibor del Grosso and Jesse Kramer, as well as Rasmus S√∏jberg Pedersen (Denmark, Alessandro Borgo (Italy), Niklas Behrens (Germany), Fabian Weiss (Switzerland), Matyas Kopecky (Czechia), and Alexandre Kess (Luxembourg).</p>\n<p>The first climbs of the Kolmontberg and Zammelenberg sparked a counterattack of nine riders as the race reached the cobbles of Manshoven where Lozouet, Artz and Behrens got away from the leaders.</p>\n<p>With more cobbles lying ahead on the Kriezel, their lead grew over the 13 chasers ‚Äì Belgians Steffen De Schuyteneer and Sente Sentjens, plus Gautherat, Grisel, Del Groso, Kramer, Pedersen, Borgo, Christen, Weiss, Kopecky, Kess and Wenzel.</p>\n<p>On the Zammelenberg, the chase group lost Grisel, while the peloton behind was in tatters. With 35km to go, Wenzel and Weiss attacked to try to go across but struggled to close the gap, which held at just over 30 seconds at 20km to go.</p>\n<p>The second chase group featuring the Belgians was long gone and lay almost a minute further behind, with the peloton 2:30 from the leaders. Up front, the leading trio had plenty of work to do to hold off the chase behind, but with the closest groups splitting into ones and twos on the toughest sections of the course, they just had to keep working together.</p>\n<p>The leaders continued towards the finish holding a slim lead of never more than 30 seconds, but it proved to be enough to settle the race for the title as they fought amongst themselves during the closing circuit in Hasselt.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was Artz who prevailed in the sprint for the line, outpacing Behrens after the pair had distanced Lozouet a handful of kilometres away from the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=348&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The team, which also included Ilse Pluimers and Nienke Vinke, shut down attempted late attacks by several Italian riders as well as Julia Kopecky (Czechia) and Wilma Aintila (Finland) to ensure a bunch sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Belgium had attempted several moves to send riders clear once the early break of Mikka Holm (Denmark) and Nela Slanikova (Czechia) had been reeled in, though no big names managed to slip clear and disrupt the sprint.
