It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) soloed to victory on stage 9 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a, attacking near the base of the final 13km climb to win at the Valdezcaray ski station and draw closer to the red jersey.</p>\n<p>Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) outsprinted Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to take second and third, respectively after a valiant chase, 24 seconds behind the Dane, but making significant gains on their general classification rivals.</p>\n<p>Led out by Matteo Jorgenson, Vingegaard attacked just 2km into the climb, initially with Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) on his wheel, but went solo with 10km still to climb, and would never be seen again.</p>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of Almeida and Pidcock, who were within nine seconds of Vingegaard at one point, the Dane couldn&#8217;t be caught, and the chasers had to settle for podium spots.</p>\n<p>Red jersey Torstein Tr√¶en (Bahrain Victorious) finished in a group 1:46 down on Vingegaard, which means he will hold onto the race lead heading into the race&#8217;s first rest day.</p>\n<p>However, Jonas Vingegaard is now breathing down his neck, just 37 seconds down on GC and looking like the strongest rider in the race. Almeida moved up to third, 1:15 down on Tr√¶en, whilst Pidcock jumped from 11th to fourth at 1:35. The rest of the top 10 are a chunk down, with fifth-placed Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) 2:14 down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt super great today, and then on the last climb, I also felt really good, and I said to my team if they could speed up, and they did so I tried,&#8221; Vingegaard said at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They did super well. That was amazing teamwork, and I was really happy that I could finish it off. I couldn&#8217;t do it without them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, maybe I didn&#8217;t do my homework good enough because I thought it was closer to the finish when I attacked, and I was a bit surprised when I saw the 10-kilometre banner,&#8221; he said of his early move. &#8220;But at that moment I had the gap, and I had to keep going.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIt was an attacking start to the day as stage 9 rolled out of Alfaro, with various attempts to break away in the first 30km of racing, but no success for quite a while, with the peloton clearly picky about who they let up the road on a threatening day.</p>\n<p>Though there were no categorised climbs on route apart from the finish, there were plenty of hills to contend with, especially in the opening part of the stage, so there were many launchpads for riders to try and get away, making for a tough battle.</p>\n<p>It was over the top of one of these early climbs that a pair of riders did finally get away, with Michal Kwiatkowski (Ineos Grenadiers) and Archie Ryan (EF Education-EasyPost) breaking clear. On the descent, they were joined by Michel He√ümann (Movistar), Kevin Vermaerke (Picnic PostNL) and Liam Slock (Lotto), making it five up front. They built up a lead of just under three minutes, but were kept at a steady gap, with the peloton ‚Äì led by Lidl-Trek ‚Äì seemingly not wanting to just let the break sail away to the stage win.</p>\n<p>The situation remained stable through the first half of the stage, with the break 2:30 ahead with 80km to go, as Q36.5 joined Lidl-Trek in the controlling effort as the peloton declined to take it easy.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek continued pacing for the next 40km, gradually bringing the gap down, and with 40km the leaders ‚Äì who were working hard together ‚Äì were 1:44 ahead of the peloton. Lidl-Trek had some interest in bringing things back before the intermediate sprint with 29km to go, so Mads Pedersen could pick up some points, but in the end they didn&#8217;t make the catch soon enough. At the sprint, Slock took the win and the maximum points with his breakaway companions mopping up the remaining points.</p>\n<p>At that point, the gap was down to 1:15 as the 13km final climb loomed, with Lidl-Trek, Bahrain Victorious and Q36.5 continuing to work at the front of the bunch. The chase and the fight for position in the bunch heated up as the road ran into the base of the climb.</p>\n<p>With 15km to go, the leaders had just a 13-second advantage, but at the base of the climb, they were swallowed up by the charging peloton despite the best efforts of Kwiatkowski and Ryan. It was still Lidl-Trek who were setting the pace on the front of the bunch, having some of the same all day, though their rouleurs had swapped for the climbing contingent of Andrea Bagioli, Carlos Verona and Ciccone.</p>\n<p>However, it was Visma-Lease a Bike who struck first just 2km into the climb, with Matteo Jorgenson putting in a big move to pull Vingegaard and Ciccone clear, though the American soon pulled off ‚Äì after creating a healthy gap. The explosion of pace meant there was only a reduced chasing group behind, with red jersey Tr√¶en not part of it.</p>\n<p>With 10km to go, Vingegaard drew clear of Ciccone, but only nine seconds ahead of the chasing group, led by a charging Jo√£o Almeida. Almeida soon also ripped apart the chase group, with only Tom Pidcock and Felix Gall able to follow him, though the Austrian dropped with 7.5km to go. Pidcock and Almeida were working together, but Vingegaard had drawn out a lead of 22 seconds and growing.</p>\n<p>Pidcock and Almeida managed to not let the gap balloon in the final 5km, but ultimately couldn&#8217;t close it, leaving Vingegaard to solo to his second stage victory of the race. Sprinting 24 seconds behind the Dane, Pidcock just beat Almeida to second, as the pair made gains on GC.</p>\n<p>The next main group of riders finished 1:46 down, containing red jersey Tr√¶en, meaning he held onto the race lead, but he and the rest of that group lost a significant chunk of time of Vingegaard, Pidcock and Almeida going into the first rest day.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck&#8217;s Jasper Philipsen sprinted to victory on stage 8 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a, expertly navigating a chaotic finish to take the victory in Zaragoza.</p>\n<p>After missing out on stage 4, the race&#8217;s next sprint stage was a big goal for the Belgian, who started the stage as a clear favourite, and despite a messy, disorganised lead-out, he came past Elia Viviani (Lotto) at the final moment to claim the win.</p>\n<p>Viviani crossed the line in second place, just half a wheel behind Philipsen after leading towards the line, but was later relegated to 105th place.</p>\n<p>Ethan Vernan (Israel-Premier Tech) moved up to second place, and Arne Marit (Intermarch√©-Wanty) took third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We won, so we cannot complain,&#8221; Philipsen said after the win, despite being boxed in at points.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We lost my teammate, I think he did an incredible lead-out again but he was not there, and I tried to communicate, but it&#8217;s difficult in the last kilometre, and I had to find my way, take a bit of extra wind, and really come late because my legs were concrete. But I just managed to win, so I&#8217;m really happy, and the effort of the team has not been for nothing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This win marks Philipsen&#8217;s 15th Grand Tour stage win, after winning the opening stage of this Vuelta, though there aren&#8217;t many more opportunities in this race for the fast men.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Every Grand Tour win is always a special one, and it&#8217;s never easy. You suffer a lot of days in the mountains to get here. From now on it&#8217;s going to be a tough Vuelta, but with the win, that always makes it a bit more easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite wearing the green jersey, Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) failed to crack the top 10 on a stage that proved best-suited to the purest sprinters.</p>\n<p>A breakaway of three riders ‚Äì Sergio Samitier (Cofidis), Joan Bou (Caga Rural-Seguros RGA) and Jos√© Luis Faura (Burgos Burpellet BH) ‚Äì had been away all day, but were reeled in with 17km to go in advance of the sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Finishing in the bunch, Torstein Tr√¶en (Bahrain Victorious) retained the red jersey for another day with no notable changes on GC.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 8 of the Vuelta was completely flat for 163km, with not even a categorised climb in sight as all signs pointed towards a sprint finish. As a result of the relaxed parcours, there was also a fairly relaxed pace at the start of the day. A three-man breakaway was let away easily in the first 5km of racing, made up of Sergio Samitier (Cofidis), Joan Bou (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Jos√© Luis Faura (Burgos Burpellet BH).</p>\n<p>They quickly built up a lead of three minutes, and it was a very uneventful first 50km, with the peloton well down on even the slowest predicted schedule after the first couple of hours of racing.</p>\n<p>Through the middle part of the stage, the gap remained stable at around 3:15, as the leaders rode well together, and Alpecin-Deceuninck took up the job of controlling the pace on the front of the peloton, setting their intentions early.</p>\n<p>With 60km to go, the peloton began to ramp things up ever so slightly, with the time gap dipping below three minutes for the first time. With a technical lap concluding the stage, there was plenty of incentive to be near the front and organised well before the race arrived in Zaragoza for the first time with 23km to go.</p>\n<p>The gap then came down quite steadily, falling below two minutes with 45km to go, and the peloton picked up even more when the intermediate sprint approached, with a few points remaining for the peloton after the break took the top three spots. It was Mads Pedersen who just beat Ethan Vernon to the line, adding 13 points to his green jersey tally, though Philipsen did not get involved in the intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>With 30km to go, the gap was a minute and falling as the teams fanned across the roads on the way into Zaragoza and a first viewing of the final 3km before the sprint. With 24km to go, Faura was the first to lose contact with the breakaway as the other two escapees battled to hold on as long as possible.</p>\n<p>Behind, there was a fierce fight for position in the bunch, with the GC teams and sprint teams all lining up on the wide roads on the edge of the city. With 17km to go, both Samitier and Bou were caught, but it was still mainly the GC teams dominating the front of the bunch, with the sprint trains not going too early.</p>\n<p>Though the wide roads in the run-in gave plenty of space at first, it was still tense and fast, especially with the roads narrowing as the finish line got closer. Going into the last 8km, the sprint teams came more to the fore, with Alpecin and Lidl-Trek trying to stay out of the wind as long as possible and letting the likes of EF Education-EasyPost and Picnic PostNL do the work.</p>\n<p>Alpecin came to the front with 4km to go, but it was a tough battle for position in the finale, with it increasingly hard to stay organised, and the lead-out was markedly messy with Philipsen losing his last lead-out man fairly early. Instead, he had to surf the wheels himself, and for a while it looked like he may have been boxed out, but he found a way to the front to come around Viviani at just the last minute. The Italian held on for second whilst Vernon took third with sprinters spread all across the road.</p>\n<p>Pedersen suffered amongst the chaos, finishing 11th on the day, whilst stage 4 winner Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) took 10th despite the best lead-out efforts of Filippo Ganna. Many other sprinters were also crowded out in the messy finish, with riders like Casper van Uden (Picnic PostNL) and Tim van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) not even in the top 10 despite their teams&#8217; efforts.</p>\n<p>With all the GC favourites finishing in the bunch, there were no significant changes to the overall standings with Tr√¶en holding onto the red jersey for another day, though things are set to change as soon as Sunday, with a summit finish to come at the Valdezcaray ski station.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

With 17km to go, both Samitier and Bou were caught, but it was still mainly the GC teams dominating the front of the bunch, with the sprint trains not going too early.</p>\n<p>Though the wide roads in the run-in gave plenty of space at first, it was still tense and fast, especially with the roads narrowing as the finish line got closer. Going into the last 8km, the sprint teams came more to the fore, with Alpecin and Lidl-Trek trying to stay out of the wind as long as possible and letting the likes of EF Education-EasyPost and Picnic PostNL do the work.</p>\n<p>Alpecin came to the front with 4km to go, but it was a tough battle for position in the finale, with it increasingly hard to stay organised, and the lead-out was markedly messy with Philipsen losing his last lead-out man fairly early. Instead, he had to surf the wheels himself, and for a while it looked like he may have been boxed out, but he found a way to the front to come around Viviani at just the last minute. The Italian held on for second whilst Vernon took third with sprinters spread all across the road.</p>\n<p>Pedersen suffered amongst the chaos, finishing 11th on the day, whilst stage 4 winner Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) took 10th despite the best lead-out efforts of Filippo Ganna. Many other sprinters were also crowded out in the messy finish, with riders like Casper van Uden (Picnic PostNL) and Tim van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) not even in the top 10 despite their teams&#8217; efforts.</p>\n<p>With all the GC favourites finishing in the bunch, there were no significant changes to the overall standings with Tr√¶en holding onto the red jersey for another day, though things are set to change as soon as Sunday, with a summit finish to come at the Valdezcaray ski station.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Huesca La Magia : 188 km</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-34834\"></span><br />\nThe 2025 Vuelta a Espa√±a is a three-week cycling race taking place in Italy, France, Andorra and Spain. It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG tripled up at the Vuelta a Espa√±a on stage 7 as Juan Ayuso came back from an 11-minute time loss to win solo from the breakaway in Cerler.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard dropped out of the GC race after a challenging final climb in Andorra on Thursday, but he jumped clear of a 13-man breakaway group on the closing climb of the 188km stage to claim his seventh victory of 2025.</p>\n<p>Ayuso‚Äôs win counts as UAE‚Äôs 76th of the season and their third in as many days following triumphs in the stage 5 team time trial and on stage 6 by mountain classification leader Jay Vine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing,&#8221; Ayuso said later. &#8220;After the Giro, when I won my first Grand Tour stage, to win a stage here in La Vuelta, which, for me, is my favourite race. And the way, especially I won today is something I think I&#8217;ll remember always, and I&#8217;m just super proud.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s super nice already. The team time trial was very special because it&#8217;s a victory from everyone and in equal parts. And Jay did an amazing stage yesterday, winning in front of his wife and his child. So that was super special. And today, me.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a sprinter, so tomorrow, I think we won&#8217;t win, but we hope we can carry on like this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech) took second place, having earlier matched Ayuso‚Äôs first acceleration. He couldn‚Äôt stay with the next one, however, and ended his day best of the rest at 1:15 down. Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) rounded out the stage podium at 1:21 down, having raced with Frigo for much of the final climb.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, there was no real GC movement as all the big names crossed the line together, despite an earlier brief attempt by Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to go clear.</p>\n<p>In the end, the top favourites and red jersey Torstein Tr√¶en (Bahrain Victorious) finished together at 2:35 down, though Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) did nip off the front to take five seconds with a late attack.</p>\n<p>The general classification is shuffled somewhat following stage 7, with Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) moving to second overall at 2:33 down on Tr√¶en. Almeida is up to third place at 2:41 down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe seventh stage of the Vuelta a Espa√±a saw the peloton remain in the mountains for another tough day of climbing and four more classified climbs on the 188km from Andorra la Vella to Cerler.</p>\n<p>Along the way, the riders would face 4,200 ascent metres, including the first-category Port del Cant√≥ (24.7km at 4.4%), second-category Puerto de la Creu de Perves (5.7km at 6.3%) and Coll de L‚ÄôEspina (7.1km at 5.5%), and the first-category closer at Cerler (12.1km at 5.8%).</p>\n<p>Following his struggles and major time loss on Thursday‚Äôs stage 6, it was no surprise to see Ayuso among the early attackers on the stage as the ascent of Port del Cant√≥ began just 10km into the day.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard, now languishing 10 minutes off the race lead, took off early in the climb solo to establish what would eventually become the break of the day. His teammate, stage 6 winner Vine, was another early attacker, as was Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Ayuso crested the top of the mountain alone with a 12-man group ‚Äì including Vine and Pedersen ‚Äì following him. Things would come together down the descent, however.</p>\n<p>After 50km of racing, the breakaway of 13 was established at the front. Frigo, Garc√≠a Pierna, Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana), Damien Howson (Q36.5), Brieuc Rolland (Groupama-FDJ), Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Kevin Vermaerke (Picnic-PostNL), Eduardo Sep√∫lveda (Lotto) and the EF Education-EasyPost pairing of Sean Quinn and Jardi Van der Lee joined the aforementioned trio in the lead.</p>\n<p>The gap remained hovering around the minute mark in the valley road after the descent, with Bahrain Victorious working on the front for new race leader Tr√¶en. However, that would eventually grow as the riders hit the Creu de Perves, with the break‚Äôs advantage stretching to four minutes after mountain classification leader Vine won the sprint for five points over the top.</p>\n<p>Little changed down on the other side and on the road to the Coll de L‚ÄôEspina, with Bahrain continuing at the front, and the gap remaining at around the four-minute mark. At the top, Vine again jumped at the front to add another five points to his haul, while the break remained all together.</p>\n<p>At the intermediate sprint just before the final climb, green jersey Pedersen rolled off the front to collect the points before dropping back, while Nicolau also dropped from the break before the final ascent.</p>\n<p>As the break began the climb with 12km to go, they held 3:35 on the peloton, now led by Visma-Lease a Bike. It didn‚Äôt take long for the first attack from the breakaway, though, as Ayuso took off at the front, taking Frigo with him.</p>\n<p>The pair briefly rode at the front together, with Garc√≠a Pierna in pursuit, though at the 9.5km to go marker, Ayuso jumped again to lead solo. He swiftly put time between him and the rest, building a 50-second lead over the next 4km.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, three minutes down, Ayuso‚Äôs teammates Soler and Almeida took over at the front. As the Spaniard neared the 3km marker, Almeida made his move, taking Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) with him, as Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) battled to stay in touch.</p>\n<p>Kuss and Ciccone were next to go as the US rider went to the front to set the pace. However, the larger group of dropped riders ‚Äì including the red jersey Tr√¶en ‚Äì managed to get back in touch.</p>\n<p>Up front, Ayuso led by 1:15 heading into the final 2km, while Frigo left Garc√≠a Pierna behind in the chase. He was in trouble on the final run to the line, duly holding on to take yet another win for UAE Team Emirates-XRG.</p>\n<p>As Ayuso rolled across the line to savour his comeback victory, his teammate and compatriot Soler jumped from the GC group, going solo into the final kilometre to snatch back five seconds at the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine scored UAE Team Emirates-XRG‚Äôs second win in as many days at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, soloing to stage 6 glory from the breakaway after attacking over the day‚Äôs penultimate climb.</p>\n<p>Vine captured his team‚Äôs 75th victory of the season after proving the strongest from the 10-man break. The Australian went clear on the short but sharp La Comella climb with 21km to go of the 170km stage before pulling out a minute‚Äôs gap and holding on up the 9.6km climb to the finish in Pal Andorra.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old raced on solo for the win and with it the blue and white polka dot jersey as mountain classification leader, while behind him, another jersey changed hands.</p>\n<p>Torstein Tr√¶en (Bahrain Victorious), who started the stage 58 seconds off Jonas Vingegaard‚Äôs (Visma-Lease A Bike) red jersey, came home in second place at 54 seconds, propelling him into the race lead as the GC men finished over four minutes down.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was definitely to win the stage, but there was always the option that if the break wasn‚Äôt going to win, that I could come back and do some work,‚Äù Vine said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know these roads pretty well. I‚Äôm from just down the hill, and La Comella is my favourite climb in all of Andorra. I would‚Äôve normally liked to have done it way harder but with the headwind, it was hard to get the guys to pull through and make it really hard.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI decided to go at the top and with the wet descent, I know the descent really well and I thought ‚ÄòOK, this is my chance to get away and then there‚Äôs no funny business. It‚Äôs just mano y mano‚Äô.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Vuelta wasn‚Äôt on my schedule originally, so to be able to win in Andorra in front of my son and wife is unbelievable and incredibly motivating. That last 5km, all I could think of was ‚ÄòThis is for you Harrison, this is for you‚Äô.‚Äù</p>\n<p>While Vine soared to the third Vuelta stage win of his career, the day wasn‚Äôt all joy for his UAE team. Back down the mountain, GC co-leader Juan Ayuso surprisingly dropped from the GC group at 4km from the finish, eventually losing 11:51.</p>\n<p>The team will now look towards Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) as their sole GC hopeful, with the Portuguese rider having led the GC group home at 4:19. He was joined in the group by Vingegaard, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek), Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and many of the other big names, with the day providing no huge GC surprises ‚Äì barring Ayuso‚Äôs implosion.</p>\n<p>Tr√¶en now leads the Vuelta over fellow breakaway riders Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), the pair lying at 31 seconds and 1:01 down. Vingegaard is the best-placed GC favourite, lying 2:33 down in fifth overall.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 6 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a headed into the high mountains for the first time, tackling four major climbs and 3,600 metres of climbing on the road to Andorra.</p>\n<p>The 170km stage took the peloton from Olot to Pal with climbs along the way including the third category Coll de Sentigosa (11.4km at 4.1%), the first category Collada de Toses (24.3km at 3.5%), the second category La Comella (4.2km at 8%), and the first category closing ascent (9.6km at 6.3%) at 1,901 metres of altitude.</p>\n<p>The battle for the breakaway began right away with the Coll de Sentigosa coming right at the start of the stage. Attacks flew on the way up and it wasn‚Äôt long before a group of 10 ‚Äì the day‚Äôs breakaway ‚Äì went clear.</p>\n<p>Vine, Tr√¶en, Fortunato, and Armirail were among the notable names in the move. Joining them in the break were Pablo Castrillo (Movistar), Ramses Debruyne (Alpecin-Deceuninck), the EF Education-EasyPost duo James Shaw and Archie Ryan, and Soudal-QuickStep pair Louis Vervaeke and Gianmarco Garofoli.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, Visma-Lease A Bike took up the pacemaking on behalf of race leader Jonas Vingegaard, while the break raced four minutes up the road.</p>\n<p>Vervaeke was on a mission, lying just three points off mountain classification leader Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA). He grabbed two points over the top of the Sentigosa, moving one point down, while at the top of the long Collada de Toses, the Belgian lead the race to take 10 points and move into the virtual KOM lead.</p>\n<p>Racing through the rain and down into the valley on the other side, the break grew their advantage to five minutes with both Visma-Lease A Bike and UAE Team Emirates-XRG continuing to control behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was up to 5:30 at the lowest point in the valley with 55km to go, with the uphill run into Andorra and the two final climbs left to tackle.

Andorra : 170,3 km</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-34821\"></span><br />\nThe 2025 Vuelta a Espa√±a is a three-week cycling race taking place in Italy, France, Andorra and Spain. It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine scored UAE Team Emirates-XRG‚Äôs second win in as many days at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, soloing to stage 6 glory from the breakaway after attacking over the day‚Äôs penultimate climb.</p>\n<p>Vine captured his team‚Äôs 75th victory of the season after proving the strongest from the 10-man break. The Australian went clear on the short but sharp La Comella climb with 21km to go of the 170km stage before pulling out a minute‚Äôs gap and holding on up the 9.6km climb to the finish in Pal Andorra.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old raced on solo for the win and with it the blue and white polka dot jersey as mountain classification leader, while behind him, another jersey changed hands.</p>\n<p>Torstein Tr√¶en (Bahrain Victorious), who started the stage 58 seconds off Jonas Vingegaard‚Äôs (Visma-Lease A Bike) red jersey, came home in second place at 54 seconds, propelling him into the race lead as the GC men finished over four minutes down.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was definitely to win the stage, but there was always the option that if the break wasn‚Äôt going to win, that I could come back and do some work,‚Äù Vine said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know these roads pretty well. I‚Äôm from just down the hill, and La Comella is my favourite climb in all of Andorra. I would‚Äôve normally liked to have done it way harder but with the headwind, it was hard to get the guys to pull through and make it really hard.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI decided to go at the top and with the wet descent, I know the descent really well and I thought ‚ÄòOK, this is my chance to get away and then there‚Äôs no funny business. It‚Äôs just mano y mano‚Äô.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Vuelta wasn‚Äôt on my schedule originally, so to be able to win in Andorra in front of my son and wife is unbelievable and incredibly motivating. That last 5km, all I could think of was ‚ÄòThis is for you Harrison, this is for you‚Äô.‚Äù</p>\n<p>While Vine soared to the third Vuelta stage win of his career, the day wasn‚Äôt all joy for his UAE team. Back down the mountain, GC co-leader Juan Ayuso surprisingly dropped from the GC group at 4km from the finish, eventually losing 11:51.</p>\n<p>The team will now look towards Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) as their sole GC hopeful, with the Portuguese rider having led the GC group home at 4:19. He was joined in the group by Vingegaard, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek), Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and many of the other big names, with the day providing no huge GC surprises ‚Äì barring Ayuso‚Äôs implosion.</p>\n<p>Tr√¶en now leads the Vuelta over fellow breakaway riders Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), the pair lying at 31 seconds and 1:01 down. Vingegaard is the best-placed GC favourite, lying 2:33 down in fifth overall.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 6 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a headed into the high mountains for the first time, tackling four major climbs and 3,600 metres of climbing on the road to Andorra.</p>\n<p>The 170km stage took the peloton from Olot to Pal with climbs along the way including the third category Coll de Sentigosa (11.4km at 4.1%), the first category Collada de Toses (24.3km at 3.5%), the second category La Comella (4.2km at 8%), and the first category closing ascent (9.6km at 6.3%) at 1,901 metres of altitude.</p>\n<p>The battle for the breakaway began right away with the Coll de Sentigosa coming right at the start of the stage. Attacks flew on the way up and it wasn‚Äôt long before a group of 10 ‚Äì the day‚Äôs breakaway ‚Äì went clear.</p>\n<p>Vine, Tr√¶en, Fortunato, and Armirail were among the notable names in the move. Joining them in the break were Pablo Castrillo (Movistar), Ramses Debruyne (Alpecin-Deceuninck), the EF Education-EasyPost duo James Shaw and Archie Ryan, and Soudal-QuickStep pair Louis Vervaeke and Gianmarco Garofoli.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, Visma-Lease A Bike took up the pacemaking on behalf of race leader Jonas Vingegaard, while the break raced four minutes up the road.</p>\n<p>Vervaeke was on a mission, lying just three points off mountain classification leader Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA). He grabbed two points over the top of the Sentigosa, moving one point down, while at the top of the long Collada de Toses, the Belgian lead the race to take 10 points and move into the virtual KOM lead.</p>\n<p>Racing through the rain and down into the valley on the other side, the break grew their advantage to five minutes with both Visma-Lease A Bike and UAE Team Emirates-XRG continuing to control behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was up to 5:30 at the lowest point in the valley with 55km to go, with the uphill run into Andorra and the two final climbs left to tackle. With no massive impetus from behind to speed up the pace, that only crept up over six minutes during the next 15km.</p>\n<p>The pace behind went up as the day‚Äôs penultimate climb, La Comella, neared, however. At the base of the mountain with 25km to go, the 10 men of the break held an ever-reducing gap of 5:20.</p>\n<p>Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) made a short-lived move out of the peloton on the 4.2km climb, though the big favourites preferred to stay put as Visma-Lease A Bike continued to control.</p>\n<p>Up front, Armirail struggled to stay in touch as Vine led over the top ahead of Vervaeke, while back in the peloton, Almeida battled back from an untimely bike change.</p>\n<p>Vine pushed on alone at the front, pulling out a 50-second gap as he raced through his adopted home of Andorra and into the final 10km.

It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG added to their already huge tally of victories for the 2025 season, taking out the stage 5 team time trial of the Vuelta a Espa√±a in Figueres for win number 74 of the season, posting a time of 25:26 over 24.1 kilometres.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard moved back into the red leader&#8217;s jersey after his Visma-Lease a Bike team finished second on the stage, eight seconds behind UAE.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lidl-Trek, who held the quickest time for most of the day, faded to third, nine seconds down on the stage winners.</p>\n<p>With the stage win by his team, Juan Ayuso climbed into second place overall, tied on the same time with teammate Jo√£o Almeida, eight seconds down on Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew we would be fighting for the win, but there‚Äôs a lot of good teams here and we need to be realistic,&#8221; Almeida said. &#8220;I think we did a really perfect job and we deserve it as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s good to give us confidence as well. But, of course, the gaps are small. It doesn&#8217;t really mean anything, but it&#8217;s a good start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>David Gaudu&#8217;s Groupama-FDJ squad narrowly avoided two stopped police motorbikes while hurtling toward the finish, and the 24-second deficit meant the Frenchman lost his hold on the race lead.</p>\n<p>Gaudu dropped to sixth in the GC standings, 16 seconds behind Vingegaard.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe team time trial provided another chance for the overall Vuelta a Espa√±a contenders to gain time, with a 24.1-kilometre, almost completely flat test.</p>\n<p>Lotto was the first team down the ramp and set a surprisingly good time, holding off Intermach√©-Wanty, Alpecin-Deceuninck, Picnic-PostNL and Cofidis.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek were on track to take the fastest time, going 13 seconds faster at the second check. However, a mistake from Carlos Verona in a turn saw him drop off prematurely. Julien Bernard followed shortly after, leaving six men to complete the final 8.7km.</p>\n<p>Even with the hiccups, Lidl-Trek moved into the hot seat with a time 18 seconds quicker than Lotto&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>Speaking of hiccups, Israel-Premier Tech were interrupted by a group protesting Israel&#8217;s war on Gaza, with several of the riders forced to hit the brakes. That meant the team came through the first check with the slowest time. They made up some ground by the finish, but were fourth from last at the line.</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers were next to set the fastest time at the intermediate checks, going almost 10 seconds faster at the first timing after 7.8km. However, they faded over the second half and came through the line seven seconds slower than Lidl-Trek.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe were second-fastest at the first check but suffered a crash, with Matteo Sobrero going down hard. They finished just over three seconds behind Lidl-Trek.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates came through the first check ahead of Visma-Lease a Bike and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, but by the second check, they had faded to third best, four seconds down.</p>\n<p>Heading into the finish, Marc Soler was fighting to hold onto the wheels as the fourth man, UAE Team Emirates-XRG did enough to unseat Lidl-Trek by nine seconds.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike lost a lot of ground by the second check, coming through 17 seconds slower than Lidl-Trek. However, the team really picked up the pace in the final section and came to the line with five riders only eight seconds down on UAE.</p>\n<p>Because Vingegaard had a 16-second advantage over Juan Ayuso and Jo√£o Almeida at the start of the day, he was in the virtual lead with only Groupama-FDJ left to finish.</p>\n<p>The French team were 10 seconds behind Visma at the second check but faded in the finale and Gaudu dropped out of the race lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Great Britain&#8217;s Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) shocked all the big sprinters to take victory on stage 4 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a, winning his maiden Grand Tour stage in Voiron with an impressive sprint.</p>\n<p>Expected to be a bunch sprint, the uphill drag to the line in France made the sprint harder than expected, and it was a never-fading Turner who came past Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to take victory.</p>\n<p>Philipsen had to settle for second, despite a strong lead-out from his team, with his teammate Edward Planckaert finishing third after delivering the Belgian right to the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to be honest,&#8221; said an emotional Turner at the finish, who was only sent to the Vuelta at the last minute.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy week, super crazy. I wanted to come to the Vuelta, and I still had some issues with my leg since the Giro, but the team believed in me and I went to Renewi [Tour], and then they said they needed me, so of course you say &#8216;yeah&#8217;. I&#8217;d do anything to race these races.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a crazy feeling. I was devastated in the first sprint when my chain came off, but I really believed in myself today. I felt really good all day. I don&#8217;t know what to say, just thank you the boys, it&#8217;s such a good atmosphere at this race, it&#8217;s just been amazing. Also what all the boys did today, and Kwiato [Michal Kwiatkowski], it&#8217;s just unbelievable, in Poland and here, for sure all the results I&#8217;ve had the last weeks wouldn&#8217;t be without him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A late attack came from Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), who countered after the final intermediate sprint, but he was duly reeled back in by the sprint teams with 15km to go as they ensured there was a bunch finish in Voiron ‚Äì though the winner wasn&#8217;t the sprinter anyone expected.</p>\n<p>After winning stage 3 and moving onto equal time with the race leader, David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) finished 25th on the stage, sufficiently far ahead of red jersey Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) to move into the race lead, and now sits top of GC on countback.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nHeading uphill straight from the start in Susa, it didn&#8217;t take long for a breakaway to form in the opening throes of stage 4, with a five-man group forming in 15km of racing. This group was comprised of Louis Vervaeke (Soudal-QuickStep), Sean Quinn (EF Education-EasyPost), Kamiel Bonneu (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Mario Aparicio (Burgos Burpellet BH), and they soon built a gap of three minutes.</p>\n<p>With three categorised climbs packed into the first half but a flat finish, it was important for the sprint teams to not let the leaders&#8217; gain too much of an advantage on the ascents, as they needed to keep the gap closable, which saw Lidl-Trek working fairly steadily in the first 50km of racing, not letting the gap go much over three minutes.</p>\n<p>Though it was only stage 4, the hard start left no room for weakness, and some riders pulled out in the early part of the stage, including 10th place at the start of the day, Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>Over the final major climb of the first part of the race, the Col du Lauteret, the gap started to shrink, and the five leaders went over it ahead, but the peloton were closing in on the long descent, and with 95km the break was caught. Though their efforts didn&#8217;t go close to the finish, Nicolau&#8217;s exploits over the categorised climbs did see him move into the KOM jersey.</p>\n<p>Soon after the catch, a second Burgos Burpellet BH rider went on the attack, with Sinuh√© Fern√°ndez following on from Aparicio&#8217;s stint in the break.

It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Great Britain&#8217;s Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) shocked all the big sprinters to take victory on stage 4 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a, winning his maiden Grand Tour stage in Voiron with an impressive sprint.</p>\n<p>Expected to be a bunch sprint, the uphill drag to the line in France made the sprint harder than expected, and it was a never-fading Turner who came past Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to take victory.</p>\n<p>Philipsen had to settle for second, despite a strong lead-out from his team, with his teammate Edward Planckaert finishing third after delivering the Belgian right to the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to be honest,&#8221; said an emotional Turner at the finish, who was only sent to the Vuelta at the last minute.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy week, super crazy. I wanted to come to the Vuelta, and I still had some issues with my leg since the Giro, but the team believed in me and I went to Renewi [Tour], and then they said they needed me, so of course you say &#8216;yeah&#8217;. I&#8217;d do anything to race these races.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a crazy feeling. I was devastated in the first sprint when my chain came off, but I really believed in myself today. I felt really good all day. I don&#8217;t know what to say, just thank you the boys, it&#8217;s such a good atmosphere at this race, it&#8217;s just been amazing. Also what all the boys did today, and Kwiato [Michal Kwiatkowski], it&#8217;s just unbelievable, in Poland and here, for sure all the results I&#8217;ve had the last weeks wouldn&#8217;t be without him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A late attack came from Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), who countered after the final intermediate sprint, but he was duly reeled back in by the sprint teams with 15km to go as they ensured there was a bunch finish in Voiron ‚Äì though the winner wasn&#8217;t the sprinter anyone expected.</p>\n<p>After winning stage 3 and moving onto equal time with the race leader, David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) finished 25th on the stage, sufficiently far ahead of red jersey Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) to move into the race lead, and now sits top of GC on countback.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nHeading uphill straight from the start in Susa, it didn&#8217;t take long for a breakaway to form in the opening throes of stage 4, with a five-man group forming in 15km of racing. This group was comprised of Louis Vervaeke (Soudal-QuickStep), Sean Quinn (EF Education-EasyPost), Kamiel Bonneu (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Mario Aparicio (Burgos Burpellet BH), and they soon built a gap of three minutes.</p>\n<p>With three categorised climbs packed into the first half but a flat finish, it was important for the sprint teams to not let the leaders&#8217; gain too much of an advantage on the ascents, as they needed to keep the gap closable, which saw Lidl-Trek working fairly steadily in the first 50km of racing, not letting the gap go much over three minutes.</p>\n<p>Though it was only stage 4, the hard start left no room for weakness, and some riders pulled out in the early part of the stage, including 10th place at the start of the day, Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>Over the final major climb of the first part of the race, the Col du Lauteret, the gap started to shrink, and the five leaders went over it ahead, but the peloton were closing in on the long descent, and with 95km the break was caught. Though their efforts didn&#8217;t go close to the finish, Nicolau&#8217;s exploits over the categorised climbs did see him move into the KOM jersey.</p>\n<p>Soon after the catch, a second Burgos Burpellet BH rider went on the attack, with Sinuh√© Fern√°ndez following on from Aparicio&#8217;s stint in the break. Despite getting away on the flat, the Spaniard did manage to pull out a gap, which was up to 50 seconds with 60km to go to the finish. Alpecin and Lidl-Trek worked to keep the gap under control and ensure the sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Over a small uncategorised climb with 47km to go, Fern√°ndez was caught, and things began to win up for the intermediate sprint and the finale. At the intermediate with 32km to go, red jersey hopeful Gaudu tried to get up there to grab some bonus seconds, but didn&#8217;t quite manage it, finishing outside of the placings as Mads Pedersen took the maximum points.</p>\n<p>The sprint opened up a counter-attack from Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), and the French time trialist built up a gap, leading by 40 seconds with 20km to go, really forcing the sprint teams to work hard.

Pedersen enjoyed a perfect lead-out from Giulio Ciccone in the final few hundred metres, only to be pipped to the line by Gaudu, with red jersey Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) in third place, continuing his lead overall.</p>\n<p>Pedersen came into the stage as the overwhelming favourite, but ran out of legs in the end as Gaudu recorded his first stage win in a Grand Tour in five years.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman had shown a glimpse of his form the previous day by finishing third in the first uphill finish of the race, but the shock was visible on his face after crossing the finish line. With his victory, Gaudu draws level on time with Vingegaard, moving up to second on the general classification, with Ciccone now third.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was thinking in the bus this morning it was more for Pedersen, but [Stefan] K√ºng said to me this morning I have a punch and I can win today,‚Äù a delighted Gaudu said in the TV interview after the finish.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe team is doing a very, very, very good job. They keep us on the first position all day. So I&#8217;m very happy. I&#8217;m very, very proud to win for me, for the team.

Lidl-Trek began with intention, putting their two rouleurs, Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier and Daan Hoole, straight to the front to control a breakaway of four which moved away in the early stages.</p>\n<p>The break was made up of: Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Sean Quinn (EF Education-EasyPost), Patrick Gamper (Jayco-AlUla) and Lars Van Boven (Intermarch√©-Wanty). The quartet‚Äôs lead grew to around 2:30 at its peak.</p>\n<p>With 75km to go, the riders began climbing the main test of the day, the second category Issiglio climb (5.8km @ 6.5%). For the first time, multiple teams came to the front, hoping to put their leaders in the best position. The break split on the climb with Quinn and Verre too strong for their companions. The Italian was looking to make the KOM jersey that he was wearing on behalf of Vingegaard his own. He did just that, taking five points for crossing the line in first place.</p>\n<p>Behind, Ghebreigzabhier was driving things on for Lidl-Trek, aiming to make the race as hard as possible to put the fastest sprinters in trouble, with several riders being dropped off the back.</p>\n<p>As the riders completed the descent, Quinn rolled through the intermediate sprint in Cuorgn√© in first place as the pair held a lead of two minutes with 55 up-and-down kilometres left to ride. Quinn struck clear 15km later, but the gap back to the peloton was now less than a minute as the road dragged up an unclassified ascent.</p>\n<p>Quinn was caught with 19km to go as the road began its long drag towards the finish in Ceres, with more teams now taking an interest in being near the front of the peloton. The pace was ramping up as teams fought for position through several technical sections, some protecting GC riders, others hoping for a shot at the stage. With 8km left, Lidl-Trek‚Äôs first objective was ticked off with Philipsen dropping off the back.</p>\n<p>Five or more teams fanned across the road in the last 5km, which only averaged 3%, but looked much harder than that with the racing at full tilt for the entire stage. Visma-Lease a Bike took over in the finale‚Äôs steepest section &#8211; up to 7% &#8211; with Vingegaard well positioned alongside Pedersen and Filippo Ganna, who had been moved up late by Ineos Grenadiers.</p>\n<p>As Ciccone took over in the final 500 metres, the group behind him splintered and split under the pace.

It started on 23 August in Turin, and will finish on 14 September in Madrid. Twenty-three teams are participating in the race.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) denied Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) the victory on home soil, coming from behind to win by millimetres atop the Limone Piemonte climb. David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) was third.</p>\n<p>The Dane crashed in a rain-slicked roundabout along with most of his teammates on the run-in to the final climb, but emerged relatively unscathed to snatch the overall leader&#8217;s jersey as stage 1 winner Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) lost contact on the climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since my last victory, I&#8217;m super happy with how I felt and how the team did today &#8211; also super happy to have the red jersey,&#8221; Vingegaard said.</p>\n<p>Ciccone opened up the sprint from the reduced peloton atop the gentle slopes of the 10-kilometre ascent and looked sure to win the stage but could not hold off the charge from Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, before the corner, I didn&#8217;t think that it would be possible to pass him,&#8221; Vingegaard said. &#8220;But then from the corner on, it was a bit longer to the finish than I thought. Luckily I could just pass him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vingegaard had a scare as the rain fell and the roads turned slippery in the final 25km when a rider crashed on the exit of a roundabout and took him down, but he confirmed that he was OK.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went down pretty hard, but it seems like I didn&#8217;t hurt myself too bad. I have a bit of bruises, but I think because it was so slippery, I was sliding more so I didn&#8217;t really get any bad road rash or anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vingegaard leads the overall standings by four seconds over Ciccone with Gaudu third at six seconds. Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) is fourth at 10 seconds just ahead of Tom Pidcock (Q36.5).</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first part of the day over the flatlands of southern Piedmont unfolded calmly enough, barring a crash in the neutralised zone for local favourite Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) ,and with a five-rider break of non-GC threats quickly forming.</p>\n<p>Rather than being made up of purely non-WorldTour teams as so often happens in the first weeks of the Vuelta, interestingly, Nico Denz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Liam Slock (Lotto), and Gal Glivar from race leader Jasper Philipsen&#8217;s Alpecin-Deceuninck squad were all present, along with Jakub Otruba (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), while Sinhuh√© Fern√°ndez (Burgos-Burpellet BH) jumped across late on.</p>\n<p>After a brief spell on the front, Denz opted to sit up, but the remaining quartet continued to collaborate well, with Q36.5, clearly working for Pidcock, putting in much of the spadework to ensure their advantage stayed at around two minutes. Slock managed to clinch maximum points in the intermediate sprint in the town of Busca (Km 67) ahead of Otruba, while Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) made inroads on Jasper Philipsen&#8217;s lead by clinching fifth.</p>\n<p>As the stage moved into its second, more critical half, the arrival of light rain did little to deter an uptick in the overall pace. With 60 kilometres to go, the margin still stood at just over 90 seconds, and as the race finally moved into hillier terrain in the last 50 kilometres, the gap had barely dropped.</p>\n<p>However, a small, unclassified climb saw the break begin to crumble under its own weight, as the four leading riders started attacking each other on the increasingly wet roads. Fern√°ndez was the first to fall behind, leaving just a trio of Otruba, Slock, and Glivar ahead, while Q36 continued to lay down the pace as the rain grew steadily heavier.</p>\n<p>The roads were steadily, almost imperceptibly, rising, with Ineos throwing their weight into the chase as well. The worsening weather conditions also contributed to a sharp increase in crashes. GC outsider and former Vuelta mountains champion Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ) fell on a descent and had to abandon.</p>\n<p>Then, with 30 kilometres to go, George Bennett (Israel-Premier Tech) could be seen doubled up in pain on the side of the road, although he was able to continue.</p>\n<p>The biggest pileup, though, was a mass fall on the right with around 30 kilometres to go. Multiple riders down, amongst them no less than four Visma riders including lead overall contender Vingegaard, spin off the road to the right of a roundabout, when a Movistar rider, Jorge Arcos, skidded on the rain-soaked exit. While most of the team could continue fairly quickly and Vingegaard needed a bike change, his teammate Axel Zingle ended up spending long minutes being checked over by the race doctors before he could keep riding.</p>\n<p>The peloton notably eased back to allow the fallers, which also included one top stage favourite, Pidcock. But Vingegaard&#8217;s raising of his left thumb as the TV cameras focused in on him and teammate Campenaerts, bringing him back to the bunch, indicated he was, in fact, ok, barring a bloody elbow.</p>\n<p>By the time Vingegaard regained contact after a five-kilometre pursuit, the leading trio&#8217;s gap had risen again to 1:45. However, the notable rise in pace that then followed, helped by the roads drying out, too, saw the pendulum swing back against them, and with 12 kilometres left, that advantage had halved. Although the three made it onto the foot of the Limone still ahead, the combined might of Ineos, UAE and Visma was likely going to prove too much for them to survive for too long on the ascent itself.</p>\n<p>Vuelta leader Philipsen had, unsurprisingly, already sat up before the ascent with all the other sprinters, while ahead Slock gave it one last crack of the whip and powered ahead alone. The slowly rising percentages on the climb did not deter the peloton from maintaining a ferocious pace, however, and after sweeping up Otruba and Gliver as they roared into the town of Limone Piemonte, by the time they came out of it, Slock was also forced to throw in the towel.</p>\n<p>Visma&#8217;s hard work for Vingegaard in the middle of the broad &#8216;A&#8217;-road was matched by Bob Jungels for Ineos and Jayco-AlUlA on the left but there were still easily 100 riders in the front group with five kilometres to go. The hyper-fast ascent then saw Visma come to the fore alone with Wilco Kelderman, Vingegaard remaining firmly in third position in the head of the pack. 2.5 kilometres from the top, though, there was a change of scenario as Visma started to run out of support riders, with Lidl-Trek beginning to set the pace on an abruptly much tougher, narrower, finale. No attacks materialized as the race roared under the one-kilometre-to-go banner.</p>\n<p>Finally, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) burst out of the pack, only for Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) to counter. That challenge was quickly matched by Ciccone, making a prolonged acceleration as the road swung to the right and the finishing gantry. However, his late charge was countered by an equally dramatic charge for the line by Vingegaard, closing in on the Italian to clinch his first-ever Vuelta a Espa√±a lead and third Vuelta stage of his career by less than half a wheel.</p>\n<p>Such an early knock-out blow will doubtless both enormously boost Vingegaard&#8217;s morale, and it also shows that rather than risk any first week ambushes or changes of narrative &#8211; as so often happens in the Vuelta &#8211; the Dane is determined to establish his authority on the race from the word go.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Meanwhile, Reinderink was the first to cross the line at the intermediate sprint in Valdengo ahead of Vinokurov and Bouwman, giving them six, four and two bonus seconds respectively.</p>\n<p>The peloton then gradually began to reel in the breakaway and had them within sight, before De la Calle made a move off the front of the group and went solo in an attempt to win the combativity award. A few of the other riders made a half-hearted attempt to go with him, but they were soon caught by the bunch behind.</p>\n<p>With De la Calle now the sole leader at the head of the race, the peloton allowed him to extend his advantage once again, but always kept him well within reach and eventually made the catch with just under 40km to go.</p>\n<p>Many teams then began to come to the fore, as they looked to position themselves at the front of the bunch ahead of a technical finale which featured plenty of road furniture.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek were washed away in one of the many roundabouts in the final kilometre, while Alpecin-Deceuninck left every other sprinter in their wake with a textbook leadout to deliver Philipsen to the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

This was a nice goal, but I knew we only had one chance because there aren&#8217;t many opportunities for a sprinter like me at this Vuelta.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting with the Gran Salida in Turin, the opening stage of this year‚Äôs Vuelta a Espa√±a took the race along a 186.1km-long route across the Piedmont region in the northwest of Italy for a sprint finish in the Roman city of Novara.</p>\n<p>The day began with a group of six riders establishing itself at the head of the race, as Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal Quick-Step), Nicolas Vinokurov (XDS Astana), Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Koen Bouwman (Jayco AlUla) and Hugo de la Calle (Burgos Burpellet BH) got themselves up the road.</p>\n<p>Their advantage was kept well within check by the peloton, with Lidl-Trek and Alpecin-Deceuninck controlling the gap for most of the day, as they looked to ensure a sprint finish for respective sprinters.</p>\n<p>The sole categorised climb of the day came around 63km into the stage, with Verre taking the maximum points to secure the polka dot jersey for tomorrow‚Äôs stage. Meanwhile, Reinderink was the first to cross the line at the intermediate sprint in Valdengo ahead of Vinokurov and Bouwman, giving them six, four and two bonus seconds respectively.</p>\n<p>The peloton then gradually began to reel in the breakaway and had them within sight, before De la Calle made a move off the front of the group and went solo in an attempt to win the combativity award. A few of the other riders made a half-hearted attempt to go with him, but they were soon caught by the bunch behind.</p>\n<p>With De la Calle now the sole leader at the head of the race, the peloton allowed him to extend his advantage once again, but always kept him well within reach and eventually made the catch with just under 40km to go.</p>\n<p>Many teams then began to come to the fore, as they looked to position themselves at the front of the bunch ahead of a technical finale which featured plenty of road furniture.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek were washed away in one of the many roundabouts in the final kilometre, while Alpecin-Deceuninck left every other sprinter in their wake with a textbook leadout to deliver Philipsen to the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2017, the online discount broker BinckBank took over as the title sponsor, with the name of the race changing accordingly. In 2021, with the absence of a title sponsor, the race was known again as the Benelux Tour. The race was not held in 2022 due to conflicts with the racing calendar.

Once on the twisting uphill cobbles at the base of the Vesten, De Lie moved out of the saddle to lead the charge in the breakaway group, with Wellens distanced immediately with the force of the acceleration.</p>\n<p>Former World Champion Van der Poel matched De Lie&#8217;s effort and made a smooth pass on the final corner to take the victory on the Vesten, which leads up to the iconic Muur van Geraardsbergen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you have a finish on this kind of road here, you know it&#8217;s gonna hurt.

They cooperated to hold off a chase behind from the GC leaders and played out the sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>W√¶renskjold got stuck on the front in the final kilometre, flicking his elbow for someone to come through with no response. Sheehan launched first, knowing he would have to go early and surprise if he was to win from elite company.</p>\n<p>Narv√°ez played things perfectly, in typical fashion, kicking off his sprint into Sheehan&#8217;s wheel and coming out of the American&#8217;s slipstream to beat him on the line in Arnsberg. Marius Mayfhofer (Tudor Pro Cycling) chased alone in no-man&#8217;s-land to finish fourth, with Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) leading the bunch home 14 seconds after the leaders.</p>\n<p>Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) also finished in the Milan group, but ceded the overall lead to W√¶renskjold, thanks to the bonus seconds gained on the line and the gap to the chasers. Narv√°ez moved to second overall, one second back, with Sheehan well within touching distance at a four-second disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy final, but we gained the right momentum in the end. It was a nice race,&#8221; said Narv√°z, who had been on the attack earlier in the stage to try and make the day difficult from a break, with UAE starting in Germany without a sprinter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I recovered well after the Tour de France training at home, being quiet with my family, and then I came straight here ‚Äì it&#8217;s always nice to win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t overly bullish about now winning the GC, simply stating: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how the situation is now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A five-man breakaway got up the road to kick off stage 2 of the Deutschland Tour from Herford, with 190km separating them from the finish in Arnsberg. It was made up of Vincent Bodet (Picnic-PostNL), Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Vinzent Dorn (BIKE AID), Miguel Heidemann (REMBE-rad-net) and Emƒ´ls Liepi≈Ü≈° (Q36.5 Pro Cycling).</p>\n<p>They would last for the majority of the stage, with Rutsch the last to be caught with 18km to go and into the punchy finishing circuit in and around Arnsberg. After taking the bell, Visma-Lease a Bike continued to lead the peloton, having done much of the controlling.</p>\n<p>After this, the last phase of racing that followed was an all-out brawl to the line, with several attacks and a breathless chase by the top sprinters in an attempt not to miss out.</p>\n<p>It all kicked off on stage 2 after the bonus seconds sprint 15km from the line, where Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) outsprinted Edoardo Zambanini (Bahrain-Victorious) and Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) to the maximum prize.</p>\n<p>There was an unfortunate crash in the final phase of racing for German national champion Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch√©-Wanty), which also saw Tour de France podium finisher Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) crash hard off the side of the road, but both were thankfully able to finish.</p>\n<p>The attacks came thick and fast in the last 10km off the back of the bonus seconds sprint, with Ivan Rom√©o (Movistar), Narv√°ez and Sheehan all trying at points to get away. The best pure sprinters were still in contact after Milan and Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) worked to make it into the lead group.</p>\n<p>But the decisive blow came from W√¶renskjold inside the last 8km, with his move on an uphill section drawing out the Ecuadorian Champion and young US rider. It dropped most of the lead group after a furious end to the stage, and they would go on to play out the final sprint, with Narv√°ez taking a narrow victory ‚Äì UAE&#8217;s 73 of 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

They cooperated to hold off a chase behind from the GC leaders and played out the sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>W√¶renskjold got stuck on the front in the final kilometre, flicking his elbow for someone to come through with no response. Sheehan launched first, knowing he would have to go early and surprise if he was to win from elite company.</p>\n<p>Narv√°ez played things perfectly, in typical fashion, kicking off his sprint into Sheehan&#8217;s wheel and coming out of the American&#8217;s slipstream to beat him on the line in Arnsberg. Marius Mayfhofer (Tudor Pro Cycling) chased alone in no-man&#8217;s-land to finish fourth, with Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) leading the bunch home 14 seconds after the leaders.</p>\n<p>Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) also finished in the Milan group, but ceded the overall lead to W√¶renskjold, thanks to the bonus seconds gained on the line and the gap to the chasers. Narv√°ez moved to second overall, one second back, with Sheehan well within touching distance at a four-second disadvantage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a crazy final, but we gained the right momentum in the end. It was a nice race,&#8221; said Narv√°z, who had been on the attack earlier in the stage to try and make the day difficult from a break, with UAE starting in Germany without a sprinter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I recovered well after the Tour de France training at home, being quiet with my family, and then I came straight here ‚Äì it&#8217;s always nice to win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He wasn&#8217;t overly bullish about now winning the GC, simply stating: &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how the situation is now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A five-man breakaway got up the road to kick off stage 2 of the Deutschland Tour from Herford, with 190km separating them from the finish in Arnsberg. It was made up of Vincent Bodet (Picnic-PostNL), Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Vinzent Dorn (BIKE AID), Miguel Heidemann (REMBE-rad-net) and Emƒ´ls Liepi≈Ü≈° (Q36.5 Pro Cycling).</p>\n<p>They would last for the majority of the stage, with Rutsch the last to be caught with 18km to go and into the punchy finishing circuit in and around Arnsberg. After taking the bell, Visma-Lease a Bike continued to lead the peloton, having done much of the controlling.</p>\n<p>After this, the last phase of racing that followed was an all-out brawl to the line, with several attacks and a breathless chase by the top sprinters in an attempt not to miss out.</p>\n<p>It all kicked off on stage 2 after the bonus seconds sprint 15km from the line, where Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) outsprinted Edoardo Zambanini (Bahrain-Victorious) and Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) to the maximum prize.</p>\n<p>There was an unfortunate crash in the final phase of racing for German national champion Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch√©-Wanty), which also saw Tour de France podium finisher Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) crash hard off the side of the road, but both were thankfully able to finish.</p>\n<p>The attacks came thick and fast in the last 10km off the back of the bonus seconds sprint, with Ivan Rom√©o (Movistar), Narv√°ez and Sheehan all trying at points to get away. The best pure sprinters were still in contact after Milan and Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) worked to make it into the lead group.</p>\n<p>But the decisive blow came from W√¶renskjold inside the last 8km, with his move on an uphill section drawing out the Ecuadorian Champion and young US rider. It dropped most of the lead group after a furious end to the stage, and they would go on to play out the final sprint, with Narv√°ez taking a narrow victory ‚Äì UAE&#8217;s 73 of 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2017, the online discount broker BinckBank took over as the title sponsor, with the name of the race changing accordingly. In 2021, with the absence of a title sponsor, the race was known again as the Benelux Tour. The race was not held in 2022 due to conflicts with the racing calendar. In 2023, waste management company Renewi joined as a sponsor and renamed the race once again, this time to the Renewi Tour.</p>\n<p>Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) came from nowhere to win a messy sprint on stage 2 of the Renewi Tour, beating Pavel Bittner (Picnic PostNL) to the line in Ardooie after a breathless day of echelon racing.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike led for much of the final 5km and looked to have the perfect lead-out set up, but Kooij dropped back for the final 2km, perhaps knowing it was too early with only Christophe Laporte left to guide him.</p>\n<p>Jayco AlUla and Alpecin-Deceuninck found themselves towards the front under the flamme rouge as a couple of rogue solo attacks were closed down, but even a lead-out from Mathieu van der Poel couldn&#8217;t catapult Jensen Plowright to victory after hitting the front first.</p>\n<p>Kooij was waiting patiently in the bunch on the wheel of stage 1 winner Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep), but was forced to find a new lane when he was squeezed off of it.

I was a bit excited for this race and a little bit nervous. I tried to go full-gas and it worked out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>W√¶renskjold now leads the overall classification by one second ahead of Watson and two seconds ahead of Haller as the race heads into stage 1 from Essen to Herford on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one or two harder stages and sprint stages, so hopefully we can do well in the general classification. We came here with a good sprint team and with some boys, so hopefully we can hang on in the harder climbs also,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The opening stage of the Pro Series Deutschland Tour saw a high-quality field that included Visma-Lease a Bike&#8217;s Wout van Aert, who will work for Matthew Brennan, along with rival sprinters Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek), Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility), and Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p>While four stages are flat and two are hilly, the race could go to either a puncheur or a sprinter after five days of racing.</p>\n<p>W√¶renskjold said that a good warm-up was the key to his success in the flat 3.1km time trial, and that he was able to gradually increase his power as he raced back into Essen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I tried to at least have the rollers during the bike check. I was on a spare bike on the rollers next to the start line. I got out a little bit better with more blood flow in my legs, compared to sitting down for eight to ten minutes before a time trial. I think that was the key, to do well, today,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also tried to go all-out and through the corners, try to go hard from the start, but also progressively increasing power through the race. I tried to hit that maximum feeling of lactic acid in the legs at the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ilan van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep) set an early benchmark of 3:38, but that would only be good enough to reach the top 20 by the end of this time trial.</p>\n<p>Maikel Zijlaard (Tudor Pro cycling) posted a time of 3:34, which stood its ground for much longer, but he finished in seventh place.</p>\n<p>Haller was the next to arrive at the hot seat with a time of 3:33, and good enough for a podium spot. Out-pacing Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), who finished fifth, and Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) in fourth.</p>\n<p>W√¶renskjold raced in with the new fastest time of 3:31, with an average speed of 52.6kph, and the rider to come closest to that benchmark was runner-up Watson with a time of 3:32.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=00&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=36&#038;y=2025&#038;s=00&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2017, the online discount broker BinckBank took over as the title sponsor, with the name of the race changing accordingly. In 2021, with the absence of a title sponsor, the race was known again as the Benelux Tour. The race was not held in 2022 due to conflicts with the racing calendar. In 2023, waste management company Renewi joined as a sponsor and renamed the race once again, this time to the Renewi Tour.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-Quickstep) made it look easy to win the opening stage of the Renewi Tour in Breskens, powering past Pavel Bittner (Picnic-PostNL) in the sprint to snag the race&#8217;s first leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) and Sebastian Molano (UAE Team Emirates XRG) also sprinted past the fading Bittner to finish second and third on the stage, respectively.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All day I had a quite good feeling, so I was really confident to have it,&#8221; Merlier said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t assured we were going to have a sprint because of the strong breakaway. But in the end, it all came together, and the team did a really good job to bring me in a good position and I could launch my sprint in the right moment like I wanted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier&#8217;s team had an easier day with GC rider Paul Magnier in the day&#8217;s second breakaway, which forced other teams like Intermarch√©-Wanty to control the escape.</p>\n<p>The Renewi Tour is unique in that there are nine bonus seconds in three sprints inside what is called the &#8216;green kilometre&#8217;.</p>\n<p>While Merlier leads the overall classification with a ten-second time bonus for the victory, Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates) sits in second in the overall classification, two seconds behind Merlier after taking two of the sprints.</p>\n<p>Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), who gained seven seconds in time bonuses, is third, while De Lie is fourth at four seconds and Molano fifth at six seconds.</p>\n<p>The opening stage of the 2025 Renewi Tour, a flat 182.6km stage from Terneuzen to Breskens, seemed to go according to the usual early breakaway/sprint finish script, with seven riders attacking from the gun and getting a gap.</p>\n<p>The group included Robert Stannard (Bahrain Victorious), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost), Jelte Krijnsen (Jayco-AlUla), Siebe Deweirdt and Milan Lanhove (Flanders Baloise), Alexandre Van Petegem (Wagner Bazin WB), and Andreas Stokbro (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>Over the first 50km, the breakaway built up a lead of nearly two minutes, but in the middle of the stage, their advantage dropped precipitously as the peloton began to shatter in the crosswinds as the race entered the Breskens circuits.</p>\n<p>With 110km to go, the peloton split into three, and the increase in pace brought the early breakaway back. Immediately, the leading group of 16 opened up a gap.</p>\n<p>In the second escape was Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates), Tibor del Grosso and Gianni Vermeersch (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Paul Magnier (Soudal-Quickstep), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Stannard, Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiael), Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost), Ryan Mullen (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Frank Van den Broek (Picnic-PostNl), Krijnsen, Mike Teunissen (XDS Astana), Jarrad Drizners (Lotto), Kenneth Van Rooy (Wagner Bazin WB), Rick Pluimers (Tudor) and Axel Huens (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>Their lead never surpassed the minute mark, despite clockwork cooperation in the move, and the pace was furious in both the escape and chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>The breakaway split before the &#8216;green kilometre&#8217; &#8211; a series of three consecutive time bonus sprints with 25km to go. Oliveira followed a move by Vermeersch, with De Bondt and Drizners latching on.</p>\n<p>Oliveira won all three time bonuses and kept pressing on while Drizners and Vermeersch were brought back by the second breakaway group. With 18km to go, the attackers were all back together with less than a 30-second gap on the bunch behind.</p>\n<p>An attack from the breakaway by Stannard led to some hesitation from his former companions. As such, their lead was halved by the more motivated peloton. This caused panic in the breakaway, with Drizners attacking with Del Grosso.</p>\n<p>More hesitation and a furious pursuit behind inspired five riders to jump across to Drizners and Del Grosso, while the rest were caught &#8211; Vermeersch, Stuyven, Krijnsen, Teunissen, and Van den Broek.</p>\n<p>A crash in the peloton briefly disrupted the chase with 5.5km to go, but the leaders were reeled in half a kilometre later.</p>\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep controlled the final kilometres, and while Pavel Bittner (Picnic-PostNL) tried to open up the sprint early, Merlier easily overhauled him to win the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But in the end, it all came together, and the team did a really good job to bring me in a good position and I could launch my sprint in the right moment like I wanted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merlier&#8217;s team had an easier day with GC rider Paul Magnier in the day&#8217;s second breakaway, which forced other teams like Intermarch√©-Wanty to control the escape.</p>\n<p>The Renewi Tour is unique in that there are nine bonus seconds in three sprints inside what is called the &#8216;green kilometre&#8217;.</p>\n<p>While Merlier leads the overall classification with a ten-second time bonus for the victory, Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates) sits in second in the overall classification, two seconds behind Merlier after taking two of the sprints.</p>\n<p>Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), who gained seven seconds in time bonuses, is third, while De Lie is fourth at four seconds and Molano fifth at six seconds.</p>\n<p>The opening stage of the 2025 Renewi Tour, a flat 182.6km stage from Terneuzen to Breskens, seemed to go according to the usual early breakaway/sprint finish script, with seven riders attacking from the gun and getting a gap.</p>\n<p>The group included Robert Stannard (Bahrain Victorious), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost), Jelte Krijnsen (Jayco-AlUla), Siebe Deweirdt and Milan Lanhove (Flanders Baloise), Alexandre Van Petegem (Wagner Bazin WB), and Andreas Stokbro (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>Over the first 50km, the breakaway built up a lead of nearly two minutes, but in the middle of the stage, their advantage dropped precipitously as the peloton began to shatter in the crosswinds as the race entered the Breskens circuits.</p>\n<p>With 110km to go, the peloton split into three, and the increase in pace brought the early breakaway back. Immediately, the leading group of 16 opened up a gap.</p>\n<p>In the second escape was Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates), Tibor del Grosso and Gianni Vermeersch (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Paul Magnier (Soudal-Quickstep), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Stannard, Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiael), Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost), Ryan Mullen (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Frank Van den Broek (Picnic-PostNl), Krijnsen, Mike Teunissen (XDS Astana), Jarrad Drizners (Lotto), Kenneth Van Rooy (Wagner Bazin WB), Rick Pluimers (Tudor) and Axel Huens (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>Their lead never surpassed the minute mark, despite clockwork cooperation in the move, and the pace was furious in both the escape and chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>The breakaway split before the &#8216;green kilometre&#8217; &#8211; a series of three consecutive time bonus sprints with 25km to go. Oliveira followed a move by Vermeersch, with De Bondt and Drizners latching on.</p>\n<p>Oliveira won all three time bonuses and kept pressing on while Drizners and Vermeersch were brought back by the second breakaway group. With 18km to go, the attackers were all back together with less than a 30-second gap on the bunch behind.</p>\n<p>An attack from the breakaway by Stannard led to some hesitation from his former companions. As such, their lead was halved by the more motivated peloton. This caused panic in the breakaway, with Drizners attacking with Del Grosso.</p>\n<p>More hesitation and a furious pursuit behind inspired five riders to jump across to Drizners and Del Grosso, while the rest were caught &#8211; Vermeersch, Stuyven, Krijnsen, Teunissen, and Van den Broek.</p>\n<p>A crash in the peloton briefly disrupted the chase with 5.5km to go, but the leaders were reeled in half a kilometre later.</p>\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep controlled the final kilometres, and while Pavel Bittner (Picnic-PostNL) tried to open up the sprint early, Merlier easily overhauled him to win the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=21&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

When things began heating up, I tried to stay in the wheel of Cian, but at one point I had some difficulties, and decided to go at my own pace in order not to explode, making sure I could always see him,&#8221; said Lecerf.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the last 500 meters, as we were making inroads into that gap, I used a bit the slipstream of the others and gave everything I had, and managed to finish on the podium and take the GC win. I am happy I will take home the yellow jersey. It‚Äôs been a great week for us and it will be a race I will always remember.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 179km stage 4 delivered the expected GC showdown atop the punchy Pustevny climb, the second summit finish of the stage race.</p>\n<p>After around 70km of racing on the final stage of the Czech Tour, heading out of Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ to Pustevny, a 12-man group got away ahead of the first lap up what would be the finishing climb to Pustevny to form the breakaway. They had a four-minute lead with just under 100km remaining.</p>\n<p>It was made up of stage 3 winner Liam Walsh, Cameron Scott (CCACHE x BODYWRAP), Nicol√≤ Garibbo (UKYO), ≈†imon Van√≠ƒçek (ATT Investments), Michal Schuran (United Shipping), Michael Boro≈° (Elkov-Kasper), Patryk Stosz (Voster ATS), Lo√Øc Bettendorff (Hrinkow Advarics), Michiel van Vliet, Viego Tijssen (Metec &#8211; SOLARWATT p/b Mantel), Ond≈ôej Pokorn√Ω (TUFO-Pardus Prostƒõjov) and Dominik Amann (Vorarlberg).</p>\n<p>On the first of two ascents of the Pustevny (5.5km at 7.5%), two riders dropped the front group, while the escapees‚Äô advantage shrank from a maximum of four minutes to hover around the 2-minute mark inside of 50km to go.</p>\n<p>Visma Lease a Bike, working for Cian Uijtdebroeks, put two riders at the front of the peloton to control the gap and to put pressure on race leader Junior Lecerf (Soudal-Quickstep).</p>\n<p>Not liking the cooperation in the break, Walsh attacked solo with 41km to go, and quickly built a small gap to his former break companions. Bettendorf and Van Vliet gave chase and ultimately bridged up to the Australian, but with bonus seconds on offer at the finish, their fate was sealed.</p>\n<p>The trio was reeled back inside of 7km to go with the peloton driving to the bottom of the final climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) claimed the overall victory at the Tour de Romandie F√©minin in a nail-biting finish as Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) won the final undulating stage in Aigle in a three-up sprint.</p>\n<p>Chabbey finished third on the stage behind Vas and stage one winner Paula Blasi (UAE ADQ) to claim the first stage race victory of her career.</p>\n<p>Overnight leader Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal) was distanced on the final climb of the day, but chased valiantly in the final 10km to almost close the gap to the front three.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian came up short in the final kilometre and slipped to second on GC, with Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) finishing in third overall.</p>\n<p>At the climax of a hilly stage that started and finished near the UCI headquarters in Aigle, Chabbey unleashed a rapid burst of speed on the Antagnes climb 12 kilometres from the line, taking only Blasi with her as ≈Ωigart and Kastelijn struggled on the steepest pitches.</p>\n<p>Vas was able to get back on with an impressive descent and was always likely to be the fastest of the three if they made it to the line.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart may have made it back on, but for a mistake on the descent of Antagnes, giving the AG Insurance-Soudal rider too much to do in the closing stages.</p>\n<p>When the trio arrived at the final few hundred metres, Vas took her second win of the season after claiming the Hungarian national title for a sixth consecutive year in June.</p>\n<p>It was Chabbey, though, who had the widest smile of all as she claimed the biggest victory of her career just a stone‚Äôs throw from her childhood home in Geneva.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After yesterday, I was very happy,&#8221; Chabbey said after the stage, having won stage 2 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This morning, we said we have nothing to lose. We had a plan and we executed it well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted it to be hard on the climbs and for Juliette [Labous] to follow the attacks, and I could attack on the last climb. I wasn‚Äôt feeling that great, but then the team really pushed me. It‚Äôs a team win. It‚Äôs unbelievable.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the race finely poised heading into the final stage, multiple riders had the opportunity to clinch the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin yellow jersey on a lumpy day around the home of the UCI in Aigle.</p>\n<p>Just 13 seconds separated the top three on GC heading into the finale, with Chabbey and Kastelijn hoping to invent a plan to overhaul ≈Ωigart over the day‚Äôs 122 kilometres and five third-category climbs.</p>\n<p>The opening hour was played out over flat roads before the first of two ascents of Le Ch√¢tel (1.7km at 6.4%). A strong group of 13 riders moved away from the bunch, including the likes of 2022 champion Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), Claire Steels (Movistar) and Laura Stigger (SD Worx-Protime), who was the best-placed overall in 12th, 3:19 off the lead of ≈Ωigart.</p>\n<p>The leaders built an advantage of just over two minutes heading into the first climb, which was crested first by Morgane Coston (Roland Le D√©voluy) with the Queen of the Mountains jersey up for grabs. Steels rolled over the intermediate sprint in first place before the leaders approached La Rasse (2km at 8.8%), the second climb of the day. Steels attacked to score maximum points, putting herself within touching distance of the QOM jersey, held by ≈Ωigart. The Brit would go on to cross the line first on the second time up Le Ch√¢tel to draw level with ≈Ωigart.</p>\n<p>Behind, FDJ-SUEZ were applying pressure on Le Ch√¢tel, hoping to put Chabbey in the best position possible and to create problems for ≈Ωigart. They continued into the following 20km of flat road and brought the gap down to less than a minute with 30km and two more climbs to go, the bunch splitting as the wind howled into the valley.</p>\n<p>The leaders held a gap of 40 seconds heading into the stage‚Äôs penultimate climb, a second ascent of La Rasse. Before that, Steels had crossed another intermediate sprint in first to take over the lead of the points classification after her breakaway exploits in the previous stage. Steels‚Äô efforts paid off with the Brit going home with both the QOM and points jerseys. Stigger led onto the climb and drove the pace in an attempt to stay clear of the closing bunch. As Steels claimed the points over the top, the lead group had reduced to nine with a 30-second gap heading into the final 20km of the stage.</p>\n<p>With the gap closing, attacks began to fly from the 20-strong bunch behind. All was together heading into the final climb of Antagnes (1.2km @ 9%), which crested with 10km to go. Erica Magnaldi (UAE Team ADQ) was the first to attack, followed by Chabbey and several others. ≈Ωigart was initially slow to follow, but managed to close the gap to create a front group of six with the top three all there. Chabbey pushed on over the steepest section, taking stage one winner Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) with her, with ≈Ωigart and Kastelijn distanced by 15 seconds over the top with Blasi‚Äôs team-mate Magnaldi on the wheel.</p>\n<p>As Chabbey flew up front, ≈Ωigart made a mistake on the descent, going wide on a corner and losing the wheel of the now swollen chasing group. Chabbey was now in the driving seat with 4km to go, as Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime) closed down the leading pair. ≈Ωigart re-joined the chase shortly after and had a gap of 20 seconds to cross if she wanted to take her first WorldTour stage race victory.</p>\n<p>As the road dragged towards the final kilometre, the gap halved with ≈Ωigart herself pulling on the front with her team-mate Mireia Benito contributing what she could. With 1km left, the gap was just 8 seconds, and Vas and Blasi began to lean on Chabbey. However, the Swiss had enough to keep the chase at bay as ≈Ωigart faded behind.</p>\n<p>In the final 200 metres, Vas launched an impressive sprint to snatch victory on the final stage, with Blasi two bike lengths behind in second. Chabbey‚Äôs efforts were enough for her to claim the yellow jersey two weeks after winning the QOM jersey at the Tour de France Femmes, with ≈Ωigart‚Äôs group also containing third-placed Kastelijn, 11 seconds behind at the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the largest race of its kind in the country. Since 2015, the Czech Tour has been included in the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 series.</p>\n<p>Australian Liam Walsh (Ccache-Bodywrap) sprinted to the biggest win of his career, outpowering stage 1 winner Luke Lamperti (Soudal-Quickstep) on stage 3 of the Czech Tour. Marceli Boguslawski (ATT Investments) rounded out the podium in Ostrava.</p>\n<p>Sprinters‚Äô teams battled for position heading into the final corner with 500 metres to go, as Walsh took the corner wide, slotted into Lamperti‚Äôs wheel as they headed into the cobbled section to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Lamperti opened up his sprint early, but Walsh went around to claim the victory by a couple of bike lengths.</p>\n<p>With his massive acceleration, the 24-year-old rider took a surprise win for his Continental team, which mostly races in Asia. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm really proud of the way we&#8217;ve ridden this tour, and we didn&#8217;t quite get it right on stage one, but I think the racing we&#8217;ve done in Asia and the confidence we got from that has definitely helped us today,&#8221; said Walsh.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really glad that I can reward the team&#8217;s efforts, and we&#8217;ve got to win on our only tour in Europe this year, so I think we&#8217;re pretty happy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There were no changes to the GC with Junior Lecerf (Soudal-Quickstep) keeping the race lead with one stage to go. Alessandro Fancellu (JCL Team Ukyo) is four seconds down, and Cian Uijtdebroeks (Visma-Lease a Bike) is nine seconds in arrears, with a tough day of climbing to Pustevny awaiting the riders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really chaotic. Astana and Soudal were fighting for control through the final corner, and I was kind of caught in between with sprinters on their own on either side. And I had to punch through a few gaps and make some space. But the corner opened up for me, and I&#8217;m really pleased that when the road straightened out on the cobbles, that I had the legs to come over the top and to hold on, because it was rough, and Luke was really, really quick,&#8221; Walsh said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a really tough day. The chase was a bit on and off, and when the break kept going out, it became quite tough in the wheels, and the wind was up a little bit. So it definitely wasn&#8217;t the easiest day, particularly with how hot this tour has been and all the climbing yesterday.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stage 3, 148.4km from Prostƒõjov to Ostrava, featured just one classified climb at the 42km mark, was destined to finish with a bunch sprint.</p>\n<p>Following a flurry of attacks, the day‚Äôs breakaway escaped after 25 kilometres, and included mountains classification leader Nicolo Garibbo (JCL Team Ukyo), Mateusz Kostanski (Voster ATS), Lo√Øc Bettendorff (Hrinkow Advarics), Casper Van Der Woude (Metec-Solarwatt) and Dominik R√∂ber (Benotti-Berthold).</p>\n<p>Garibbo took the top KOM points atop the Kozlov (7.9 km at 4.3%) to solidify his lead in that competition, and then sat up, leaving the other four to continue on at the front. The peloton kept the quartet on a tight leash, never giving them more than a 2-minute lead.</p>\n<p>Led by a rider each from Soudal-Quickstep, XDS-Astana and Visma-Lease a Bike, the peloton had reduced the gap down to one minute with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>Not giving up, the break briefly stretched their lead to 1:25 on the rolling terrain of the Palkovick√© h≈Ørky Hills while Joris Reinderink launched from the peloton with 36km to go, even though he had a teammate in the break, only to be reeled in three kilometres later.</p>\n<p>Looking for a third stage win, Soudal-Quickstep, with race leader Junior Lecerf at the back of his team train, massed at the front of the peloton and gobbled up Bettendorff, the final breakaway rider, inside of 8km to go.</p>\n<p>The sprinters&#8217; teams, Soudal-Quickstep, Visma-Lease a Bike and XDS Astana, battled for position and control at the front of the pack, with Kern Pharma and ATT Investments moving up.

It is currently sponsored by the Danish national postal agency, PostNord, and the race is therefore also known as PostNord Danmark Rundt. The race is sometimes called the Tour of Denmark in English language media. The race has been on the UCI ProSeries calendar since 2021.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) closed out a dominant five days of racing perfectly to take overall victory at the Tour of Denmark, netting his third win on stage 5 in Silkeborg after a thrilling finale.</p>\n<p>Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) tried to upset the Lidl-Trek party and deny them a fourth win out of five stages, first marking a late surge by Pedersen, but being unable to come around him in the sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek lit up the racing in the final 12km, exploding the race into pieces up the climb to the finish line, which was taken on four times in laps of a local circuit. This left them with a numeric advantage in a late break of seven, with Pedersen being joined by teammates Jakob S√∂derqvist and S√∏ren Kragh Andersen.</p>\n<p>They continued to dictate the racing in the final two laps up the short rise to the line, with only Zingle looking like a real challenge to their dominance. In the end, Pedersen had just enough to deny the Frenchman in second, with S√∂derqvist finishing third on the day, which also moved him up to second on GC.</p>\n<p>There were several attacks launched on the road heading south out of Hobro, but eventually, an eight-man break found itself up the road, with a two-minute lead and 100km left to race: Jakob Fuglsang (Denmark), Marius Innhaug Dahl, Daniel Weis Nielsen (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Development Team), Mads Andersen (AIRTOX-Carl Ras), Filippo Ridolfo (Novo Nordisk), Conrad Haugsted, Anders Vos S√∏rensen (ColoQuick) and Mads Landbo (Give Steel-2M Cycling Elite).</p>\n<p>The break stayed together into the final 40km, with Haugsted dropping back after fighting for KOM points, and Andersen going on the attack solo. The peloton was gradually ramping up in pace, just one minute behind, with undulating roads approaching Silkeborg offering attacking chances.</p>\n<p>Andersen was the last to be caught 17km from the finish, ending the breakaway as the race entered the circuit laps of the finish in the centre of Jutland.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek ripped things up with 13km remaining, creating big splits in the field as they pushed on with four riders in a line, with Mattias Skjelmose first and then Mads Pedersen exploding things.</p>\n<p>Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) held the wheel, with Slovakian national champion Luk√°≈° Kubi≈° (Unibet Tietema Rockets) bridging across solo. It became a group of seven soon after, with Maty√°≈° Kopeck√Ω (Novo Nordisk) and second-place GC rider Niklas Larsen (BHS-PL Beton Bornholm) also making it.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek smashed things again up the next lap up the climb with 6km remaining, as Jakob S√∂derqvist and Pedersen continued to ride, seemingly, for Danish national champion S√∏ren Kragh Andersen. This did for Kubi≈° and Larsen.</p>\n<p>The race leaders changed tack up the final rep of the climb, with Kragh Andersen taking over, and soon Pedersen launched an attack with only Zingle able to follow heading into the last few hundred metres.</p>\n<p>With the Visma rider on his wheel, this prompted Pedersen to slow momentarily, allowing S√∂derqvist and Kopecky to come back and then Kragh Andersen at speed. The Danish champion led around the final corner, giving Pedersen a final lead-out.</p>\n<p>Zingle managed to escape getting boxed in by the Lidl-Trek riders and found a lane to sprint against the race leader. But despite his speed, he was unable to overtake Pedersen and had to settle for second place on the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is currently sponsored by the Danish national postal agency, PostNord, and the race is therefore also known as PostNord Danmark Rundt. The race is sometimes called the Tour of Denmark in English language media. The race has been on the UCI ProSeries calendar since 2021.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) closed out a dominant five days of racing perfectly to take overall victory at the Tour of Denmark, netting his third win on stage 5 in Silkeborg after a thrilling finale.</p>\n<p>Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) tried to upset the Lidl-Trek party and deny them a fourth win out of five stages, first marking a late surge by Pedersen, but being unable to come around him in the sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek lit up the racing in the final 12km, exploding the race into pieces up the climb to the finish line, which was taken on four times in laps of a local circuit. This left them with a numeric advantage in a late break of seven, with Pedersen being joined by teammates Jakob S√∂derqvist and S√∏ren Kragh Andersen.</p>\n<p>They continued to dictate the racing in the final two laps up the short rise to the line, with only Zingle looking like a real challenge to their dominance. In the end, Pedersen had just enough to deny the Frenchman in second, with S√∂derqvist finishing third on the day, which also moved him up to second on GC.</p>\n<p>There were several attacks launched on the road heading south out of Hobro, but eventually, an eight-man break found itself up the road, with a two-minute lead and 100km left to race: Jakob Fuglsang (Denmark), Marius Innhaug Dahl, Daniel Weis Nielsen (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Development Team), Mads Andersen (AIRTOX-Carl Ras), Filippo Ridolfo (Novo Nordisk), Conrad Haugsted, Anders Vos S√∏rensen (ColoQuick) and Mads Landbo (Give Steel-2M Cycling Elite).</p>\n<p>The break stayed together into the final 40km, with Haugsted dropping back after fighting for KOM points, and Andersen going on the attack solo. The peloton was gradually ramping up in pace, just one minute behind, with undulating roads approaching Silkeborg offering attacking chances.</p>\n<p>Andersen was the last to be caught 17km from the finish, ending the breakaway as the race entered the circuit laps of the finish in the centre of Jutland.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek ripped things up with 13km remaining, creating big splits in the field as they pushed on with four riders in a line, with Mattias Skjelmose first and then Mads Pedersen exploding things.</p>\n<p>Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) held the wheel, with Slovakian national champion Luk√°≈° Kubi≈° (Unibet Tietema Rockets) bridging across solo. It became a group of seven soon after, with Maty√°≈° Kopeck√Ω (Novo Nordisk) and second-place GC rider Niklas Larsen (BHS-PL Beton Bornholm) also making it.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek smashed things again up the next lap up the climb with 6km remaining, as Jakob S√∂derqvist and Pedersen continued to ride, seemingly, for Danish national champion S√∏ren Kragh Andersen. This did for Kubi≈° and Larsen.</p>\n<p>The race leaders changed tack up the final rep of the climb, with Kragh Andersen taking over, and soon Pedersen launched an attack with only Zingle able to follow heading into the last few hundred metres.</p>\n<p>With the Visma rider on his wheel, this prompted Pedersen to slow momentarily, allowing S√∂derqvist and Kopecky to come back and then Kragh Andersen at speed. The Danish champion led around the final corner, giving Pedersen a final lead-out.</p>\n<p>Zingle managed to escape getting boxed in by the Lidl-Trek riders and found a lane to sprint against the race leader. But despite his speed, he was unable to overtake Pedersen and had to settle for second place on the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=32&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Elise Chabbey (FDJ-Suez) took her first WorldTour victory on stage 2 of the Tour de Romandie F√©minin, unleashing a burst of speed in the final hundred metres of the summit finish to La Tzoumaz to beat Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal), who moved into the overall lead of the race.</p>\n<p>The pair were locked together for the entirety of the 12km ascent, with Chabbey only able to break the deadlock in the two-up sprint to win by three seconds. Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck) fought bravely to cross the line three further seconds behind ≈Ωigart in third.</p>\n<p>Overnight race leader Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) and race favourite Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez) were distanced early on under the pressure of the tempo set by AG Insurance-Soudal on a tough day in the Swiss Alps.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart now holds an eight-second lead over Chabbey heading into the final stage, with Kastelijn 13 seconds back in third.</p>\n<p>Chabbey grew up in Geneva, a short distance away from the ski resort of La Tzoumaz. She was understandably delighted to pick up the biggest win of her career close to home despite some sickness after claiming the Queen of the Mountains jersey at the Tour de France Femmes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs the most beautiful victory of my career,&#8221; said Chabbey after the finish. &#8220;With my family here, my sisters and brothers. The team was behind me. I can‚Äôt believe it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was sick after the Tour de France. I didn‚Äôt recover well. I came because it‚Äôs a home race.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Chabbey also commented on the situation before the opening stage, when five teams were disqualified for refusing to comply with a UCI GPS safety tracking test.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs sad for the organisation, what happened yesterday. The organisation don‚Äôt have a lot of money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With an easier day on the cards on the final stage, Chabbey recognised that overhauling ≈Ωigart for the yellow jersey would be difficult, but she will try to attack the Slovenian on the stage starting and finishing in Aigle, home to the UCI.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nYoung Paula Blasi held a surprise 17-second overnight lead in the overall classification heading into the toughest stage of the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin after her prologue victory on the opening day. Her win in Villars-sur-Ollon was impressive, but with a 12.8km finishing climb to La Tzoumaz, the second stage was a different proposition altogether.</p>\n<p>The stage was mostly flat, apart from the double ascent of the third category Chamoson climb, breaking up the mid-part of the day. The riders knew the stage, and probably the entire race, was all about the final climb.</p>\n<p>As a result, there was little in the way of breakaway action early on. The first movement of the stage was the first of four intermediate sprints at Leytron after 34km ‚Äì which didn‚Äôt carry bonus seconds. Margot Vanpachtenbeke (VolkerWessels) won the opening dash, which bounced straight into the first ascent of Chamoson. Kastelijn, fourth in the prologue, sprang out of the pack to take maximum points, showing ambition for the climber‚Äôs jersey.</p>\n<p>Then came the first real attempt at a breakaway. It was Claire Steels (Movistar) who attacked the pack solo. She was soon followed by Giorgia Vettorello (Roland Le D√©voluy), but the Italian was stuck in no-man&#8217;s-land between the lead and the bunch. Steel and Vettorello would go on to take the first two places at the repeated intermediate sprint and Queen of the Mountains point. With 10km left before the bottom of La Tzoumaz, Steels had a lead of more than two minutes over the bunch, while Vettorello was dangling ahead of the peloton heading through the penultimate sprint in Aproz.</p>\n<p>As Steels continued through the final sprint in Riddes and onto La Tzoumaz, she held a lead of 90 seconds. Steels, an accomplished climber, got quickly into her rhythm on the steady 8% gradients. Behind, UAE Team ADQ took up the pace-making in support of race leader Blasi as the weaker climbers were shelled out the back. The group soon reduced to around 20 riders.</p>\n<p>Steels‚Äô lead melted away, and she was quickly swept up as Liv-AlUla Jayco lifted the pace through Caroline Andersson, looking to set up Mavi Garc√≠a. With 10km left, Andersson stopped her work, and responsibility went back into the hands of UAE Team-ADQ, who were in a strong position with five riders in the top-20 overall. AG Insurance-Soudal also contributed in support of ≈Ωigart as the race was being decided by riders going off the back. African champion Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), the winner of the first edition of this race, was dropped with 9km left alongside 8th-placed Alena Ivanchenko (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Under the pressure of AG Insurance-Soudal‚Äôs Mireia Benito, race favourite Juliette Labous was distanced with 8km left. The FDJ-SUEZ rider was in a group alongside Garc√≠a, but was attempting to fight back to the leading group.</p>\n<p>Leader Blasi was the next to go a kilometre later, as the advantage swung heavily in favour of AG Insurance-Soudal and ≈Ωigart, with Benito putting in a monster turn on the front. Just five riders remained in the leading group, with Kastelijn, Steffi H√§berlin (SD Worx-ProTime) and Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) alongside Benito and ≈Ωigart. With 6km left, Labous was well distanced, and Blasi was fading fast. The win would be fought out between this quintet, all five of whom were separated by 25 seconds in the overall standings heading into the stage.</p>\n<p>≈Ωigart looked strong and attacked with 5.5km to go, immediately dropping Swiss champion H√§berlin and team-mate Benito, whose mammoth job for the day was complete. Kastelijn and Chabbey were able to follow the first acceleration, but the Dutchwoman was soon swinging off the back under the pressure of ≈Ωigart. She was dropped and dangled around 50 metres behind, but ≈Ωigart had more trouble with distancing Chabbey.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian continued to apply the tempo, with Chabbey lurking behind. The Swiss was sitting 15 seconds behind her companion heading into the stage, so she needed to attack if she wanted to take the yellow jersey. With 2km left, ≈Ωigart lifted her foot off the gas for the first time, forcing Chabbey through as Kastelijn tried to close the gap. ≈Ωigart came back to the front as they entered the final two kilometres, parts of which pitched above 9%.</p>\n<p>The pair were locked together moving into the final kilometre, with the gradient easing in the final few hundred metres. Chabbey kicked with 150 metres to go and immediately opened a gap on a tired-looking ≈Ωigart, with Kastelijn closing in behind.</p>\n<p>The local rider punched the air as she recorded her biggest ever victory on home roads. ≈Ωigart moves into a slim lead, with a punchy day starting and finishing in Aigle to conclude the race on stage 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the largest race of its kind in the country. Since 2015, the Czech Tour has been included in the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 series.</p>\n<p>22-year-old Junior Lecerf has taken a second victory in as many days for Soudal-QuickStep in the Czech Tour, cleverly profiting from all the hard work by Cian Uijtdebroeks (Visma-Lease a Bike) on the final category 1 climb of Dlouh√© Stranƒõ to snatch a summit finish victory from his fellow Belgian.</p>\n<p>In a lead group of three, Uijtdebroeks started the sprint close to 300 metres to go, but Lecerf, having followed the Visma racer&#8217;s wheel all the way up the Dlouh√© Str√°nƒõ as he shredded the field, was instantly able to counter.</p>\n<p>Lecerf then maintained his ferocious uphill pace on the last part of the climb, crossing the line ahead of Alessandro Fancellu (Team UTKO) and a fading Uijtdebroeks.</p>\n<p>Thanks to his victory, the young Soudal-QuickStep racer also inherited the leader&#8217;s jersey from teammate Luke Lamperti, with a six second advantage on Fancellu and nine on Uijtdebroeks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This feels amazing,&#8221; Lecerf said, &#8220;I worked hard for this and to be rewarded &#8211; it&#8217;s perfect. The team did a great job controlling things, so many thanks to them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was ok on Cian&#8217;s wheel, our tactic was to just follow today and trust in the sprint and it worked out so I&#8217;m really happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew the climb from 2021 and 2022 from the Peace Race, so that helped. It meant I timed my sprint well, I didn&#8217;t hesitate and I took the victory. And tomorrow [a flat stage] we can go for the win again with Luke.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the lengthy rolling opening segment of the stage, an eight-rider early break never gained more than an advantage of just over five minutes, and the final survivor, Kyrylo Tsarenko (Solution Tech-Vini Fantini), was reeled in by the Visma-Lease a Bike-led peloton with more than half of the Dlouh√© Str√°nƒõ to go.</p>\n<p>Overnight leader Lamperti had already fallen back in the opening kilometres of the one major classified climb of the day, and the blistering pace set by Visma then split the peloton completely, leaving seven riders ahead. Three of them were from the Dutch WorldTour squad, with recent Tour de l&#8217;Ain winner Uijtdebroeks opening up the late charges. However, young Colombian Santiago Umba (XDS Astana Devo&#8217;) made an impressive counterattack, forcing Uijtdebroeks to return to the fray.</p>\n<p>The Belgian&#8217;s display of power proved a two-edged weapon, as another relatively unknown rider, Alessandro Fancellu from the Continental UTKO team, opened up a gap and once again made the Visma rider work hard on the front of the five-strong lead group, with everyone else content to sit back and let him get on with it. But although Uijtdebroeks&#8217; efforts subsequently reduced the group from five to three, he was seemingly finding it impossible to drop Lecerf, nor &#8211; even more surprisingly &#8211; Fancellu.</p>\n<p>Uijtdebroeks was looking more and more like a victim of his own strength, and when Lecerf delivered his blistering long uphill acceleration, he was unable to respond. Fancellu, meanwhile, was able to stay in touch with the two WorldTour riders and, having taken second, remains another possible challenger for overall victory.</p>\n<p>The sprinters will likely get back into the thick of the action on Saturday&#8217;s stage 3, a much flatter run from 148.4 kilometre run from Prostejov to Ostrava, prior to Sunday&#8217;s showdown second summit finish, the shorter but much punchier Pustevny climb.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15209&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland ‚Äì using roads in the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges.</p>\n<p>Paula Blasi (UAE Team ADQ) blasted to a breakthrough victory in the 4.4km hilly prologue of the Tour de Romandie F√©minin, although her success was almost completely overshadowed by a major dispute that erupted earlier that day between various top teams on the race and the UCI, leading to their expulsion.</p>\n<p>The 22-year-old completed the course in 11:17 to record her first WorldTour victory in her first professional season.</p>\n<p>Blasi held off the challenge of Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ), who finished second and third, 17 and 18 seconds down, respectively.</p>\n<p>The shape of the race had already shifted before the first rider rolled down the ramp in Hu√©moz, as five major teams were disqualified after they refused to take part in a UCI test of GPS safety tracking technology.</p>\n<p>Race favourites such as Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney of Canyon-SRAM-zondacrypto and Lidl-Trek‚Äôs Niamh Fisher-Black did not take to the start. The three other squads who are out of the race are EF Education-Oatly, Picnic-PostNL and Team Visma-Lease a Bike.</p>\n<p>The absence of the quintet of disqualified squads blew the race open. Blasi took full advantage to take the biggest win of her young career and move into the yellow jersey. The Spanish rider moved into road cycling late after a junior career as a runner and duathlete and surprised even herself with the result.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was not expecting to be up there,&#8221; Blasi said in the TV interview after the finish.<br />\n&#8220;I knew I was in good shape, I come from altitude [camp], but for sure my main goal is preparing for l‚ÄôAvenir, so I still have some days. Tour of Romandie was kind of let&#8217;s see how I start, and of course, I always go full gas, but I didn&#8217;t expect this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was really looking for the white jersey, the young one, because I thought it was the more accessible one and the one I could be more close to, but then when I arrived to the finish line and they said &#8211; &#8216;No, no, you actually have to have the best time.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was like, well, OK, let&#8217;s sit down and wait, but I didn&#8217;t believe it until the last one crossed the finish line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked about the situation with the other teams dropping out of the race, Blasi had mixed emotions; grateful for a better opportunity to win, while also wanting to race against the best possible opposition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit sad, it&#8217;s a bit of a pity, because of course we always want the biggest competitors, so there is more to watch and more ambition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the other hand, it&#8217;s also good for us, because maybe the level will not be as high, so we can play a little bit more. But we always want the best in the race, so it&#8217;s a little bit sad that we don&#8217;t have these big teams in the race.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith five teams out of the race due to their refusal to take part in the UCI‚Äôs GPS tracking test, there was a significant element of the unknown heading into the first of three days of racing through the French-speaking region of Switzerland. Furthermore, hilly prologues are a regular feature in the men‚Äôs Tour de Romandie, but it was only in its fourth edition that the Tour de Romandie F√©minin peloton took on a short, sharp individual test in its opening stage for the first time. With much of the stage on gradients above 10%, this would certainly be a day for the climbers.</p>\n<p>SD Worx-ProTime‚Äôs Mikayla Harvey set the first time under the 12-minute mark early on in the day, but was soon pipped by less than two seconds by youngster Alena Ivanchencko (UAE Team ADQ). Both would go on to finish the stage in the top 10.</p>\n<p>The more recognised climbing talent started later on in the stage. Ivanchencko‚Äôs team-mate Erica Magnaldi edged ahead before being beaten by ≈Ωigart, who finished in 11:34 as the GC favourites began to threaten. The only former Romandie champion on the start-list, Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), who won the first edition in 2022, was off the pace of the best, finishing almost a minute behind Blasi.</p>\n<p>Blasi continued her excellent run in her first WorldTour season by eclipsing ≈Ωigart by 17 seconds, finishing in a time of 11:17 and leading as the likes of team-mate Silvia Persico, Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), and Mavi Garcia (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) attacked the 4.4km course. Persico may have come into the race as the team‚Äôs leader on paper, but she was well short of the mark set by her young teammate.</p>\n<p>Blasi is a winner of three UCI races this year and was fourth overall at the 2024 Tour de l‚ÄôAvenir Femmes, and she looked set to record a breakthrough result in Villars-sur-Ollon. Kastelijn was closer, but faded in the closing stages to finish 25 seconds shy, in third as it stood. Garc√≠a was over a minute down before Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) climbed into the top 10 on the stage.</p>\n<p>Just two riders remained to topple Blasi: Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-ProTime) and Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p>Labous was tipped as the main favourite after the drop-outs. She looked powerful as she took on the stage‚Äôs steepest sections in a solid, seated style, only occasionally getting out of the saddle to squeeze the power out of her legs.</p>\n<p>Bredewold was less suited to the tougher parts, but would look to take advantage of the flatter final third of the parcours. However, the climbing section had taken its toll on the Dutch champion. She crossed the line almost a minute down, just inside the top 20. It was a strong ride by Labous, but she wasn‚Äôt able to do enough to dethrone Blasi, who took the biggest victory of her young career, with Labous taking the final step on the podium.</p>\n<p>Blasi, clearly delighted by her triumph, fist-pumped the air in the leader‚Äôs hot seat and will go into the first road stage of the 2025 Tour de Romandie F√©minin in the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16500&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It consists of seven or eight stages and is usually around 1,200 km in length. The race was first held in 1928 and is considered the oldest and most important bicycle race in Poland.</p>\n<p>Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) took overall victory in the Tour de Pologne with a perfectly-executed performance in the final 12.5km time trial around Wieliczka near Krakow in southern Poland.</p>\n<p>McNulty raced with stars-and-stripes bands on the arms of his UAE skinsuit as a former USPro ITT national champion and used his world-class time trial skills to set a time of 14:31 to win the stage.</p>\n<p>He was 46 faster than stage 6 winner and race leader Victor Langellotti (Ineos Grenadiers) and so won the Tour de Pologne by a comfortable margin.</p>\n<p>2023 under-23 world time trial champion Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar) warmed the hot seat for a long time but ultimately finished 12 seconds slower than McNulty. Matteo Sobrero (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was third at 15 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) set a time of 14:47 to finish fourth on the stage and so second overall at 29 seconds. Sobrero moved up to third at 37 seconds as Langellotti tumbled to fifth overall at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de Pologne has often included a time trial and this year&#8217;s race ended with a 12.5km test that started and finished near the ‚ÄúWieliczka‚Äù Salt Mine in southern Poland. The course started with a gradual two-kilometre climb before a hilltop sector and a gradual and fast descent back to the finish.</p>\n<p>Last year, thanks in part to a good time trial, Jonas Vingegaard secured overall victory at the Tour de Pologne. This year the time trial decided the overall winner after a week of close racing and a fight for every second.</p>\n<p>Due to illness and a number of abandons, only 115 started the time trial but many raced at 100% in a final day of competition.</p>\n<p>Britain&#8217;s Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost) set the early fastest time of 15:02, covering the course at an average of 49.69 kph. Artz Huub (Intermarch√©-Wanty) went eight sections faster and set 14:54 but soon after stage 3 winner Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) beat him with a time of 14:50. Turner raced in the white points jersey and then sat in the hot seat watching his rivals try to beat him.</p>\n<p>Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) is a renowned time trialist but only returned to racing in Pologne after missing the Tour de France. He was one vital second slower than Turner in 14:51.</p>\n<p>2023 under-23 world time trial champion Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar) was faster at the intermediate time check after six kilometres and eventually took the hot seat from Turner, stopping the clock in a time of 14:43 and racing at an average of 50.759 kph.</p>\n<p>Matteo Sobrero (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) is a former Italian time trial champion and won the final time trial stage of the 2022 Giro d&#8217;Italia. He impressed in Poland as he fought for a place on the podium of the final GC but was three seconds slower than his compatriot Milesi. However his effort was worth it.</p>\n<p>Alberto Bettiol (XDS-Astana) took a risk on a late roundabout, cutting across a cobbled sector. He finished all out but was 14 seconds slower than Milesi in a time of 14:57 but moved up to sixth overall at 47 seconds.</p>\n<p>Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) finished 12th in the time trial but that was enough to defend his fourth place overall at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p>McNulty showed his intentions at the first time split, going 18 seconds faster than Milesi after six kilometres. The American was powerful and composed, carefully judging his lines and performance. He soon stopped the clock in a time of 14:31 and only needed to wait for his overall victory to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>Langellotti started last in a full yellow skinsuit as race leader. He knew he was racing to try to hold onto the race lead but could do nothing to stop McNulty ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Langellotti was timed at 32 second down on McNulty at the time split. He perhaps knew his chances of victory were gone but raced all out to the finish. He set a time of 15:17, slipping down the GC to fifth at 39 seconds. The daily and overall spoils went to McNulty and UAE yet again.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Let&#8217;s see what we can do.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 182km third stage of the Arctic Race of Norway was expected to shake-up the GC standings before Sunday&#8217;s hilly final stage, with the 3.7km, 7.8% climb to the finish in M√•lselv offering a chance to create time gaps.</p>\n<p>The stage started in Hus√∏y, inside the Arctic Circle and headed south from the edge of the Norwegian sea via fjords and stunning country roads.</p>\n<p>The stage was ideal for a long breakaway attempt and four local riders took their chance and got away soon after the start.</p>\n<p>Morthen Wang Baksaas (Team Ringerikskraft), Sebastian Veslum (Norway), Storm Ingebrigtsen (Team Coop-Repsol) and Georg Rydningen Martinsen (Lillehammer CK Continental Team).</p>\n<p>Wang Baksaas was the first to top of the early Hus√∏y climb and so won 100kg of salmon. His surge also helped the break get a gap and so the narrative of the stage was set.</p>\n<p>Ingebrigtsen and Baksaas fought for the mountains points during the stage as Veslum fought for the intermediate sprints.</p>\n<p>The quartet opened a lead of 1:30 after a few kilometres and their work and lack of chase in the peloton meant it increased as the stage evolved. Only Q36.5 were willing to put a rider on the front to make the chase, the peloton convinced that Tom Pidcock was the favourite for the stage victory.</p>\n<p>The gap was timed at 2:20 with 60km as the chase increased the pace and tried to keep the attackers under control. With 30km to go, it was down to 1:30, as the four riders attacked each other rather than working smoothly together. Ingebrigtsen even sat on, perhaps under team orders, which slowed the attackers even more.</p>\n<p>Q36.5 rode on the front and lined-out the peloton on the rolling forest roads, with other teams finally joining the chase. That quickly reduced the gap and so with 20km to go, only Veslum remained out front by a few seconds. In another twist, rain began to fall on the race, further raising the tension.</p>\n<p>Veslum was eventually caught with nine kilometres to go, after a 173km attack.</p>\n<p>Pidcock was strangely at the back of the peloton after suffering a mechanical problem with 10km to go. The Q36.5 leader was forced to chase in the cars but was back in the peloton as the pace accelerated to the foot of the climb to the finish.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 winner Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X) did a big turn for his teammates and then the climb began to hurt as the riders passed the parked convoy of their team camper vans. The Arctic Race of Norway is so far north of central Europe that teams do not send their usual team buses.</p>\n<p>Davide Ballerini (Astana-XDS) hit the front with three kilometres to go, riding for his teammate Christian Scaroni. Q36.5 soon took over with Milan Vader leading Pidcock. The Yorkshireman was expected to attack but instead hesitated, letting Strong catch his breath.</p>\n<p>Pidcock finally made his move with 1.2km but Strong got on his wheel, as everyone else was distanced. Strong suffered and suffered even more in Pidcock&#8217;s slipstream but it was worth it. The two finished together and so Strong kept the Midnight sun leader&#8217;s jersey for the final day.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=259&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=259&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

His surge also helped the break get a gap and so the narrative of the stage was set.</p>\n<p>Ingebrigtsen and Baksaas fought for the mountains points during the stage as Veslum fought for the intermediate sprints.</p>\n<p>The quartet opened a lead of 1:30 after a few kilometres and their work and lack of chase in the peloton meant it increased as the stage evolved. Only Q36.5 were willing to put a rider on the front to make the chase, the peloton convinced that Tom Pidcock was the favourite for the stage victory.</p>\n<p>The gap was timed at 2:20 with 60km as the chase increased the pace and tried to keep the attackers under control. With 30km to go, it was down to 1:30, as the four riders attacked each other rather than working smoothly together. Ingebrigtsen even sat on, perhaps under team orders, which slowed the attackers even more.</p>\n<p>Q36.5 rode on the front and lined-out the peloton on the rolling forest roads, with other teams finally joining the chase. That quickly reduced the gap and so with 20km to go, only Veslum remained out front by a few seconds. In another twist, rain began to fall on the race, further raising the tension.</p>\n<p>Veslum was eventually caught with nine kilometres to go, after a 173km attack.</p>\n<p>Pidcock was strangely at the back of the peloton after suffering a mechanical problem with 10km to go. The Q36.5 leader was forced to chase in the cars but was back in the peloton as the pace accelerated to the foot of the climb to the finish.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 winner Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X) did a big turn for his teammates and then the climb began to hurt as the riders passed the parked convoy of their team camper vans. The Arctic Race of Norway is so far north of central Europe that teams do not send their usual team buses.</p>\n<p>Davide Ballerini (Astana-XDS) hit the front with three kilometres to go, riding for his teammate Christian Scaroni. Q36.5 soon took over with Milan Vader leading Pidcock. The Yorkshireman was expected to attack but instead hesitated, letting Strong catch his breath.</p>\n<p>Pidcock finally made his move with 1.2km but Strong got on his wheel, as everyone else was distanced. Strong suffered and suffered even more in Pidcock&#8217;s slipstream but it was worth it. The two finished together and so Strong kept the Midnight sun leader&#8217;s jersey for the final day.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=259&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=259&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race was first held in 1928 and is considered the oldest and most important bicycle race in Poland.</p>\n<p>Victor Langellotti (Ineos Grenadiers) snatched the stage victory from Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) on the uphill finish to Bukowina Tatrza≈Ñska at the Tour de Pologne, to take a historic win for the Montecarlo rider.</p>\n<p>McNulty was disappointed to be caught in sight of the finish but the American took six bonus seconds and gained more seconds on Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) before their expected clash in Sunday&#8217;s final time trial.</p>\n<p>Langellotti took a 10-second time bonus for his victory and so took the leader&#8217;s yellow jersey, 10 seconds ahead of McNulty.

The Frenchman was distanced but fought back on as the riders started the final 50km of racing.</p>\n<p>The flat roads created a moment of pause in hostilities as teams waited for the climb to the line.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck tried to force a split with 30km to go but were soon kept in check, as UAE again rode on the front with Vermeersch.</p>\n<p>UAE&#8217;s strategy became clearer at the intermediate sprint with 18km to go. UAE and Bahrain Victorious massed on the front and then McNulty charged away to take the three-second time bonus. Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) took two seconds.

The men&#8217;s Vuelta a Burgos has been a multi-day stage race as part of the UCI Europe Tour since 2005.</p>\n<p>Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) soloed to the seventh win of his career on stage 4 of the Vuelta a Burgos, attacking the day‚Äôs breakaway over the final climb of the day, the Alto del Cargadero, 17km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Caruso left behind a group including Rui Costa (EF Education-EasyPost) and Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) from the main break of the stage, which jumped clear of the peloton 20km into the 162.7km stage.</p>\n<p>His superior climbing ability saw him quickly pull out a minute‚Äôs gap on the steep final section of the Cargadeto, an advantage he‚Äôd only extend on the downhill.</p>\n<p>After Caruso&#8217;s solo ride and victory in Regumiel de la Sierra, there&#8217;d be a 1:26 wait for second place, with Costa taking the spot ahead of Rui Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) amid a four-man sprint for the remaining podium places.</p>\n<p>Further back, the peloton, which lay three minutes down for much of the final 30km and posed no threat to the breakaway, rolled home at 3:15 after Caruso had crossed the line, with H√©ctor Alvarez (Lidl-Trek) leading the group home.</p>\n<p>With the breakaway riders having no impact on the race&#8217;s general classification, the overall race lead stays with L√©o Bisiaux (Decathlon AG2R L Mondiale)</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe fourth stage of the Vuelta a Burgos, a hilly 162.7km run from Do√±a Santos to Regumiel de la Sierra, would give the peloton 2,300 metres of climbing to deal with in addition to two third-category climbs ‚Äì the Alto del Collado de Vilviestre (5.3km at 3.8%) and the Alto del Cargadero (7.6km at 2.9%) ‚Äì inside the final 40km.</p>\n<p>The hills began at the very start of the day with uncategorised climbs filling the first two-thirds of the stage. The first hills of the day provided a perfect launchpad for the day&#8217;s breakaway.</p>\n<p>It took 20km for the break to go clear, with Ben Zwiehoff joined by Damiano Caruso and Rui Costa. out front.</p>\n<p>The trio were swiftly joined by Larry Warbasse (Tudor), Javier Romo (Movistar) and Nickolas Zukowsky (Q36.5), with the peloton letting the six up the road with a 1:40 advantage.</p>\n<p>Behind the break, however, Jos√© Mart√≠a Garc√≠a (Illes Balears Arabay) and Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek) attempted to bridge the gap with moves 35km into the stage. The pair struggled to make it across, however, lying 45 seconds off the leaders at the 100km to go mark as the peloton raced four minutes down.</p>\n<p>That was the closest the duo would Garc√≠a and Bernard would get to joining the break, however, as they ended up drifting backwards during the mid-section of the stage before they were reabsorbed by the peloton with 60km left to run.</p>\n<p>The seven leaders continued, however, carrying a 3:30 gap into the final 40km and over the day&#8217;s first climb, the Alto del Collado de Vilviestre. Over the top, Caruso picked up six points to move into the virtual mountain classification lead.</p>\n<p>Despite Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale chasing behind, the peloton wasn&#8217;t able to make much headway into the break&#8217;s lead, with the move still holding three minutes as they raced into the final 20km.</p>\n<p>The earlier slopes of the day&#8217;s final climb, the Alto del Cargadero, played host to the first big moves from the breakaway as Caruso went on the offensive. Zwiehoff went with him, but the German didn&#8217;t have enough to hang on as 37-year-old Caruso pushed on alone.</p>\n<p>Facing the last 17km alone, Caruso held an advantage of over a minute at the top of the climb ‚Äì where he picked up another six mountain points ‚Äì while back down the road, Zwiehoff, Oliveira, and Costa led the chase.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t to be for those men fighting to drag Caruso back, though. The Italian veteran held more than enough time down the descent of the Cargadero to ensure a solo ride to the finish and a first win since the 2022 Giro di Sicilia.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The men&#8217;s Vuelta a Burgos has been a multi-day stage race as part of the UCI Europe Tour since 2005.</p>\n<p>L√©o Bisiaux (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) soloed to victory and the race lead on stage 3 of the Vuelta a Burgos, attacking from a group of five in the final kilometre to take the win in Valpuesta.</p>\n<p>Sprinting from the group behind, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) took second, whilst Giulio Pellizzari (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) finished third as the chasers finished some 10 seconds behind the Frenchman who attacked at the perfect moment.</p>\n<p>A group of five riders ‚Äì Bisiaux, Ciccone, Pellizzari, Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) ‚Äì went clear on the final climb, the Puerto de Ordu√±a 20km from the finish, and held off a chasing group all the way to the line to battle for victory between themselves.</p>\n<p>It looked like it was going to be a five-way sprint, but Bisiaux attacked early in the final kilometre and no one responded.</p>\n<p>Bisiaux takes over the lead of the race from stage 1 winner Roger Adri√† (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who was dropped early on the final climb.</p>\n<p>This is the 20-year-old Frenchman&#8217;s first victory of 2025, and with it the purple leaders&#8217; jersey, which he will wear on stage 4 with a 22-second gap over Pellizzzari in second, whilst third overall is Del Toro, 26 seconds down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAs the race rolled out of it took some time for the break of the day to form, but it eventually did, made up of six riders: Sander De Pestel (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Gorka Sorarrain (Caja Rural-Seguros-RGA), Hugo Aznar (Equipo Kern Pharma), Iker Mintegi (Euskadi-Euskatel), Daniel Cavia (Burgos Burpellet BH) and Mario Silva (Illes Balears Arabay). They quickly built up a healthy four-minute lead and were ahead for much of the day.</p>\n<p>The break began to split slightly going into the final 60km and the first of the three final climbs, with De Pestel and Sorarrin eventually forging clear of their companions. Behind, as the race approached the final 40km, the peloton started to accelerate to chase down the group, bringing the gap down to two minutes and rapidly falling.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the Alto de las Campas, Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) attacked out of the peloton in what seemed like a leg-testing exercise as much as anything, for the Spaniard returning from serious injury. He got a gap of around 20 seconds on the peloton, but was soon reeled back in and subsequently dropped.</p>\n<p>With 28km to go, De Pestel pushed ahead of Sorarrin on the final climb, but only had a small gap. Halfway up the climb, race leader Roger Adri√† was dropped from the peloton, whilst Giulio Ciccone pushed on up front, followed by L√©o Bisiaux. Three kilometres from the top of the climb, Ciccone and Bisiaux caught and passed De Pestel, pulling out a 20-second gap on the very reduced main group.</p>\n<p>The main group split apart even further as riders started to attack, forcing the likes of Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Isaac del Toro to work hard to try to hold on. Meanwhile, in front, Lorenzo Fortunato and Giulio Pelizzari joined the two leaders, before Del Toro also bridged up to the front of the race over the top of the climb.</p>\n<p>With 20km to go, it was those five riders in front, 20 seconds ahead of the next chasing group, which contained Bernal, and the gap was up to 45 seconds with 5km to go. Fiercely chasing, the group did bring the gap down in the run-in, but not enough to catch the leaders, who battled out the final kilometres amongst themselves.</p>\n<p>Going into the final kilometre, Bisiaux launched early, which initially looked like it could have been too early, but a moment of hesitation in the group saw him jump away, and then solo to the line to take the victory, as his attacking companions had to settle for the minor places behind.</p>\n<p>Pushing on in the final kilometres, Giovanni Aleotti (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Johannes Kulset (Uno-X Mobility), Urko Berrade (Equipo Kern Pharma), and AJ August (Ineos Grenadiers) were the first of the chasers to come home, only 14 seconds behind Ciccone in second, whilst Bernal lost time in the finale.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The men&#8217;s Vuelta a Burgos has been a multi-day stage race as part of the UCI Europe Tour since 2005.</p>\n<p>Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5) pipped Matteo Malucelli (XDS Astana Team) to the line by the barest of margins to win stage 2 of the Vuelta a Burgos in Buniel, his win only confirmed after a photo finish.</p>\n<p>The two Italians came to the line at rapid speed, just in front of Juan Sebasti√°n Molano (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) in a three-up blanket finish from the sprint.</p>\n<p>Moschetti hit the front first in the final charge for the line, with Molano on his left and Malucelli charging up his right very late. Despite the latter&#8217;s high closing speed from the slipstream, the Q36.5 rider just held on to win.</p>\n<p>This was Moschetti&#8217;s 13th professional victory, and fifth in what&#8217;s already been a great 2025 season, often punching above his weight against sprinters on WorldTour teams.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 winner Roger Adri√† finished safely in the front bunch to hold onto his four-second overall lead and the purple jersey.</p>\n<p>His first real defence will come on Thursday&#8217;s stage 3, with a difficult climbing stage en route to Valpuesta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was very close, I didn&#8217;t think I had won before it was officially confirmed with a photo finish. The team worked very hard today, so I want to thank them all for the work they did,&#8221; said Moschetti.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a stage that was very important for us, with a great opportunity at getting the stage victory. We&#8217;ve done a very good job to win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Moschetti said the team&#8217;s focus would now turn to Damien Howson&#8217;s GC ambitions, with the hardest climbing days to come on tomorrow&#8217;s stage 3 and the final day to Lagunas de Neila on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The Vuelta a Burgos resumed for stage 2 from Cilleruelo de Abajo, with 161km and the easiest route of the race on paper on offer to Buniel in Castilla y Le√≥n.</p>\n<p>A four-man breakaway was formed quickly by riders from the lower division Spanish teams: Joan Albert Riera (Illes Balears Arabay), Iker Mintegi, Txomin Juaristi (Euskaltel &#8211; Euskadi), Ander Okamika (Burgos Burpellet BH), and they led the race until the final 10km.</p>\n<p>They were pulled back gradually after three and a half hours by the peloton, led by UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Q36.5, with a likely reduced-sprint finish incoming.</p>\n<p>Several teams swapped on the front in the charge for the line, but no one could establish a full lead-out train to pilot their sprinter. At times, Tudor and Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale took over on the front, but it was the teams who&#8217;d been working all day that came to the fore in the end ‚Äì Q36.5 and UAE.</p>\n<p>Moschetti hit the front for the Swiss team after one of his teammates and XDS Astana&#8217;s Gleb Syritsa had finished their turns, sprinting early in the wind but with a good kick. UAE&#8217;s Molano wasn&#8217;t far behind and tried to come out of the Italian&#8217;s wheel.</p>\n<p>He lacked enough speed to overtake Moschetti, however, though there was another challenger coming up his other side and down the middle of the road ‚Äì compatriot Malucelli.</p>\n<p>Despite it coming down to a photo finish, Moschetti was confirmed as the stage winner, pipping his fellow Italian by a tyre&#8217;s width.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The men&#8217;s Vuelta a Burgos has been a multi-day stage race as part of the UCI Europe Tour since 2005.</p>\n<p>Roger Adri√† (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) won stage 1 of the Vuelta a Burgos, storming to victory atop the Alto del Castillo after a back-and-forth sprint against Jordan Labrosse (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>The Spanish rider opened up the final run to the line inside 400 metres to go, but was passed by the Decathlon rider and looked momentarily defeated, until finding a second wind and out-sprinting the French rider to his third professional victory.</p>\n<p>Pre-stage favourite Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was well-placed to contest the sprint for the first purple jersey, but misjudged a corner while following the pair in front and crashed, also taking out Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n winner Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) in the process.</p>\n<p>Afonso Eul√°lio (Bahrain Victorious) finished third at the castle in Burgos, four seconds down on Adri√†, with Labrosse&#8217;s teammate L√©o Bisiaux close behind to take fourth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The team looked after me very well, and I was able to save my legs for this final climb. I entered well and decided to push hard in the last 400 meters, which I already knew,&#8221; said Adri√†.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy to win in Spain and in the Vuelta a Burgos, which is very beautiful and important in our country. Last year, I finished second in a stage, so I got that sting out of the way. Great riders always come here, and it&#8217;s difficult to win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Adri√† looked ahead to the hardest climbing days on stages 3 and 5, with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe&#8217;s roster also featuring Jai Hindley and Giulio Pellizzari, who should be strong up the Puerto de Ordu√±a and Lagnuas de Neila ascents.</p>\n<p>The 42nd Vuelta a Burgos opened from Olmillos de Sasam√≥n, with undulating terrain in Castilla y Le√≥n offering up a punchy finale to the castle in Burgos city after 204km of racing.</p>\n<p>A breakaway formed 175km from the finish, with six riders getting up the road: Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Carlos Garc√≠a Pierna (Burgos Burpellet BH), Javier Ib√°√±ez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Mikel Bizkarra (Euskaltel Euskadi), Joan Gamundi and Asier Pablo Gonzalez (both Illes Balears Arabay).</p>\n<p>They survived until the race reached the hardest climb of the stage, the category 1 Alto de la Mazorra (7km at 5.2%), where De Bondt and Garc√≠a Pierna emerged as the strongest. With 20km to go, the duo were still in front, but their lead was just 40 seconds, as the big teams ramped up the pace approaching the finale.</p>\n<p>Finally the catch was made after the penultimate cateorised climb, with several attacks being launched soon after, but the best came from Samuel Fern√°ndez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), who made his move stick with 7km to go.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek and Q36.5 chased hard to bring Fern√°ndez back before the foot of the Alto del Castillo in Burgos, with the final kilometre averaging 6% gradient. The solo escapee was caught halfway up the ascent and the final sprint for victory began.</p>\n<p>Adri√° hit out early for glory as the wide narrowed up to the castle in Burgos, finding a second effort to beat Labrosse to the line. The big news away from the win, though, was Del Toro and Ciccone crashing in one of the final bends, with both of their team&#8217;s needing to asses their injuries, and both pre-race favourites certain to lose time.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=192&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It consists of seven or eight stages and is usually around 1,200 km in length. The race was first held in 1928 and is considered the oldest and most important bicycle race in Poland.</p>\n<p>Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) lived up to the billing and won stage 1 of the Tour de Pologne in Legnica, taking victory after surviving a hectic run into the final sprint that saw a crash inside the last 2km.</p>\n<p>The Dutch sprinter hit the front late 200 metres from the line with a perfectly-timed surge after the final bend, winning by a wheel from Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep). Jensen Plowright (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was third.</p>\n<p>Visma controlled for much of the 200km stage that started in Wroc≈Çaw, but did not organise their lead-out well, with Kooij having to freelance his way to the front as riders clashed shoulders and some even had to unclip amid the chaos of a scary sprint in the final 5km.</p>\n<p>A crash 1.8km from the line occured after several narrowings of a largely wide road leading into the city, and meant several lead-out trains were affected. This was, however, the only likely pure bunch sprint on the 2025 route.</p>\n<p>After his sixth win of the season and fourth at WorldTour-level, Kooij takes the race leader&#8217;s jersey into stage 2, which offers up a hilly route starting and finishing in Karpacz.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was definitely not easy, but somehow we managed to pull off a victory almost every time we come here, so that&#8217;s good memories,&#8221; said Kooij, after his fifth Tour de Pologne stage win, before giving big credit to his team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was pretty amazing and a really strong job by the team to control all day, and also to bring us in the final like this, we maybe lost each other a bit ‚Äì the three of us in the final, but we managed to still do an amazing job.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was a rainy opening to the 82nd Tour de Pologne, with men&#8217;s WorldTour action returning, eight days after the conclusion of the Tour de France. Wroc≈Çaw hosted the start of the 200km stage to Legnica, with a breakaway quickly forming.</p>\n<p>Four men got up the road: Lars Boven (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Donavan Grondin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Patryk Stosz (Poland) and Nadav Raisberg (Israel-Premier Tech), but the latter quickly returned to the peloton as the teams with sprinters kept the gap below two minutes.</p>\n<p>There was a crash in the peloton for around 12 riders on the wet roads with 160km to go in the stage through a bend, including several from Israel-Premier Tech and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, but everyone was soon back on their bikes.</p>\n<p>Boven and Grondin were the last men standing, but 38km from the finish, they were reeled back in under the control of Visma-Lease a Bike and Soudal-QuickStep, with the final fight for position beginning to unfold.</p>\n<p>Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek) sprinted to the maximum KOM points on offer on stage 1, cresting the only categorised climb on an otherwise completely flat route in Prochowice in first, which put some life into the now-complete peloton.</p>\n<p>The wide roads narrowed multiple times on the run into Legnica, which meant for a hectic peloton and eventually a crash with 1.8km to go, with many riders going down near the front. Most of the fast men did survive the chaos, though, so there was still going to be a big sprint.</p>\n<p>Tim Torn Teutenberg (Lidl-Trek) opened up the sprint early with a burst 320 metres from the finish, but he soon faded and got passed by the charging bunch.</p>\n<p>Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) and Max Kanter (XDS Astana) were well-positioned, but the pure sprinters were coming quickly, with Kooij charging to the front to take an expected victory on the opener.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

When it&#8217;s hard for everyone and they&#8217;re on their limit, it suits me, so then I could win the stage,&#8221; Vacek explained.</p>\n<p>The 163.3km stage from Welkenraedt to Seraing was like a mini-Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge and included the Col du Rosier, the C√¥te de la Redoute and the C√¥te de la Roche-aux-Faucons.</p>\n<p>Vlad Van Mechelen (Bahrain Victorious) and Tom Donnenwirth (Groupama-FDJ) formed the early break the stage and opened a significant gap, often in pouring rain but they were carefully chased down by Lidl-Trek and the peloton.</p>\n<p>Van Mechelen stayed clear alone as the hills hurt and on the Roche-aux-Faucons Toon Aerts and Lars Craps (both Lotto) with Vacek Brandon Rivera (Ineos Grenadiers) counter-attacked. They were pulled back as Corbin and Vacek fought for the late intermediate sprint bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Strong took two seconds, virtually overtaking general classification leader Oliver Knight (Cofidis) but Vacek was also a threat.</p>\n<p>When Van Mechelen was caught 20 kilometres from the finish, there was another bonus sprint battle. Vacek took three seconds, while hurting his rivals in the peloton.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek rode hard to set-up Vacek on the final climb and his attack dragged a small group clear.</p>\n<p>Only Strong, Tesfatsion and Canal could go with him and they then descended towards Seraing.</p>\n<p>Vacek led out and won the sprint to move him to just one second down on Strong in the GC before Wednesday&#8217;s final stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tomorrow is another hard stage. I hope to recover well and we go for it again&#8221; Vacek said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll race hard, enjoy it and if we get a GC win, it&#8217;s perfect. if not Im still happy with my performance and the team. We go all in for it tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=193&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=193&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) lit up the final stage of the 2025 Tour de France to cap off a near-perfect race and claim his fourth overall title. With four stage wins and another yellow jersey, the world champion moved equal with Chris Froome on four Tour wins, only behind the four all-time greats who have five titles in the all-time list.</p>\n<p>The yellow jersey finished fourth on a thrilling final stage 21 to the Champs-√âlys√©es in the rain, getting dropped by Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) 6.4km from the finish after attacking several times, as the Belgian rode solo to a memorable victory. He celebrated over the line 19 seconds later after missing out on one final mic drop.</p>\n<p>Despite the race organiser ASO&#8217;s hopes of more GC action unfolding on the final day, pouring rain in Paris meant that times for the overall had to be taken after four passages of the finish line on the Champs-√âlys√©es due to safety concerns. The final 50.3km and all three laps up to Montmartre were taken on with no effect on the general classification, but with serious action.</p>\n<p>With the risk reduced, the modified finale in Paris and the inclusion of the climb to Montmartre on stage 21 did, however, bring Pogaƒçar into play in the final attacking 50km, with the yellow jersey animating what was an exhilarating finale to a brutally difficult edition of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar showed his intentions on the first rep up the ascent towards the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica, chasing down a move from Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) and ensuring he was in the front group that led through the fifth passage of the finish.</p>\n<p>Over the second, he kicked on to create a leading group of six over the top, which would play out the final lap and fight for the stage honours: Matteo Jorgenson, Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Davide Ballerini (XDS Astana), Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain Victorious) and Matteo Trentin (Tudor).</p>\n<p>But on the third, his final seated attack on the cobbled 1.1km ascent was matched by one man ‚Äì Van Aert ‚Äì who landed a killer counterpunch 350 metres from the crest of the climb to scorch away to the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, it was a nice race, great from the organisers to neutralise the GC times so nobody had to risk anything, and it was quite fair play in the end,&#8221; said overall winner Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I gave it a go because I was in the front, but Wout was incredibly strong today. He did an amazing attack on the top of the climb, and he deserved this big, big win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, I&#8217;m super happy that it&#8217;s over, but I must say that I really enjoyed the whole Tour. For sure, I will maybe already miss it next week, but it was a pleasure to be here, wear this yellow jersey, ride with my teammates, and ride against all the opponents. It was a great, great Tour.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finally, Van Aert, after a Tour well away from his best, one of the modern greats of Tour de France stage hunting, fought his way to a second victory on &#8216;the world&#8217;s most beautiful boulevard&#8217; for his 10th career Tour stage win, and one of the absolute best of his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I agree, it was a special day out, and a really special one to win here on the Champs-√âlys√©es once again, of course, on the first occasion where we also climbed the Montmartre,&#8221; said Van Aert</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rain made it quite sketchy, but I managed to stay upright and had full support from my teammate. I really have to thank them for keeping believing in me and for trying over and over again, even today, they were still there to support me, so without them, I couldn&#8217;t control this race and go to the last climb, leave it all out there, which was the plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I also wanted the 20 stages before today, but I came close a few times, but also was quite far off on several occasions. Even yesterday, I didn&#8217;t feel good enough to make the breakaway, so the hardest thing for me was to keep the belief, but because the people around me kept believing, I was able to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to say we came to this tour with the ambition to win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and the biggest cyclist in the world won it. Tadej Pogaƒçar was the strongest, we tried to give him competition, and I&#8217;m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day, but for sure, we don&#8217;t go home without prizes. We should be proud.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWhile the finale on stage 21 on the Tour de France was set to be different due to the inclusion of the Montmartre climb, the final day to Paris started in its typical fashion, with the team of the winner Tadej Pogaƒçar ‚Äì UAE Team Emirates-XRG ‚Äì starting things off the front.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and his teammates led everyone away, with the world champion aboard a yellow Colnago Y1RS frame for the big day, and his teammates all having yellow details added to their kits and equipment.</p>\n<p>All of the Tour&#8217;s Australians brought up the rear for a picture together, while the Italian&#8217;s did similarly towards the front, and it was the true calm before the storm before the race finally reached Paris after what had been a brutal edition.</p>\n<p>After just about every team and nation had taken the photograph they wanted to celebrate reaching the Tour&#8217;s finale, UAE started pacing on the front to bring the race east, towards Paris.</p>\n<p>With 75km to go, and an hour and a half of casual racing into France&#8217;s capital city, the riders met the cobbles and had a first look at the circuit in Paris, which would take them into Montmartre and all the way to the Champs-√âlys√©es finish.</p>\n<p>The first attacks came with 69.5km to go, with Alexis Renard (Cofidis) and Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) among the early accelerators on the first lap of the Champs-√âlys√©es.</p>\n<p>Sights like the Mus√©e de Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe were passed as the flyover from La Patrouille de France brought the tricolore to life above the &#8216;world&#8217;s most beautiful avenue&#8217;, but the riders had no chance to sneak a look with the action kicking off fully.</p>\n<p>A mid-stage announcement did mean that, due to the rainy weather, the GC times would be taken after the completion of the fourth lap in Paris, meaning all three laps of the climb to Montmartre and the final 50.3km would be raced without any implications on the overall.</p>\n<p>Attacks continued to be launched prior to Montmartre&#8217;s introduction, with even podium-sitter Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) going off the front in a move with Simmons. Others suffered behind with punctures, as the rough cobbled roads took their toll.</p>\n<p>As the raging peloton approached the first ascent of the 1.1km climb, which averages 5.9%, Lipowitz and Simmons were brought back by an Alpecin-Deceuninck-led peloton. Onto new roads, and Tudor took over to set an infernal pace ahead of the climb&#8217;s beginning.</p>\n<p>The raging crowds were in their thousands on the narrow roads of the climb, with sport&#8217;s best-ever arena showing itself once again at the Tour de France as they passed the Moulin Rouge and entered the cobbled ascent.</p>\n<p>Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) exploded into life on the climb, to the delight of the fans, with Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) following him and even race leader Pogaƒçar deciding to follow with 40km remaining on the final day.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar chased across with Wout van Aert, showing clear intentions that he wanted to play a part in the final. Past the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica and onto the descent back to the circuit, and only a select few had made it into the leading group.</p>\n<p>Things came back together to form a group of around 25 riders in front as they approached the fifth passage of the finish, but the grey clouds had returned, and the heavens opened, with rain pouring onto the cobbles with two full laps remaining.</p>\n<p>A group of 28 led into the second ascent of the Montmartre climb: Pogaƒçar, Alaphilippe, Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Wout van Aert, Victory Campenaerts, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Matej Mohoriƒç, Fred Wright (Bahrain-Victorious), Axel Laurance (Ineos Grenadiers), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves (Alpecin Decueninck), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Alex Aranburu, Dylan Teuns (Cofidis), Bastien Tronchon, Aurelien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Davide Ballerni, Cl√©ment Champoussin, Mike Teunissen (XDS Astana), Pavel Bittner, Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL), De Lie, Jenno Berckmoes (Lotto) and Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Campenarts led out Jorgenson on the front, with Pogaƒçar moving up and looking ominous. Van Aert had to move up to get to his teammates, but before he could get there, the yellow jersey accelerated, with only the strongest riders following him.</p>\n<p>Over the top, Ballerini, Jorgenson, Van Aert and Trentin were the only survivors from Pogaƒçar&#8217;s seated push, with 22km remaining on the wet cobbles. Mohoriƒç soon joined them to make it six in front, which is no surprise given his expertise going downhill.</p>\n<p>The speeds were still rapid as the six men in front descended away from the north of the city towards the finish line, where they would be taking the bell after almost three hours of racing. A chase group only went backwards, with the six in front taking a 40-second advantage into the foot of the final ascent.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson launched the first bid for glory in the finale as Visma tried to use their numbers to their advantage, but Mohoriƒç marked it quickly 10km from the finish, with the climb and descent to the Champs-√âlys√©es going to decide things.</p>\n<p>The American tried again as Van Aert let his wheel go 1.5 kilometres before the foot of the final climb, but again Mohoriƒç and Pogaƒçar were on it to chase things down. A third move was marked by Trentin, and they eventually reached the climb as a six.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar led things with Van Aert on his wheel, exploding into life past the cheers, but his seated drive was not yet dropping his rivals. Mohoriƒç was the first victim, then Trentin and Jorgenson, and we were down to three as Van Aert countered.</p>\n<p>The Belgian launched 300 metres from the crest and put Pogaƒçar on a gap with a huge counter punch. The crowds were overjoyed, but the race was not over, with 6.2km still to race on stage 21.</p>\n<p>Six seconds was all he had over the crest, with a wet, slippery downhill run separating him from a second win on the Champs-√âlys√©es. But it soon became apparent that it was going to become the fairytale ending for Van Aert.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s charge ended, and he fell back to the other chasers, crossing the line fourth with a raised arm in celebration over the line. He had a lot of duties still to complete from the podium to the winner&#8217;s press conference, but he shared a moment with his partner and women&#8217;s pro Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart past the finish, ahead of his fourth trip to the top step of the Tour&#8217;s overall podium.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) lit up the final stage of the 2025 Tour de France to cap off a near-perfect race and claim his fourth overall title. With four stage wins and another yellow jersey, the world champion moved equal with Chris Froome on four Tour wins, only behind the four all-time greats who have five titles in the all-time list.</p>\n<p>The yellow jersey finished fourth on a thrilling final stage 21 to the Champs-√âlys√©es in the rain, getting dropped by Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) 6.4km from the finish after attacking several times, as the Belgian rode solo to a memorable victory. He celebrated over the line 19 seconds later after missing out on one final mic drop.</p>\n<p>Despite the race organiser ASO&#8217;s hopes of more GC action unfolding on the final day, pouring rain in Paris meant that times for the overall had to be taken after four passages of the finish line on the Champs-√âlys√©es due to safety concerns. The final 50.3km and all three laps up to Montmartre were taken on with no effect on the general classification, but with serious action.</p>\n<p>With the risk reduced, the modified finale in Paris and the inclusion of the climb to Montmartre on stage 21 did, however, bring Pogaƒçar into play in the final attacking 50km, with the yellow jersey animating what was an exhilarating finale to a brutally difficult edition of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar showed his intentions on the first rep up the ascent towards the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica, chasing down a move from Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) and ensuring he was in the front group that led through the fifth passage of the finish.</p>\n<p>Over the second, he kicked on to create a leading group of six over the top, which would play out the final lap and fight for the stage honours: Matteo Jorgenson, Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Davide Ballerini (XDS Astana), Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain Victorious) and Matteo Trentin (Tudor).</p>\n<p>But on the third, his final seated attack on the cobbled 1.1km ascent was matched by one man ‚Äì Van Aert ‚Äì who landed a killer counterpunch 350 metres from the crest of the climb to scorch away to the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, it was a nice race, great from the organisers to neutralise the GC times so nobody had to risk anything, and it was quite fair play in the end,&#8221; said overall winner Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I gave it a go because I was in the front, but Wout was incredibly strong today. He did an amazing attack on the top of the climb, and he deserved this big, big win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, I&#8217;m super happy that it&#8217;s over, but I must say that I really enjoyed the whole Tour. For sure, I will maybe already miss it next week, but it was a pleasure to be here, wear this yellow jersey, ride with my teammates, and ride against all the opponents. It was a great, great Tour.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Finally, Van Aert, after a Tour well away from his best, one of the modern greats of Tour de France stage hunting, fought his way to a second victory on &#8216;the world&#8217;s most beautiful boulevard&#8217; for his 10th career Tour stage win, and one of the absolute best of his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I agree, it was a special day out, and a really special one to win here on the Champs-√âlys√©es once again, of course, on the first occasion where we also climbed the Montmartre,&#8221; said Van Aert</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rain made it quite sketchy, but I managed to stay upright and had full support from my teammate. I really have to thank them for keeping believing in me and for trying over and over again, even today, they were still there to support me, so without them, I couldn&#8217;t control this race and go to the last climb, leave it all out there, which was the plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I also wanted the 20 stages before today, but I came close a few times, but also was quite far off on several occasions. Even yesterday, I didn&#8217;t feel good enough to make the breakaway, so the hardest thing for me was to keep the belief, but because the people around me kept believing, I was able to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to say we came to this tour with the ambition to win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and the biggest cyclist in the world won it. Tadej Pogaƒçar was the strongest, we tried to give him competition, and I&#8217;m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day, but for sure, we don&#8217;t go home without prizes. We should be proud.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWhile the finale on stage 21 on the Tour de France was set to be different due to the inclusion of the Montmartre climb, the final day to Paris started in its typical fashion, with the team of the winner Tadej Pogaƒçar ‚Äì UAE Team Emirates-XRG ‚Äì starting things off the front.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and his teammates led everyone away, with the world champion aboard a yellow Colnago Y1RS frame for the big day, and his teammates all having yellow details added to their kits and equipment.</p>\n<p>All of the Tour&#8217;s Australians brought up the rear for a picture together, while the Italian&#8217;s did similarly towards the front, and it was the true calm before the storm before the race finally reached Paris after what had been a brutal edition.</p>\n<p>After just about every team and nation had taken the photograph they wanted to celebrate reaching the Tour&#8217;s finale, UAE started pacing on the front to bring the race east, towards Paris.</p>\n<p>With 75km to go, and an hour and a half of casual racing into France&#8217;s capital city, the riders met the cobbles and had a first look at the circuit in Paris, which would take them into Montmartre and all the way to the Champs-√âlys√©es finish.</p>\n<p>The first attacks came with 69.5km to go, with Alexis Renard (Cofidis) and Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) among the early accelerators on the first lap of the Champs-√âlys√©es.</p>\n<p>Sights like the Mus√©e de Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe were passed as the flyover from La Patrouille de France brought the tricolore to life above the &#8216;world&#8217;s most beautiful avenue&#8217;, but the riders had no chance to sneak a look with the action kicking off fully.</p>\n<p>A mid-stage announcement did mean that, due to the rainy weather, the GC times would be taken after the completion of the fourth lap in Paris, meaning all three laps of the climb to Montmartre and the final 50.3km would be raced without any implications on the overall.</p>\n<p>Attacks continued to be launched prior to Montmartre&#8217;s introduction, with even podium-sitter Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) going off the front in a move with Simmons. Others suffered behind with punctures, as the rough cobbled roads took their toll.</p>\n<p>As the raging peloton approached the first ascent of the 1.1km climb, which averages 5.9%, Lipowitz and Simmons were brought back by an Alpecin-Deceuninck-led peloton. Onto new roads, and Tudor took over to set an infernal pace ahead of the climb&#8217;s beginning.</p>\n<p>The raging crowds were in their thousands on the narrow roads of the climb, with sport&#8217;s best-ever arena showing itself once again at the Tour de France as they passed the Moulin Rouge and entered the cobbled ascent.</p>\n<p>Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) exploded into life on the climb, to the delight of the fans, with Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) following him and even race leader Pogaƒçar deciding to follow with 40km remaining on the final day.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar chased across with Wout van Aert, showing clear intentions that he wanted to play a part in the final. Past the Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica and onto the descent back to the circuit, and only a select few had made it into the leading group.</p>\n<p>Things came back together to form a group of around 25 riders in front as they approached the fifth passage of the finish, but the grey clouds had returned, and the heavens opened, with rain pouring onto the cobbles with two full laps remaining.</p>\n<p>A group of 28 led into the second ascent of the Montmartre climb: Pogaƒçar, Alaphilippe, Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Wout van Aert, Victory Campenaerts, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Matej Mohoriƒç, Fred Wright (Bahrain-Victorious), Axel Laurance (Ineos Grenadiers), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves (Alpecin Decueninck), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Alex Aranburu, Dylan Teuns (Cofidis), Bastien Tronchon, Aurelien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Davide Ballerni, Cl√©ment Champoussin, Mike Teunissen (XDS Astana), Pavel Bittner, Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL), De Lie, Jenno Berckmoes (Lotto) and Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Campenarts led out Jorgenson on the front, with Pogaƒçar moving up and looking ominous. Van Aert had to move up to get to his teammates, but before he could get there, the yellow jersey accelerated, with only the strongest riders following him.</p>\n<p>Over the top, Ballerini, Jorgenson, Van Aert and Trentin were the only survivors from Pogaƒçar&#8217;s seated push, with 22km remaining on the wet cobbles. Mohoriƒç soon joined them to make it six in front, which is no surprise given his expertise going downhill.</p>\n<p>The speeds were still rapid as the six men in front descended away from the north of the city towards the finish line, where they would be taking the bell after almost three hours of racing. A chase group only went backwards, with the six in front taking a 40-second advantage into the foot of the final ascent.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson launched the first bid for glory in the finale as Visma tried to use their numbers to their advantage, but Mohoriƒç marked it quickly 10km from the finish, with the climb and descent to the Champs-√âlys√©es going to decide things.</p>\n<p>The American tried again as Van Aert let his wheel go 1.5 kilometres before the foot of the final climb, but again Mohoriƒç and Pogaƒçar were on it to chase things down. A third move was marked by Trentin, and they eventually reached the climb as a six.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar led things with Van Aert on his wheel, exploding into life past the cheers, but his seated drive was not yet dropping his rivals. Mohoriƒç was the first victim, then Trentin and Jorgenson, and we were down to three as Van Aert countered.</p>\n<p>The Belgian launched 300 metres from the crest and put Pogaƒçar on a gap with a huge counter punch. The crowds were overjoyed, but the race was not over, with 6.2km still to race on stage 21.</p>\n<p>Six seconds was all he had over the crest, with a wet, slippery downhill run separating him from a second win on the Champs-√âlys√©es. But it soon became apparent that it was going to become the fairytale ending for Van Aert.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s charge ended, and he fell back to the other chasers, crossing the line fourth with a raised arm in celebration over the line. He had a lot of duties still to complete from the podium to the winner&#8217;s press conference, but he shared a moment with his partner and women&#8217;s pro Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart past the finish, ahead of his fourth trip to the top step of the Tour&#8217;s overall podium.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But when the rain starts to fall, I always have a super feeling normally in the cold weather, and it&#8217;s like my first-ever time winning solo, and it&#8217;s a Tour stage, so it&#8217;s pretty incredible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really a childhood dream because I only started cycling quite late, but there&#8217;s so much pressure at the Tour, and having won at the Giro and the Vuelta, all I ever get asked is &#8216;Am I good enough to win at the Tour?&#8217;, and now I have shown them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Race leader Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and most of the GC favourites arrived home safely in the peloton more than six minutes after Groves took victory, all but confirming his victory in the 2025 Tour ‚Äì barring any disaster on the final stage in Paris.</p>\n<p>Unlike in previous Tours, completing stage 20 doesn&#8217;t confirm the result; however, with the modified stage in Paris honouring the Olympics by containing three laps up the climb to Montmartre on what was the traditional procession stage.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar will need to survive the chaos of Paris to confirm his fourth yellow jersey triumph, but it&#8217;s yet to be seen how the peloton takes on stage 21, with lots of riders being unhappy at the additions.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the Alps in the rear-view mirror, the 160 remaining riders at the start of stage 20 on the Tour de France may have been praying for some respite, with one stage separating them from the finale in Paris. But that was never going to happen with the route on offer.</p>\n<p>With 184.2km and a completely up-and-down route on offer on the road from Nantua to Pontarlier, it was ‚Äì as the penultimate stage of the Tour often is ‚Äì always going to be a day for the break.</p>\n<p>As expected, a breathless fight to make it into the front group ensued in the opening hour, with Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost) opening things up from the flag drop, only to be caught on the first categorised climb, the Col de la Croix de la Serra (12.2km at 4.1%).</p>\n<p>Riders had already begun to struggle as the pace was kept rapid in the front, with practically every team interested in being represented in the second-to-last chance to win a stage. Even GC hopefuls in the top 10 tried their luck, notably Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), but everyone was on high alert.</p>\n<p>Stage 15 winner Tim Wellens began to show he had freedom for another day, lighting up the long climb with several attacks, but it was Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) who led the race over its crest, before a tough descent in the rain split things further.</p>\n<p>The absolute anarchy continued on the second climb, C√¥te de Valfin, which is where a lead trio established itself, with Wellens being joined off the front by Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Ewen Costiou (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels).</p>\n<p>With 135km to go, the three leaders had just 15 seconds on the still raging peloton, with Spanish champion Iv√°n Romeo leading a chase group on the attack. Soon, the 10 riders joined those in front to form a leading break of 13, finally.</p>\n<p>After a breathless 65km of racing, making it in were Wellens, Costiou, Jorgenson, Romeo, Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep), Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost), Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Simone Velasco (XDS-Astana), Jordan Jegat (Total Energies), Frank van den Broek (Picnic-PostNL) and Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Others tried to bridge across, but made no progress, and a break was finally set. The UAE and Visma riders came to the front, signalling the end, for now, of all the vicious attacking, allowing a near two-minute lead to establish itself.</p>\n<p>Jegat&#8217;s presence, however, meant that Jayco AlUla soon took over to pace, to protect Ben O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s 10th place on GC, with Swiss champion Mauro Schmid ‚Äì even despite crashing hard on a descent ‚Äì leading things on the front.</p>\n<p>Riders in the front group were annoyed at Jegat&#8217;s presence, but they got their wish on the third categorised climb of he race, albeit in the wrong direction, as he went off on his own with an attack up the C√¥te de Th√©sy.</p>\n<p>He was alone briefly, but he was countered and left behind by a rampant Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost), who attacked solo with 55km remaining on the day. His gap reduced briefly, but the Australian pushed on and 15 kilometres later, he had a lead of 50 seconds over the 12 chasers from the original move.</p>\n<p>The peloton slowed as a counter move of 16 was led out by Wout van Aert on the climb in an attempt to bridge across to the front, but with 40km to go, they were still four minutes behind, with the peloton 5:24 away from the lone Sweeny.</p>\n<p>Rain began to fall again as they approached the final phase of another brutal stage, but O&#8217;Connor had to start helping Schmid pace for himself, to protect what was a 4:08 lead on Jegat at the start of the stage.</p>\n<p>New attacks came from the chasing remnants of the break, with Jorgenson and Wellens being left behind by a group of Gr√©goire, Eenkhoorn, Groves, Van den Broek and Stewart, and a second chase group of Trentin, Romeo, Velasco and Jegat in the gap between them.</p>\n<p>This did for Sweeny&#8217;s lead, and he was swept up by the now joined-up chase groups on the lower slopes of the final categorised climb ‚Äì C√¥te de Longeville ‚Äì where Groves made the first attack after a big slip of his back wheel.</p>\n<p>Romeo tried to attack away, but local lad Gr√©goire soon had him back before the crest, and now there were six leading the race in the final 24km: Groves, Van den Broek, Velasco, Gr√©goire, Stewart, and the Spanish champion.</p>\n<p>Disaster struck not long after, as Romeo crashed while leading through a wet corner 21km from the finish, with Gr√©goire hitting the deck but bouncing back quickly, and Velasco and Groves almost missing the corner completely.</p>\n<p>The Australian sprinter just made it around just to form a new lead trio with Stewart and Van den Broek, with Eenkhoorn chasing on and Jorgenson and Wellens trying to find their way back to the front just 27 seconds down the road.</p>\n<p>With Van den Broek not working in the front, Groves had enough and set off on his own in the final 17 kilometres, leaving Stewart and the young Dutchman to bicker behind him, with the chasing groups behind reforming slowly after the crash.</p>\n<p>The Australian powered on in the wet conditions as those in the chase faltered behind him, confirming that he would complete the Grand Tour stage win set with a solo triumph on stage 20 of the Tour. Van den Broek and Eenkhoorn led the chase home for the minor places.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and the peloton arrived safely, avoiding a bizarre late crash in the peloton for the likes of Damien Touz√© (Cofidis), with the only loser on GC on the penultimate day being O&#8217;Connor, who ran out of steam in the chase and lost his 10th spot overall to Jegat in the break by two minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

His gap reduced briefly, but the Australian pushed on and 15 kilometres later, he had a lead of 50 seconds over the 12 chasers from the original move.</p>\n<p>The peloton slowed as a counter move of 16 was led out by Wout van Aert on the climb in an attempt to bridge across to the front, but with 40km to go, they were still four minutes behind, with the peloton 5:24 away from the lone Sweeny.</p>\n<p>Rain began to fall again as they approached the final phase of another brutal stage, but O&#8217;Connor had to start helping Schmid pace for himself, to protect what was a 4:08 lead on Jegat at the start of the stage.</p>\n<p>New attacks came from the chasing remnants of the break, with Jorgenson and Wellens being left behind by a group of Gr√©goire, Eenkhoorn, Groves, Van den Broek and Stewart, and a second chase group of Trentin, Romeo, Velasco and Jegat in the gap between them.</p>\n<p>This did for Sweeny&#8217;s lead, and he was swept up by the now joined-up chase groups on the lower slopes of the final categorised climb ‚Äì C√¥te de Longeville ‚Äì where Groves made the first attack after a big slip of his back wheel.</p>\n<p>Romeo tried to attack away, but local lad Gr√©goire soon had him back before the crest, and now there were six leading the race in the final 24km: Groves, Van den Broek, Velasco, Gr√©goire, Stewart, and the Spanish champion.</p>\n<p>Disaster struck not long after, as Romeo crashed while leading through a wet corner 21km from the finish, with Gr√©goire hitting the deck but bouncing back quickly, and Velasco and Groves almost missing the corner completely.</p>\n<p>The Australian sprinter just made it around just to form a new lead trio with Stewart and Van den Broek, with Eenkhoorn chasing on and Jorgenson and Wellens trying to find their way back to the front just 27 seconds down the road.</p>\n<p>With Van den Broek not working in the front, Groves had enough and set off on his own in the final 17 kilometres, leaving Stewart and the young Dutchman to bicker behind him, with the chasing groups behind reforming slowly after the crash.</p>\n<p>The Australian powered on in the wet conditions as those in the chase faltered behind him, confirming that he would complete the Grand Tour stage win set with a solo triumph on stage 20 of the Tour.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) claimed a stunning solo victory on stage 20 of the Tour de France, attacking away after a breathless fight from a 13-man breakaway 17km from the finish line in Pontarlier.</p>\n<p>It looked like a six-man group was set to fight things out in the final 20km, but Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar) and Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) crashed hard in a wet corner, and the Australian and two others got ahead, having just navigated their way through the treacherous conditions.</p>\n<p>Groves was left alongside Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech) and Frank van den Broek (Picnic PostNL) in the lead before he went solo just under 17km from the finish, with the Brit and Dutchman left bickering at the lack of cooperation, which is what prompted the Australian to jump.</p>\n<p>His gap grew as he approached the finish, with the groups behind joining up, but barely making any impression on Groves&#8217; lead. With some encouragement from the team car by team co-owner Kristoff Roodhooft, Groves celebrated emotionally in disbelief.</p>\n<p>Van den Broek finished second for Picnic PostNL, almost a minute down, with Pascal Eenkhoorn taking third after a brutal breakaway battle.</p>\n<p>Completing the set of Grand Tour stage wins with a career 10th, Groves added to his two Giro d&#8217;Italia and seven Vuelta a Espa√±a triumphs with a win on debut at the Tour de France, bringing Alpecin their third win of the 2025 race, 18 stages after their last.</p>\n<p>It bookended a great Tour for the Belgian squad after what was a perfect opening weekend with stage wins by Jasper Philipsen and Mathieu van der Poel.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are so many emotions to win here, the team came here with so many different plans with Jasper and Mathieu, and in the end, I get my own opportunities,&#8221; said a teary-eyed Groves post-stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t gone the right way, but today I had super legs and I just suffered to the line and it rewarded me with a Tour stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The team gave me the free role in the last days, especially today we weren&#8217;t sure whether to go for the stage or save for tomorrow. But when the rain starts to fall, I always have a super feeling normally in the cold weather, and it&#8217;s like my first-ever time winning solo, and it&#8217;s a Tour stage, so it&#8217;s pretty incredible.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really a childhood dream because I only started cycling quite late, but there&#8217;s so much pressure at the Tour, and having won at the Giro and the Vuelta, all I ever get asked is &#8216;Am I good enough to win at the Tour?&#8217;, and now I have shown them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Race leader Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and most of the GC favourites arrived home safely in the peloton more than six minutes after Groves took victory, all but confirming his victory in the 2025 Tour ‚Äì barring any disaster on the final stage in Paris.</p>\n<p>Unlike in previous Tours, completing stage 20 doesn&#8217;t confirm the result; however, with the modified stage in Paris honouring the Olympics by containing three laps up the climb to Montmartre on what was the traditional procession stage.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar will need to survive the chaos of Paris to confirm his fourth yellow jersey triumph, but it&#8217;s yet to be seen how the peloton takes on stage 21, with lots of riders being unhappy at the additions.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the Alps in the rear-view mirror, the 160 remaining riders at the start of stage 20 on the Tour de France may have been praying for some respite, with one stage separating them from the finale in Paris. But that was never going to happen with the route on offer.</p>\n<p>With 184.2km and a completely up-and-down route on offer on the road from Nantua to Pontarlier, it was ‚Äì as the penultimate stage of the Tour often is ‚Äì always going to be a day for the break.</p>\n<p>As expected, a breathless fight to make it into the front group ensued in the opening hour, with Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost) opening things up from the flag drop, only to be caught on the first categorised climb, the Col de la Croix de la Serra (12.2km at 4.1%).</p>\n<p>Riders had already begun to struggle as the pace was kept rapid in the front, with practically every team interested in being represented in the second-to-last chance to win a stage. Even GC hopefuls in the top 10 tried their luck, notably Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), but everyone was on high alert.</p>\n<p>Stage 15 winner Tim Wellens began to show he had freedom for another day, lighting up the long climb with several attacks, but it was Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) who led the race over its crest, before a tough descent in the rain split things further.</p>\n<p>The absolute anarchy continued on the second climb, C√¥te de Valfin, which is where a lead trio established itself, with Wellens being joined off the front by Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Ewen Costiou (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels).</p>\n<p>With 135km to go, the three leaders had just 15 seconds on the still raging peloton, with Spanish champion Iv√°n Romeo leading a chase group on the attack. Soon, the 10 riders joined those in front to form a leading break of 13, finally.</p>\n<p>After a breathless 65km of racing, making it in were Wellens, Costiou, Jorgenson, Romeo, Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep), Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost), Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ), Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Simone Velasco (XDS-Astana), Jordan Jegat (Total Energies), Frank van den Broek (Picnic-PostNL) and Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Others tried to bridge across, but made no progress, and a break was finally set.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) pulled off an exceptional performance to claim his second solo victory at the Tour de France, this time on a shortened stage 19 atop the La Plagne.</p>\n<p>Exhausted after a massive effort on the 19.4km hors categorie ascent to La Plagne, the Dutch climber collapsed into the roadside barriers after crossing the finish line just two seconds ahead of a chase group battling for the general classification.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m absolutely destroyed. I can&#8217;t believe it. Already to win one stage of the Tour is incredible, from a break, but now from the GC group, and against some of the strongest riders in the world, it feels like I&#8217;m dreaming. I don&#8217;t know what I just did,&#8221; Arensman said.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) won the sprint for second place ahead of yellow jersey Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and fourth-place Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe). Lipowitz&#8217;s efforts solidified his third place in the general classification, as he pulled time away from Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) on the climb.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar maintained his lead in the GC standings at 4:24 ahead of Vingegaard and 11:09 ahead of Lipowitz as the race heads into the penultimate stage 20 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We did a very good job until the last climb, and then some teams, some riders, think they can sprint 19km up the climb. So, the pace was incredibly hard to start, and I was thinking that maybe Jonas [Vingegaard] would want to win the stage, also, but he was just holding onto my wheel,&#8221; Pogaƒçar said at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Arensman went on a good attack, I decided not to follow, set my rhythm that I felt comfortable with, and that was it. I&#8217;m just happy it&#8217;s over and there are two more days to Paris.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arensman was part of a select group that formed during the climb to La Plagne. He was the first to attack with 14km to go, but was initially followed by Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, who then appeared not to commit to the move, and Arensman rode away.</p>\n<p>His gap hovered between 20 and 30 seconds on the rain-soaked ascent, and it wasn&#8217;t until the pace from the select chase group picked up between Lipowitz, Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard that the gap began to drop on the upper slopes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After the descent towards La Plagne, we were talking in the radio, Tobias [Foss] was still there with me, also tomorrow is another opportunity, and I told Tobias and the DS in the radio, &#8216;Today is the last mountain stage and I have no GC to ride for, so today I will try to hang on a few kilometres on the climb, to see how the legs feel.&#8217; I told Tobias to &#8216;swing off and that tomorrow is your day, and I will see what I can do today. &#8216;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started to climb and was quite in control, and I was like, I have no GC, maybe they look at each other.

It&#8217;s what I do best.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Once Rubio was gone, I just didn&#8217;t want to get rolled by the yellow jersey coming at me in those final five kilometres. When I heard it stayed at three minutes still with three kilometres to go, I knew I was safe and it was so good.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Col de la Madeleine</strong><br />\nThe attackers gained an extra 30 seconds on the technical descent of the Glandon while Jorgenson and Arensman went off the front as the 19.2km Col de la Madeleine neared and the riders reached the 85km mid-point of the stage.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson&#8217;s aggression confirmed he was feeling better after a week of illness. However, the third week of the Tour is always cruel and Enric Mas (Movistar) was dropped and forced to abandon due to pain in his left knee.</p>\n<p>The constant 7% grid of the Col de la Madeleine shook out the attack group, with Armirail, Gall, Rogliƒç, Wellens, O‚ÄôConnor, Rubio and Baudin making it across to Jorgenson and Arensman.</p>\n<p>The Pogaƒçar peloton was timed at 3:00 when Visma played another tactical card and Van Aert began to pace the peloton, taking over from UAE.</p>\n<p>The Belgian only lasted for a few kilometres but it hurt everyone, with K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) dropped. Victor Campanaerts soon took over from Tiesj Benoot as Pogaƒçar sat tight on Vingegaard&#8217;s wheel, with only Jhonatan Narv√°ez and Adam Yates there if needed.</p>\n<p>Visma appeared to be in the ascendancy, with Simon Yates and then Sepp Kuss riding on the front for Vingegaard as Pogaƒçar was forced on the defensive.</p>\n<p>An attack was brewing and Vingegaard eventually danced away with Pogaƒçar on his wheel with 4.6km of the Madeleine to climb. They soon joined the attackers and Jorgenson did the pacing to the summit for Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>Behind Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora‚ÄìHansgrohe) was dropped but so was his third-place rival Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), as they raced their own battle for the spot on the final podium in Paris.</p>\n<p>Jhonatan Narv√°ez and Adam Yates were distanced when Vingegaard attacked and were soon timed at 2:30, as Jorgenson dived down the descent.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jorgenson is going a bloc, full gas,&#8221; Pogaƒçar said over race radio in a call for help from his teammates.</p>\n<p>Vingagaard could create no real decisive tactical advantage on Pogaƒçar. Jorgenson helped set the pace but Pogaƒçar seemed calm and in control. The long descent off the Madeleine and the hesitancy in the attack group helped Lipowitz gradually closed the gap, while Onley was much further behind.</p>\n<p>With 40km to go and the Col de la Loze nearing, Jorgenson became tired of pacing the attackers.</p>\n<p>When he eased and asked for help and Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard looked at each other, O&#8217;Connor and Rubio jumped away, thinking of the stage victory. Jorgenson joined them and suddenly the race changed again.</p>\n<p>The trio soon gained a minute, as Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard slowed, locked in their own tactical battle. Lipowitz joined them and bravely attacked alone. It was the right thing to do as Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard slowed even more and suddenly the chase group joined them, giving both strategically important teammates but surely ending their hopes of winning the stage.</p>\n<p>There were 14 riders in the group, including Onley as the race reshuffled again before the 26.4km to the summit of the Col de la Loze.</p>\n<p><strong>Col de la Loze summit finish</strong><br />\nPogaƒçar had Narv√°ez, Soler and Adam Yates in the group, while Vingegaard had Kuss and Simon Yates. Soler did the pacing on the lower slopes of the Col del la Loze and up to the Courchevel ski resort.</p>\n<p>Up front Jorgenson was dropped by O&#8217;Connor and Rubio, paying for his earlier hard work. Lipowitz was stronger and fresher, with his Red Bull directeur telling him to focus on his own watts and not to look back. He focused on the road ahead of him, carefully reducing the gap to the front of the race to 1:45.</p>\n<p>The Pogaƒçar group was timed at 3:00 with 17km to climb, meaning anything was still possible on the highest climb of this year&#8217;s Tour de France.</p>\n<p>With 16km to go, O&#8217;Connor threw down the gauntlet to Rubio, dancing away from the Colombian in pursuit of the stage victory. It was a brave play but the right one if he was going to hold off the GC group, Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Connor extended his lead on Rubio to 45 seconds on the easier gradients in Courchevel mid-way up the Col de la Loze, with the Pogaƒçar group at 3:20 as Jorgenson dropped back, checked if his Visma teammates needed a bidon and then eased up.</p>\n<p>There was an eerie sense of peace in the group as Simon Yates and Kuss continued to lead onto the final slopes of the Col de la Loze. When Simon Yates moved off the front, UAE surprisingly took over the pacemaking and Narv√°ez rode a steady tempo, allowing O&#8217;Connor to stay 3:00 clear. Neither Pogaƒçar or Vingegaard appeared able to go on the attack in a moment of stalemate.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz slipped back as he ran out of energy. He was caught and dropped with seven kilometres to go. Surprisingly Rogliƒç did not wait for him, riding his own race and own GC battle.</p>\n<p>With five kilometres to go, O&#8217;Connor hit the 11% section of the Col de la Loze. The huge crowd cheered him on but it was a moment of pain for the Australian. He survived and was relieved when the gradient eased and so could fight on.</p>\n<p>The final kilometres were up into the mist but fortunately earlier hailstone had eased. O&#8217;Connor kept his composure, knowing he had a three minute lead on the GC group. He had time to celebrate his second Tour de France victory and shouted out in celebration as he crossed the line and again beyond it.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar surged in the mist and cruelly caught Rubio in sight of the finish. He gained nine seconds on Vingegaard at the line to extend his lead and land a significant psychological blow on his rival before Frida&#8217;s stage to La Plagne.</p>\n<p>The 2025 Tour de France is not decided but Pogaƒçar and UAE Team Emirates-XRG took another big step towards final victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was the right thing to do as Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard slowed even more and suddenly the chase group joined them, giving both strategically important teammates but surely ending their hopes of winning the stage.</p>\n<p>There were 14 riders in the group, including Onley as the race reshuffled again before the 26.4km to the summit of the Col de la Loze.</p>\n<p><strong>Col de la Loze summit finish</strong><br />\nPogaƒçar had Narv√°ez, Soler and Adam Yates in the group, while Vingegaard had Kuss and Simon Yates. Soler did the pacing on the lower slopes of the Col del la Loze and up to the Courchevel ski resort.</p>\n<p>Up front Jorgenson was dropped by O&#8217;Connor and Rubio, paying for his earlier hard work. Lipowitz was stronger and fresher, with his Red Bull directeur telling him to focus on his own watts and not to look back. He focused on the road ahead of him, carefully reducing the gap to the front of the race to 1:45.</p>\n<p>The Pogaƒçar group was timed at 3:00 with 17km to climb, meaning anything was still possible on the highest climb of this year&#8217;s Tour de France.</p>\n<p>With 16km to go, O&#8217;Connor threw down the gauntlet to Rubio, dancing away from the Colombian in pursuit of the stage victory. It was a brave play but the right one if he was going to hold off the GC group, Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Connor extended his lead on Rubio to 45 seconds on the easier gradients in Courchevel mid-way up the Col de la Loze, with the Pogaƒçar group at 3:20 as Jorgenson dropped back, checked if his Visma teammates needed a bidon and then eased up.</p>\n<p>There was an eerie sense of peace in the group as Simon Yates and Kuss continued to lead onto the final slopes of the Col de la Loze. When Simon Yates moved off the front, UAE surprisingly took over the pacemaking and Narv√°ez rode a steady tempo, allowing O&#8217;Connor to stay 3:00 clear. Neither Pogaƒçar or Vingegaard appeared able to go on the attack in a moment of stalemate.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz slipped back as he ran out of energy. He was caught and dropped with seven kilometres to go. Surprisingly Rogliƒç did not wait for him, riding his own race and own GC battle.</p>\n<p>With five kilometres to go, O&#8217;Connor hit the 11% section of the Col de la Loze. The huge crowd cheered him on but it was a moment of pain for the Australian. He survived and was relieved when the gradient eased and so could fight on.</p>\n<p>The final kilometres were up into the mist but fortunately earlier hailstone had eased. O&#8217;Connor kept his composure, knowing he had a three minute lead on the GC group. He had time to celebrate his second Tour de France victory and shouted out in celebration as he crossed the line and again beyond it.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar surged in the mist and cruelly caught Rubio in sight of the finish. He gained nine seconds on Vingegaard at the line to extend his lead and land a significant psychological blow on his rival before Frida&#8217;s stage to La Plagne.</p>\n<p>The 2025 Tour de France is not decided but Pogaƒçar and UAE Team Emirates-XRG took another big step towards final victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep) added his name to the pantheon of greats to have conquered the summit of Mont Ventoux at the Tour de France, winning an all-out breakaway battle to the line on stage 16 to take the home nation&#8217;s first victory of the 2025 race.</p>\n<p>Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) narrowly lost out to the Frenchman, losing the breathless sprint up the final corner and kick to the line on the &#8216;Giant of Provence&#8217;, with Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious) finishing third from the break.</p>\n<p>A crazy stage, full of action from flag to flag, saw one of cycling&#8217;s most famous climbs decided by a matter of metres, with an almost 40-rider breakaway group needing a sprint to separate them after four hours, with the second race unfolding not far down the climb.</p>\n<p>Just 43 seconds behind, Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) crossed the line in the yellow jersey ahead of Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike), after withstanding all of the Dane&#8217;s attempts to attack away from him on the 15km brute of a climb. Four violent surges were made, but Pogaƒçar had an answer for all of them.</p>\n<p>He extended his lead by two seconds on a stage that more than lived up to the billing, with the fight for the GC podium behind them completely exploding on the mythical slopes which have played host to many an iconic Tour de France duel over the years.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe had another solid day for their GC ambitions, with Florian Lipowitz finishing just behind Primo≈æ Rogliƒç. The latter moved up to fifth, with K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) getting dropped, and the German consolidated his spot on the podium by finishing 36 seconds ahead of Oscar Onley.</p>\n<p>Past the finish, Paret-Peintre walked back to his teammate Ilan Van Wilder, who did a magic job to come back in the final kilometre from a dropped chasing group, giving his French teammate a final lead out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s extraordinary but it wasn&#8217;t the plan because I really thought that Pogaƒçar wanted to win the stage and that he was going to try to lock down the race,&#8221; said Paret-Peintre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t really believe it. I said to myself that if there was a big group, why not be in it? You never know. I understand that it&#8217;s possible when there&#8217;s a big group with two guys from UAE. I said to myself that they were going to try to play with the breakaway, we&#8217;ll be able to take a step back and try to play for the victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt really good. I had two teammates with me, and I told them that I had my chance of winning. A victory on the Tour is extraordinary, but on Mont Ventoux it&#8217;s even better.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ben Healy was really very strong when he attacked but I said to myself: &#8216;It&#8217;s a victory at Ventoux, you can&#8217;t give up.&#8217; Even in the last 100 metres to overtake him, I really struggled, but I had to do it. Incredible, I can hardly believe it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>With Soudal-QuickStep losing Remco Evenepoel just days ago, this was the ultimate bounce back for the Belgian squad, capturing one of the hardest-fought breakaway days in recent Tour memory.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also the first French win at the summit of Ventoux for 23 years, with Paret-Peintre adding his name to an iconic list alongside Richard Virenque, Jean-Fran√ßois Bernard, Bernard Th√©venet and Raymond Poulidor.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOne of the fastest Tours de France ever continued on stage 16, with a brutal opening phase of racing heading east of Montpellier unfolding, as the fight for the breakaway raged with an iconic finish awaiting.</p>\n<p>Mont Ventoux was the destination, the &#8216;Giant of Provence&#8217;, with 140 kilometres separating the peloton from its fabled slopes. On its 10th appearance as a summit finish location at the Tour, a rider was going to write his name into the history books, but there was a lot of racing still to do before they got there.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) kicked things off as the flag was dropped, with many others just as interested in forming a move. The first successful separation was found by a trio of Xandro Meurrise (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and the Tudor duo of Marco Haller and Marc Hirschi.</p>\n<p>They grew a 1:45-second lead, but more attacks were still to come. For the first 70km, however, UAE walked back on their words of not wanting to control all day, and Nils Politt aggressively marshalled several would-be breakaways.</p>\n<p>The big German couldn&#8217;t control things forever, though, and as the gap to the trio in front dropped to below 10 seconds and the stage entered its final 100 kilometres, finally, a larger group found their way off the front.<br />\nMore than 30 riders strong, all of the big teams were represented: Pavel Sivakov, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Tiesj Benoot, Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre, Pascal Eenkhoorn, Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal Quick-Step), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), Santiago Buitrago, Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious), Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mick van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Toms Skuji≈Ü≈° (Lidl-Trek), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Meurisse, Julian Alaphilippe, Haller, Hirschi, Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Ewen Costiou, Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Enric Mas, Will Barta, Gregor M√ºhlberger (Movistar), Alex Aranburu (Cofidis), Cl√©ment Champoussin, Simone Velasco (XDS Astana), Mathieu Burgaudeau (Total Energies), Pavel Bittner (Picnic PostNL), Michael Woods, Krists Neilands (Israel Premier Tech), Jarrad Drizners, Brent Van Moer (Lotto), Jonas Abrahamsen and Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>The group grew with a couple more Alpecin-Deceuninck riders bridging across, with an average speed already approaching 50 kph, but the next big flashpoint came with 65km to go, when Tudor decided to split things in the front, and create a more suitable lead bunch to chase the victory from.</p>\n<p>Seven ended up in the lead: Trentin, Alaphilippe, Mas, Velasco, Abrahamsen, Arensman and Wright, but the latter joined the large chase group after a puncture, where his teammate Buitrago was.</p>\n<p>Behind, UAE had allowed the break to finally build a large lead, more than six minutes as they passed Bedoin and approached the traditional climb to the mythical Mont Ventoux.</p>\n<p><strong>Two races in one up Mont Ventoux</strong><br />\nThe chasing group of 30 were still in play, 1:34 down on the six in front, but the leaders started to fracture on the final 17km, with the climb proper still not started. On the uphill roads, Abrahamsen quickly struggled, Trentin finished his turn, and only four remained: Alaphilippe, Velasco, Mas and Arensman.</p>\n<p>Huge crowds met the break as they started the ascent, with the next chapter on Ventoux&#8217;s slopes about to be written, adding to Tom Simpson&#8217;s tragic passing in 1967, Chris Froome&#8217;s uphill run in 2016, and many iconic battles over the years.</p>\n<p>A small peloton hit the lower slopes at a rapid pace, with 6:10 to make up on those in front, with Visma leading through Van Aert for Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>The attacks had started coming from the chasing break from Paret-Peintre, but in the lead, Velasco dropped, and Mas set off away from Alaphilippe and Arensman, trying to salvage a stunning stage win from what had so far been a disappointing Tour.</p>\n<p>While race radio revealed that Matteo Jorgenson had already dropped, Visma continued to press on as Sepp Kuss took over from Van Aert with Simon Yates and Vingegaard waiting in his wheel.</p>\n<p>Up front, Mas continued to impress, building a 30-second lead over his two closest chasers and a 1:30 advantage to the quartet of Woods, Paret-Peintre, Healy and Buitrago.</p>\n<p>The group of GC riders was very thin, with only Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL), Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Tobias Halland Johannessen and the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe duo of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç and Florian Lipowitz joining the UAE and Visma trains for the final 8km of climbing.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard finally decided it was time to go early, launching a monster move before the GC group reached Chalet Renard and the exposed roads. With 7km remaining, the group of favourites was blown to pieces.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar followed in the wheel as they reached Benoot from the earlier break, giving Vingegaard another pull and putting Visma&#8217;s grand plan into action. Vingegaard&#8217;s second big surge was matched again by Pogaƒçar as they passed remnants of the day&#8217;s breakaway and reduced the gap to Mas in front down to just 3:31.</p>\n<p>Mas passed the 5km to go barrier still in the lead, but a rampant Healy had reduced his lead to just 22 seconds, with the Irish rider and Paret-Peintre hot in pursuit as they pulled through the large crowds and onto the iconic exposed roads to the summit.</p>\n<p>Campenaerts had waited from the break to give Vingegaard another turn on the front, but the third attack from the two-time winner again could not shift Pogaƒçar, who had the answer for everything. They melted the break&#8217;s gap, and it looked for a moment like they could catch them, but eventually they cancelled each other out.</p>\n<p>Healy and Paret-Peintre took a break from throwing big haymakers at each other, having dropped Mas, allowing the Spanish rider to get back in, and Buitrago to join the party out in front inside the final 1.5km.</p>\n<p>More attacks were attempted, but the leaders continued to play games before the final 500 metres, where Van Wilder appeared from seemingly nowhere to do a final pull for Paret-Peintre, winding things up in the sprint for victory.</p>\n<p>Healy sprinted out of his wheel and led into the final uphill bend to the finish, but Paret-Peintre had enough in the tank to sprint by him and take a historic victory for France.</p>\n<p>With the win disappearing up the road, Pogaƒçar bided his time but finally countered with an attack of his own, but Vingegaard was able to respond in his wheel and surge for a fourth time, which the yellow jersey again marked.</p>\n<p>This stalemate continued all the way to the line, with the second-place rider on GC unable to shake his rival once again, despite an all-out assault of Mont Ventoux. The gap between them, with only the Alps remaining as a place to make the difference, was marginally extended to 4:15.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Incredible, I can hardly believe it!&#8221;</p>\n<p>With Soudal-QuickStep losing Remco Evenepoel just days ago, this was the ultimate bounce back for the Belgian squad, capturing one of the hardest-fought breakaway days in recent Tour memory.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also the first French win at the summit of Ventoux for 23 years, with Paret-Peintre adding his name to an iconic list alongside Richard Virenque, Jean-Fran√ßois Bernard, Bernard Th√©venet and Raymond Poulidor.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOne of the fastest Tours de France ever continued on stage 16, with a brutal opening phase of racing heading east of Montpellier unfolding, as the fight for the breakaway raged with an iconic finish awaiting.</p>\n<p>Mont Ventoux was the destination, the &#8216;Giant of Provence&#8217;, with 140 kilometres separating the peloton from its fabled slopes. On its 10th appearance as a summit finish location at the Tour, a rider was going to write his name into the history books, but there was a lot of racing still to do before they got there.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) kicked things off as the flag was dropped, with many others just as interested in forming a move. The first successful separation was found by a trio of Xandro Meurrise (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and the Tudor duo of Marco Haller and Marc Hirschi.</p>\n<p>They grew a 1:45-second lead, but more attacks were still to come. For the first 70km, however, UAE walked back on their words of not wanting to control all day, and Nils Politt aggressively marshalled several would-be breakaways.</p>\n<p>The big German couldn&#8217;t control things forever, though, and as the gap to the trio in front dropped to below 10 seconds and the stage entered its final 100 kilometres, finally, a larger group found their way off the front.<br />\nMore than 30 riders strong, all of the big teams were represented: Pavel Sivakov, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Tiesj Benoot, Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre, Pascal Eenkhoorn, Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal Quick-Step), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), Santiago Buitrago, Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious), Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mick van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Toms Skuji≈Ü≈° (Lidl-Trek), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Meurisse, Julian Alaphilippe, Haller, Hirschi, Matteo Trentin (Tudor), Ewen Costiou, Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Enric Mas, Will Barta, Gregor M√ºhlberger (Movistar), Alex Aranburu (Cofidis), Cl√©ment Champoussin, Simone Velasco (XDS Astana), Mathieu Burgaudeau (Total Energies), Pavel Bittner (Picnic PostNL), Michael Woods, Krists Neilands (Israel Premier Tech), Jarrad Drizners, Brent Van Moer (Lotto), Jonas Abrahamsen and Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>The group grew with a couple more Alpecin-Deceuninck riders bridging across, with an average speed already approaching 50 kph, but the next big flashpoint came with 65km to go, when Tudor decided to split things in the front, and create a more suitable lead bunch to chase the victory from.</p>\n<p>Seven ended up in the lead: Trentin, Alaphilippe, Mas, Velasco, Abrahamsen, Arensman and Wright, but the latter joined the large chase group after a puncture, where his teammate Buitrago was.</p>\n<p>Behind, UAE had allowed the break to finally build a large lead, more than six minutes as they passed Bedoin and approached the traditional climb to the mythical Mont Ventoux.</p>\n<p><strong>Two races in one up Mont Ventoux</strong><br />\nThe chasing group of 30 were still in play, 1:34 down on the six in front, but the leaders started to fracture on the final 17km, with the climb proper still not started. On the uphill roads, Abrahamsen quickly struggled, Trentin finished his turn, and only four remained: Alaphilippe, Velasco, Mas and Arensman.</p>\n<p>Huge crowds met the break as they started the ascent, with the next chapter on Ventoux&#8217;s slopes about to be written, adding to Tom Simpson&#8217;s tragic passing in 1967, Chris Froome&#8217;s uphill run in 2016, and many iconic battles over the years.</p>\n<p>A small peloton hit the lower slopes at a rapid pace, with 6:10 to make up on those in front, with Visma leading through Van Aert for Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>The attacks had started coming from the chasing break from Paret-Peintre, but in the lead, Velasco dropped, and Mas set off away from Alaphilippe and Arensman, trying to salvage a stunning stage win from what had so far been a disappointing Tour.</p>\n<p>While race radio revealed that Matteo Jorgenson had already dropped, Visma continued to press on as Sepp Kuss took over from Van Aert with Simon Yates and Vingegaard waiting in his wheel.</p>\n<p>Up front, Mas continued to impress, building a 30-second lead over his two closest chasers and a 1:30 advantage to the quartet of Woods, Paret-Peintre, Healy and Buitrago.</p>\n<p>The group of GC riders was very thin, with only Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL), Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Tobias Halland Johannessen and the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe duo of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç and Florian Lipowitz joining the UAE and Visma trains for the final 8km of climbing.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard finally decided it was time to go early, launching a monster move before the GC group reached Chalet Renard and the exposed roads. With 7km remaining, the group of favourites was blown to pieces.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar followed in the wheel as they reached Benoot from the earlier break, giving Vingegaard another pull and putting Visma&#8217;s grand plan into action. Vingegaard&#8217;s second big surge was matched again by Pogaƒçar as they passed remnants of the day&#8217;s breakaway and reduced the gap to Mas in front down to just 3:31.</p>\n<p>Mas passed the 5km to go barrier still in the lead, but a rampant Healy had reduced his lead to just 22 seconds, with the Irish rider and Paret-Peintre hot in pursuit as they pulled through the large crowds and onto the iconic exposed roads to the summit.</p>\n<p>Campenaerts had waited from the break to give Vingegaard another turn on the front, but the third attack from the two-time winner again could not shift Pogaƒçar, who had the answer for everything. They melted the break&#8217;s gap, and it looked for a moment like they could catch them, but eventually they cancelled each other out.</p>\n<p>Healy and Paret-Peintre took a break from throwing big haymakers at each other, having dropped Mas, allowing the Spanish rider to get back in, and Buitrago to join the party out in front inside the final 1.5km.</p>\n<p>More attacks were attempted, but the leaders continued to play games before the final 500 metres, where Van Wilder appeared from seemingly nowhere to do a final pull for Paret-Peintre, winding things up in the sprint for victory.</p>\n<p>Healy sprinted out of his wheel and led into the final uphill bend to the finish, but Paret-Peintre had enough in the tank to sprint by him and take a historic victory for France.</p>\n<p>With the win disappearing up the road, Pogaƒçar bided his time but finally countered with an attack of his own, but Vingegaard was able to respond in his wheel and surge for a fourth time, which the yellow jersey again marked.</p>\n<p>This stalemate continued all the way to the line, with the second-place rider on GC unable to shake his rival once again, despite an all-out assault of Mont Ventoux. The gap between them, with only the Alps remaining as a place to make the difference, was marginally extended to 4:15.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) joined the elite club of riders who have won stages in all three Grand Tours after securing a 40km solo victory on stage 15 at the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>The Belgian Champion attacked from the day&#8217;s breakaway over the top of the final climb, Pas du Sant, and after high-fiving fans on the final straight, crossed the finish line 1:06 ahead of runner-up and solo chaser Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 1:36 ahead of third-placed Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) from a larger chase group in Carcassonne.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a very special victory. Everyone knows the Tour de France and everyone wants to ride the Tour de France, and not many people win at the Tour de France, so it is a very beautiful victory,&#8221; said Wellens, who had already won two stages at both the Giro d&#8217;Italia and Vuelta a Espa√±a during his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt super good before the stage. Before the stage, Nils [Politt] and me were laughing a little bit that we would go in the break, suddenly there was a crash and I hope everyone was OK. I kept on attacking and followed one move, and I was in the breakaway,&#8221; Wellens recalled the start of the decisive move at just over 100km out, and three ascents to cross.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the climb, it exploded again, and then on the last climb of the day, I felt really good. I saw the others also felt good, but I knew I had to go solo. At the top of the climb, I knew I had my moment and had the legs to keep it until the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wellens&#8217; teammate and yellow-jersey wearer, Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Emirates-XRG), finished the stage safely in the main peloton at 6:07 later. The Slovenian continues to lead the GC standings with 4:13 ahead of Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 7:53 ahead of Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) as the race heads into the second rest day at the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Many have speculated that there will be limited chances for UAE Team Emirates-XRG riders to secure stage wins now, given the team&#8217;s focus on the overall title with Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Wellens agreed with that statement but also said, &#8220;I had the opportunity, I took it, and I had the legs to finish it. But, of course, I take my victory directly for yellow with Tadej in Paris.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de France moved away from the Pyrenees on stage 15 for a transition day as the peloton travelled east from Muret to Carcassonne on a day that included one intermediate sprint and three ascents: C√¥te de Saint-Ferr√©ol (cat. 3) at 72.8km, C√¥te de Sor√®ze (cat. 3) at 86.6km and Pas du Sant (cat. 2) at 116.6km before descent and fast run-in to the finish line at Carcassonne.</p>\n<p>With around 2,400m of climbing, it suited a versatile rider, and after three days of climbing that finished at Hautacam, Peyragudes and Luchon-Superbagn√®res, many of the GC contenders and climbers were content for a day of reprieve, making it a prime opportunity for a large breakaway to go clear.</p>\n<p><strong>A big fight for the breakaway</strong><br />\nIt was a hectic start to the race with numerous attacks and several crashes in the opening kilometres. Alaphilippe was part of a crash, and while he was back on his bike quickly, he appeared to have hurt his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard was also involved in a crash and pile-up that happened just behind Pogaƒçar, but he too managed to get back up and into the field, with the help of his Visma-Lease a Bike teammates.</p>\n<p>It was a fast day of racing with the peloton reaching average speeds of 48kph, but that didn&#8217;t stop a breakaway from emerging on the flatter sections at just over the 100km mark.</p>\n<p>The riders in the move appeared content to roll through: Wellens and Campenaerts, along with Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain-Victorious), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Mathieu van der Poel and Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies), Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL), Alexey Lutsenko and Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech), Arnaud de Lie and Jarrad Drizners (Lotto).</p>\n<p>Van der Poel started the day with 190 points in the green-jersey classification, just 61 points behind leader Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek). Van der Poel took the full points offered at the only intermediate sprint of the day in Saint-F√©lix-Lauragais, moving himself closer to the top of the standings.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Milan appeared to struggle to stay with the main field behind the breakaway, yo-yoing off the back of the peloton early in the race, which caused many to question whether he would be able to make the roughly 28-minute time cut. He ended up finishing in the gruppetto 22 minutes back and is still safely in the green jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>A hilly second half</strong><br />\nAs the main peloton raced toward the first two category 3 climbs of the day &#8211; C√¥te de Saint-Ferr√©ol and C√¥te de Sor√®ze &#8211; the gap was only 30 seconds and a chase group bridged across to the breakaway that included Michael Storer (Tudor), Quinn Simmons, Thibau Nys and Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Warren Barguil and Oscar Onley (Picnic Post NL), 4th overall in the GC standings at the start of the day, along with Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious), Michael Valgren (EF Education EasyPost), Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe), Martin Guillaume and Valentine (Groupama FDJ), and Xandro Meurisse (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>However, the large group split apart on the upper slopes of the C√¥te de Sor√®ze with eight riders emerging: Wellens, Campenaerts, Powless, Mohoriƒç, Rodriguez, Simmons, Lutsenko and Storer pushing 40 seconds ahead of the 23-riders chasing group, with the yellow-jersey group of Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) more than four minutes behind.</p>\n<p>The breakaway expanded to nine as Leknessund bridged across just before they reached the lower slopes of the final climb of the day, category 2 Pas du Sant.</p>\n<p>The steeper slopes of the ascent continued well past the actual KOM line, and onto the Col du Fontbruno, which proved to be a demanding ask for some of the breakaway riders, while other riders from the chase group behind saw it as an opportunity to bridge across.</p>\n<p>Simmons, Storer, Wellens and Campenaerts pulled away from the group, leaving Nys, Madouas, Jegat and Leknessund chasing at 40 seconds back. Further back, Rodriguez, Vlasov, Lutsenko, Powless, and Barguil were more than a minute behind, while Mohoriƒç had dropped entirely back to the main group.</p>\n<p>Storer took advantage of the additional 8km of climbing and attacked, but Simmons, Wellens and Campenaerts clawed their way back, and the quartet settled into a steady pace roughly 20 seconds ahead of Rogriguez, Vlasov, Barguil and Lutsenko.</p>\n<p>Wellens launched his winning attack with 43km to go, over the top of the climb and pushed his lead out over the rolling terrain before the final descent.</p>\n<p>With no significant chase, the Belgian increased his lead to nearly two minutes as he hit the flatter sections through Carcassonne.</p>\n<p>The two chase groups behind Wellens reconnected with Storer, Simmons, Campenaerts, Rodriguez, Vlasov, Barguil, and Lutsenko, but were unable to close the gap on Wellens. Eventually, the larger chase group behind them caught up, which included Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p>Wellens had enough time in hand to enjoy his victory, celebrating along the final straight away, giving high-fives to cheering fans along the side of the road before crossing the line with the prestigious win.</p>\n<p>Behind, his compatriot Campenaerts managed to sneak away to claim second place while Alaphilippe won the larger chase-group sprint for third.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=15&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=15&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) joined the elite club of riders who have won stages in all three Grand Tours after securing a 40km solo victory on stage 15 at the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>The Belgian Champion attacked from the day&#8217;s breakaway over the top of the final climb, Pas du Sant, and after high-fiving fans on the final straight, crossed the finish line 1:06 ahead of runner-up and solo chaser Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 1:36 ahead of third-placed Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) from a larger chase group in Carcassonne.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a very special victory. Everyone knows the Tour de France and everyone wants to ride the Tour de France, and not many people win at the Tour de France, so it is a very beautiful victory,&#8221; said Wellens, who had already won two stages at both the Giro d&#8217;Italia and Vuelta a Espa√±a during his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt super good before the stage. Before the stage, Nils [Politt] and me were laughing a little bit that we would go in the break, suddenly there was a crash and I hope everyone was OK. I kept on attacking and followed one move, and I was in the breakaway,&#8221; Wellens recalled the start of the decisive move at just over 100km out, and three ascents to cross.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On the climb, it exploded again, and then on the last climb of the day, I felt really good. I saw the others also felt good, but I knew I had to go solo. At the top of the climb, I knew I had my moment and had the legs to keep it until the end.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Wellens&#8217; teammate and yellow-jersey wearer, Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Emirates-XRG), finished the stage safely in the main peloton at 6:07 later. The Slovenian continues to lead the GC standings with 4:13 ahead of Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 7:53 ahead of Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) as the race heads into the second rest day at the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>Many have speculated that there will be limited chances for UAE Team Emirates-XRG riders to secure stage wins now, given the team&#8217;s focus on the overall title with Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Wellens agreed with that statement but also said, &#8220;I had the opportunity, I took it, and I had the legs to finish it. But, of course, I take my victory directly for yellow with Tadej in Paris.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de France moved away from the Pyrenees on stage 15 for a transition day as the peloton travelled east from Muret to Carcassonne on a day that included one intermediate sprint and three ascents: C√¥te de Saint-Ferr√©ol (cat. 3) at 72.8km, C√¥te de Sor√®ze (cat. 3) at 86.6km and Pas du Sant (cat. 2) at 116.6km before descent and fast run-in to the finish line at Carcassonne.</p>\n<p>With around 2,400m of climbing, it suited a versatile rider, and after three days of climbing that finished at Hautacam, Peyragudes and Luchon-Superbagn√®res, many of the GC contenders and climbers were content for a day of reprieve, making it a prime opportunity for a large breakaway to go clear.</p>\n<p><strong>A big fight for the breakaway</strong><br />\nIt was a hectic start to the race with numerous attacks and several crashes in the opening kilometres. Alaphilippe was part of a crash, and while he was back on his bike quickly, he appeared to have hurt his shoulder.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard was also involved in a crash and pile-up that happened just behind Pogaƒçar, but he too managed to get back up and into the field, with the help of his Visma-Lease a Bike teammates.</p>\n<p>It was a fast day of racing with the peloton reaching average speeds of 48kph, but that didn&#8217;t stop a breakaway from emerging on the flatter sections at just over the 100km mark.</p>\n<p>The riders in the move appeared content to roll through: Wellens and Campenaerts, along with Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep), Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain-Victorious), Cl√©ment Russo (Groupama-FDJ), Mathieu van der Poel and Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies), Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL), Alexey Lutsenko and Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech), Arnaud de Lie and Jarrad Drizners (Lotto).</p>\n<p>Van der Poel started the day with 190 points in the green-jersey classification, just 61 points behind leader Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek). Van der Poel took the full points offered at the only intermediate sprint of the day in Saint-F√©lix-Lauragais, moving himself closer to the top of the standings.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Milan appeared to struggle to stay with the main field behind the breakaway, yo-yoing off the back of the peloton early in the race, which caused many to question whether he would be able to make the roughly 28-minute time cut.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) took a solo win on the savage stage 14 summit finish of Superbagn√®res. He held off the sparring pair of Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates XRG) and Jonas Vingegaard (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), gifting Ineos Grenadiers a rare return to Grand Tour glory.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard emerged through the fragments of breakaway and chase groups of the stage&#8217;s early kilometres, from which Arensman was the sole survivor.</p>\n<p>He held a narrow lead of just over one minute against the surging accelerations of the two main yellow jersey contenders, who rode free of the major favourites group with 4km remaining. Unable to drop one another, Pogaƒçar would prove the strongest in the final sprint to take second place on stage 14, along with a five-second margin and accompanying bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Behind them, British rider Oscar Onley (Team Picnic PostNL) was the strongest of the remaining contenders. He finished fourth, just over one minute behind Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s margin over Vingegaard is now 4:13 in the general classification, and 7:53 over third place Florian Lipowitz (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>Onley&#8217;s performance today was enough to move him to fourth position overall, but at a yawning 9:18 margin to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today was probably one of the hardest mountain stages I&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Vingegaard said after the race finish. &#8220;It was a hard day, I think, for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike had both Sepp Kuss and Simon Yates in the day&#8217;s early breakaway, sparking speculation of a subtle tactical plan. However, Vingegaard downplayed the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, to go for the stage, actually,&#8221; he explained when asked why they were positioned ahead. &#8220;We wanted to try to win the stage with one of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t follow Arensman in the front ‚Äì he did a good job,&#8221; Vingegaard added. &#8220;He did a good performance on the last climb. So congratulations to him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arensman, predictably, was somewhat more euphoric in his reflections on his stage victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wow. I can&#8217;t really believe it,&#8221; Arensman said after the stage finish. &#8220;Going through my first Tour, I just wanted to experience everything. I had to be really patient in the first week because it was all pretty punchy, and I had to wait until the mountains. The first opportunity I got, I was already second on the Le Mont-Dore stage, which was amazing, an amazing experience in my first Tour. But this is unbelievable now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked about the stage&#8217;s tactics, with two Ineos riders in the breakaway, Arensman played down the idea of a master plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way I did it today, I think, and Carlos [Rodriguez] in that group was also super strong and did a really good job for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know, I think I just had amazing legs and the shape of my life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the ascent of Superbagn√®res, Arensman was aware that his margin was large yet fragile in the event of an animated GC battle. &#8220;I heard the gap with the GC group, and I thought with Tadej and Jonas, three-and-a-half minutes probably isn&#8217;t enough. I have to move. Maybe it&#8217;s suicide, maybe it&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I held them off, but I was really fading on this last climb, the second half. But I think with all the spectators, they gave me an extra few watts, and I just could hold them off. It&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winning a stage wasn&#8217;t really the ambition when I showed up at my first Tour, to be honest. I just wanted to experience the Tour de France, the biggest race in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIn stark contrast to the unbearable heat of stage 13, the peloton set off from a cool and rainy Pau.</p>\n<p>Given the 5,000m of climbing and brutal 182.6km profile ahead, tensions were high &#8211; as were ambitions of breakaway glory. Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) was active and aggressive among the early attacks, targeting the green jersey points on offer in the intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>While it was a day for sensational racing, stage 14 would prove a day of disappointment for many, and poor fortune began to unfold early, with Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) crashing into road furniture in the early kilometres. He was able to remount and continue racing, but the Lidl-Trek team leader was carrying a substantial injury.</p>\n<p>While Skjelmose battled on, Steff Cras (TotalEnergies) became the first rider to abandon the stage. Soon after, following several stops at the medical car, the injuries would prove too substantial for Skjelmose, and he too abandoned.</p>\n<p>Despite a flurry of attacks, by the base of the Col du Tourmalet, the peloton was largely still together, with Lidl-Trek delivering an intermediate sprint victory to Milan to further his lead in the overall sprint competition.</p>\n<p>The Tourmalet, and real drama, was now looming ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>After a difficult stage 13 time trial, all eyes were on Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) for signs of fatigue, and observers did not have to wait long.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel was quickly dropped from the yellow jersey group, and was haemorrhaging chunks of time between conversations with his team car, and domestique Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep) nursing him up the incline.</p>\n<p>A large breakaway group of about 20 riders soon formed on the climb, which thinned down to a three-man selection of Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Einer Rubio (Movistar Team), and King of the Mountains Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious). Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) was the only major GC contender, sitting in eighth place, to be near the front of the race as he attempted to bridge to the leading trio.</p>\n<p>While the front of the race was taking shape, Evenepoel&#8217;s outlook worsened, and as the front of the race neared the 100km mark, he slowed to a crawl. After handing his bottle to a young supporter, he approached his team car and departed the race.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, up front, Lenny Martinez attacked the trio of riders to go solo and crested the Col du Tourmalet alone.</p>\n<p>Behind him, in the GC favourites group, UAE Team Emirates-XRG controlled the pace in the main group, which trailed Martinez by 3:30 atop the Tourmalet.</p>\n<p><strong>Cols and convergence</strong><br />\nThe foggy descent from the Tourmalet saw a chase group hack away at Martinez&#8217;s advantage, with Sepp Kuss (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) and Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team) leading the chase.</p>\n<p>They were soon upon the Col d&#8217;Aspin, a relatively short 5km at 7.4%, where Kuss and Paret-Peintre chipped away at the gap to Martinez.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman went over the summit solo, but he was soon joined by the two chasers on the descent.</p>\n<p>As the riders entered the final 50 kilometres, the leading trio was 1:50 ahead of the chasers and 3:45 ahead of the peloton. The gap may have seemed large, but it was easily toppled by the hint of a GC battle on the final two ascents.</p>\n<p>The trio began the Col de Peyresourde with only 20 seconds over the five-man chase group, which contained Johannessen, Simon Yates (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Arensman, Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers), and Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Team Jayco AlUla).</p>\n<p>A convergence took place on the foothills of Peyresourde, as the trio and chase group formed a new leading group of Martinez, Kuss, Paret-Peintre, Johannessen, Arensman and Rodr√≠guez.</p>\n<p>The climb was a short 7.1km at 8.1%. Near the halfway point, we saw Arensman take flight with a solo attack. Martinez and Johannessen briefly followed that, but they were quickly shed as Arensman made a sensational ascent to pull out a lead of over a minute by the time he reached the summit.</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers had played their hand perfectly. Behind Arensman, his teammate Carlos Rodr√≠guez sat comfortably in the main chase group, able to ride wheels. That group, now 90 seconds behind Arensman, contained Paret-Peintre, Martinez, and Johannessen.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) took a solo win on the savage stage 14 summit finish of Superbagn√®res. He held off the sparring pair of Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates XRG) and Jonas Vingegaard (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), gifting Ineos Grenadiers a rare return to Grand Tour glory.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard emerged through the fragments of breakaway and chase groups of the stage&#8217;s early kilometres, from which Arensman was the sole survivor.</p>\n<p>He held a narrow lead of just over one minute against the surging accelerations of the two main yellow jersey contenders, who rode free of the major favourites group with 4km remaining. Unable to drop one another, Pogaƒçar would prove the strongest in the final sprint to take second place on stage 14, along with a five-second margin and accompanying bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Behind them, British rider Oscar Onley (Team Picnic PostNL) was the strongest of the remaining contenders. He finished fourth, just over one minute behind Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar&#8217;s margin over Vingegaard is now 4:13 in the general classification, and 7:53 over third place Florian Lipowitz (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>Onley&#8217;s performance today was enough to move him to fourth position overall, but at a yawning 9:18 margin to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today was probably one of the hardest mountain stages I&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; Vingegaard said after the race finish. &#8220;It was a hard day, I think, for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike had both Sepp Kuss and Simon Yates in the day&#8217;s early breakaway, sparking speculation of a subtle tactical plan. However, Vingegaard downplayed the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Basically, to go for the stage, actually,&#8221; he explained when asked why they were positioned ahead. &#8220;We wanted to try to win the stage with one of them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t follow Arensman in the front ‚Äì he did a good job,&#8221; Vingegaard added. &#8220;He did a good performance on the last climb. So congratulations to him.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Arensman, predictably, was somewhat more euphoric in his reflections on his stage victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Wow. I can&#8217;t really believe it,&#8221; Arensman said after the stage finish. &#8220;Going through my first Tour, I just wanted to experience everything. I had to be really patient in the first week because it was all pretty punchy, and I had to wait until the mountains. The first opportunity I got, I was already second on the Le Mont-Dore stage, which was amazing, an amazing experience in my first Tour. But this is unbelievable now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked about the stage&#8217;s tactics, with two Ineos riders in the breakaway, Arensman played down the idea of a master plan.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The way I did it today, I think, and Carlos [Rodriguez] in that group was also super strong and did a really good job for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know, I think I just had amazing legs and the shape of my life.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the ascent of Superbagn√®res, Arensman was aware that his margin was large yet fragile in the event of an animated GC battle. &#8220;I heard the gap with the GC group, and I thought with Tadej and Jonas, three-and-a-half minutes probably isn&#8217;t enough. I have to move. Maybe it&#8217;s suicide, maybe it&#8217;s not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I held them off, but I was really fading on this last climb, the second half. But I think with all the spectators, they gave me an extra few watts, and I just could hold them off. It&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winning a stage wasn&#8217;t really the ambition when I showed up at my first Tour, to be honest. I just wanted to experience the Tour de France, the biggest race in the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIn stark contrast to the unbearable heat of stage 13, the peloton set off from a cool and rainy Pau.</p>\n<p>Given the 5,000m of climbing and brutal 182.6km profile ahead, tensions were high &#8211; as were ambitions of breakaway glory. Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) was active and aggressive among the early attacks, targeting the green jersey points on offer in the intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>While it was a day for sensational racing, stage 14 would prove a day of disappointment for many, and poor fortune began to unfold early, with Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) crashing into road furniture in the early kilometres. He was able to remount and continue racing, but the Lidl-Trek team leader was carrying a substantial injury.</p>\n<p>While Skjelmose battled on, Steff Cras (TotalEnergies) became the first rider to abandon the stage. Soon after, following several stops at the medical car, the injuries would prove too substantial for Skjelmose, and he too abandoned.</p>\n<p>Despite a flurry of attacks, by the base of the Col du Tourmalet, the peloton was largely still together, with Lidl-Trek delivering an intermediate sprint victory to Milan to further his lead in the overall sprint competition.</p>\n<p>The Tourmalet, and real drama, was now looming ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>After a difficult stage 13 time trial, all eyes were on Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step) for signs of fatigue, and observers did not have to wait long.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel was quickly dropped from the yellow jersey group, and was haemorrhaging chunks of time between conversations with his team car, and domestique Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep) nursing him up the incline.</p>\n<p>A large breakaway group of about 20 riders soon formed on the climb, which thinned down to a three-man selection of Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Einer Rubio (Movistar Team), and King of the Mountains Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious). Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) was the only major GC contender, sitting in eighth place, to be near the front of the race as he attempted to bridge to the leading trio.</p>\n<p>While the front of the race was taking shape, Evenepoel&#8217;s outlook worsened, and as the front of the race neared the 100km mark, he slowed to a crawl. After handing his bottle to a young supporter, he approached his team car and departed the race.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, up front, Lenny Martinez attacked the trio of riders to go solo and crested the Col du Tourmalet alone.</p>\n<p>Behind him, in the GC favourites group, UAE Team Emirates-XRG controlled the pace in the main group, which trailed Martinez by 3:30 atop the Tourmalet.</p>\n<p><strong>Cols and convergence</strong><br />\nThe foggy descent from the Tourmalet saw a chase group hack away at Martinez&#8217;s advantage, with Sepp Kuss (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) and Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team) leading the chase.</p>\n<p>They were soon upon the Col d&#8217;Aspin, a relatively short 5km at 7.4%, where Kuss and Paret-Peintre chipped away at the gap to Martinez.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman went over the summit solo, but he was soon joined by the two chasers on the descent.</p>\n<p>As the riders entered the final 50 kilometres, the leading trio was 1:50 ahead of the chasers and 3:45 ahead of the peloton. The gap may have seemed large, but it was easily toppled by the hint of a GC battle on the final two ascents.</p>\n<p>The trio began the Col de Peyresourde with only 20 seconds over the five-man chase group, which contained Johannessen, Simon Yates (Team Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Arensman, Carlos Rodr√≠guez (Ineos Grenadiers), and Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Team Jayco AlUla).</p>\n<p>A convergence took place on the foothills of Peyresourde, as the trio and chase group formed a new leading group of Martinez, Kuss, Paret-Peintre, Johannessen, Arensman and Rodr√≠guez.</p>\n<p>The climb was a short 7.1km at 8.1%. Near the halfway point, we saw Arensman take flight with a solo attack. Martinez and Johannessen briefly followed that, but they were quickly shed as Arensman made a sensational ascent to pull out a lead of over a minute by the time he reached the summit.</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers had played their hand perfectly. Behind Arensman, his teammate Carlos Rodr√≠guez sat comfortably in the main chase group, able to ride wheels. That group, now 90 seconds behind Arensman, contained Paret-Peintre, Martinez, and Johannessen.

Meanwhile, sole chaser Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team) hovered 20 seconds ahead of the GC group.</p>\n<p>One victim of the pace was K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), who began to drift from Pogaƒçar&#8217;s GC favourites group.</p>\n<p>The much-anticipated attack from the main group came with 4km remaining, as Vingegaard made an explosive strike on the small selection of riders &#8211; only Pogaƒçar was able to follow, and Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) impressively wrestled across the gap.</p>\n<p>From there, with Gall swallowed up and Lipowitz dropped by successive attacks and counter-attacks between Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, the top three of the stage finish seemed certain, with only the order to be determined.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates XRG) further extended his lead in the 2025 Tour de France, powering to his fourth stage win of the race in the 10.9km stage 13 individual time trial to Peyragudes and putting more time into his rivals.</p>\n<p>Topping Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) by 36 seconds, Pogaƒçar now has a lead of 4:07 over the Dane in the general classification, and he did it without using any aero bars &#8211; completing the stage on his standard climbing road bike.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy,&#8221; Pogaƒçar said. &#8220;This time trial was quite a big question mark already in December for me. I wanted everything to be perfect, and the team delivered just in the final moments for everything to be on top.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was really targeting to do from start to finish all out, and just try to smash as much as possible on the pedals. I almost blew up in the end, but I saw the timer on the top, and it gave me an extra push because I saw that I&#8217;m gonna win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He explained that the choice of bike to use was the biggest decision of the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, we&#8217;re racing on road bikes like 99% of the time. So in the end, we did the calculations. If you cannot push on the TT bike as much as on the road bike, and they&#8217;re about the same time, I decided to be more comfortable, the way I was riding the last 12 stages with the same bike. In the end, it worked well for me,&#8221; he said, adding that he didn&#8217;t even have a race radio during his ride.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I decided to go without a radio because the tactic was all out from the beginning to the top. So I was just relying on the time checks. I saw the first one, I was already five seconds in green or something, and this gave me motivation. Then, the second one was a bit bigger, and then I knew that it&#8217;s a good pace and I&#8217;m on a good time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was thinking not to blow up in the first part, and I almost did in the end &#8211; maybe the last three kilometers from three to two &#8211; I took a deep breath, reset a little bit, just dropped a little bit of power, because I knew that the last kick is super, super steep and I wanted to come to the last steep part still with somewhat good legs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vingegaard used aero bars and his massive, red-and-white Giro TT helmet, showed he is approaching top form with an impressive ascent that brought him powering past time trial world champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quickstep) before the summit. Putting more than two minutes into the Belgian, Vingegaard extended his advantage over Evenepoel in the GC standings to 3:17.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was bad,&#8221; a downcast Evenepoel said. &#8220;It was obvious with a normal feeling I should end up with a top three on a day like this. It was really bad.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope there won‚Äôt be an explanation. It‚Äôs just now a few days like this &#8211; hopefully not tomorrow. As I said, my start was pretty good but then five minutes into the climb I was feeling pretty bad and I couldn‚Äôt keep pushing the power that I had to. A really bad performance from myself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The biggest surprise of the day, aside from Evenepoel&#8217;s shocking time loss, was the return of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who was third on the stage at 1:20, notably 36 seconds quicker than his teammate Florian Lipowitz.</p>\n<p>The performance only put a small dent in Rogliƒç&#8217;s GC demise, and he remains seventh overall at 8:50 while Lipowitz gained time over Evenepoel, closing within six seconds of the Soudal-Quickstep rider in the GC standings.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel, third overall, will head into another clutch stage to Superbagn√®res with Lipowitz hot on his heels. Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNl), seventh on the day, kept his podium hopes alive, getting the better of Evenepoel by 33 seconds.</p>\n<p>Even K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) made gains over the Olympic time trial champion, beating him by four seconds. The quartet, plus Rogliƒç, are now separated by just 1:26 in the fight for third place.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nClear skies, seasonable temperatures and a tailwind on the run-out from Loudenvielle made the conditions perfect for a fast individual time trial to the Peyragudes altiport. Following stage 12&#8217;s Hautacam obliteration by Tadej Pogaƒçar, the Tour de France peloton would have to submit themselves to the Pyrenees once more for stage 13, albeit in the form of a solo mountain climb.</p>\n<p>Rather than multiple ascents, stage 13 presented the riders with just one test, an 8km, 7.9% time trial ascent of Peyragudes featuring three flat kilometres to begin for a total of 10.9km. The mountain, concluding with steep 16% slopes at the altiport, was back on the Tour for a fourth time, following road stages in 2012, 2017, and 2022.</p>\n<p>The 171 riders of the Tour would be spread out over a four-hour span. The first riders to head out on route included a raft of sprinters and domestiques at the bottom of the Tour de France GC standings, with lanterne rouge Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies) the first man off. The Frenchman duly set the quickest time at the top, completing his ride in 30:01.67.</p>\n<p>He would quickly be usurped by a host of others, including Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto). The Belgian climber was easily the fastest of the early runners at 27:49.88. His time would stand until Australian champion Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), who powered through the second checkpoint after 7.6km a minute up, en route to setting by far the quickest time of 24:58.44.</p>\n<p>The next challenger at the top of the leaderboards was polka dot jersey wearer Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), with the Frenchman shedding 10 seconds to Plapp at the intermediate.</p>\n<p>He couldn&#8217;t make up the time by the finish line, however, completing his ride with a time of 25:21.93, 24 seconds off hot seat holder Plapp. 20 minutes later, former world time trial champion Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) slotted into third, albeit some way down with a time of 27:24.83.</p>\n<p>The times of Plapp and Martinez proved unbeatable at the top of the standings for some time, with Cl√©ment Champoussin (XDS-Astana) going third a minute up on Foss with a time of 26:20.89.</p>\n<p>Fellow Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor), the 105th rider to start, was also going well, jumping into third ahead of Champoussin at 26:03.28.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, French time trial champion Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) showed his form following his breakaway effort on the road to Hautacam, setting a time of 26:12.64, three seconds up on Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious), but also in third.</p>\n<p>Next up to take third place was Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost), who became the third man to break the 26-minute barrier, crossing the line in 25:53.57. Shortly after the Australian finished his effort, however, it was, after hours of waiting, time for the big GC names to get underway.</p>\n<p>22nd-placed Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) started out strong, threatening to break the Plapp-Martinez duopoly at the top, with the second-quickest time at the 7.6km intermediate checkpoint.</p>\n<p>At the line, the Briton was quicker than Martinez but fell just short of Plapp&#8217;s time, his time of 25:15.62, leaving Plapp as the only man under 25 minutes. Further down the mountain, a few of the other GC super-domestiques and riders 20 minutes off the lead put in maximal effort.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease A Bike domestique Sepp Kuss caught and passed his teammate Simon Yates just before the line, but his own time put him eighth overall. Cristian Rodr√≠guez (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) also did well, going sixth at 26:08.64.</p>\n<p><strong>The GC battle</strong><br />\nThe race for the top 15 men in the general classification began with Enric Mas (Movistar), who put in a solid time for fifth, 25:59.0.</p>\n<p>Down the mountain, meanwhile, the podium hopefuls and yellow jersey Tadej Pogaƒçar had begun their rides, with world time trial champion Remco Evenepoel going through the first checkpoint quicker than the rest on his time trial bike with climb-friendly road wheels.</p>\n<p>That time stood for a few minutes, at least, with Pogaƒçar flying through on his aero-modified road bike five seconds up on the Belgian and three more up on Vingegaard, who was racing on a time trial bike like Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Back up at the summit, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease A Bike) came closest to unseating Plapp with a time of 25:03.01, while Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) was 20 seconds slower.</p>\n<p>Plapp&#8217;s time in the hot seat, numbering over three hours, finally came to an end when Rogliƒç came through, going 28 seconds faster with a time of 24:20.97.</p>\n<p>As Pogaƒçar worked his way up the mountain, Vingegaard caught sight of Evenepoel in the final 500 metres ‚Äì getting out of the saddle and sprinting up the steep final 100 metres, Vingegaard flew past the Olympic time trial champion and set the fastest time, 44 seconds better than Rogliƒç at 23:36.88, the first man under the 24-minute barrier.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the maillot jaune appeared in the final stretch, dashing Vingegaard&#8217;s hopes of adding a stage win to his tally. Pogaƒçar, who was 23 seconds up on the Dane at the second checkpoint, only added more time on the way to the line, finishing with a time of 23:00.19 and his team&#8217;s 100th Grand Tour stage win in their history.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Cristian Rodr√≠guez (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) also did well, going sixth at 26:08.64.</p>\n<p><strong>The GC battle</strong><br />\nThe race for the top 15 men in the general classification began with Enric Mas (Movistar), who put in a solid time for fifth, 25:59.0.</p>\n<p>Down the mountain, meanwhile, the podium hopefuls and yellow jersey Tadej Pogaƒçar had begun their rides, with world time trial champion Remco Evenepoel going through the first checkpoint quicker than the rest on his time trial bike with climb-friendly road wheels.</p>\n<p>That time stood for a few minutes, at least, with Pogaƒçar flying through on his aero-modified road bike five seconds up on the Belgian and three more up on Vingegaard, who was racing on a time trial bike like Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Back up at the summit, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease A Bike) came closest to unseating Plapp with a time of 25:03.01, while Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) was 20 seconds slower.</p>\n<p>Plapp&#8217;s time in the hot seat, numbering over three hours, finally came to an end when Rogliƒç came through, going 28 seconds faster with a time of 24:20.97.</p>\n<p>As Pogaƒçar worked his way up the mountain, Vingegaard caught sight of Evenepoel in the final 500 metres ‚Äì getting out of the saddle and sprinting up the steep final 100 metres, Vingegaard flew past the Olympic time trial champion and set the fastest time, 44 seconds better than Rogliƒç at 23:36.88, the first man under the 24-minute barrier.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the maillot jaune appeared in the final stretch, dashing Vingegaard&#8217;s hopes of adding a stage win to his tally. Pogaƒçar, who was 23 seconds up on the Dane at the second checkpoint, only added more time on the way to the line, finishing with a time of 23:00.19 and his team&#8217;s 100th Grand Tour stage win in their history.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Also, Uno-X were fighting for their own GC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard day for everybody but in the end, we were super strong. We had this stage in mind for a long time, and we did it,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after the stage, before paying tribute to Samuele Privitera, who died at the Giro della Valle d‚ÄôAosta on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think this stage can go for Samuele and to all his family because it was really sad. It was the first thing I read in the morning, and I was thinking in the last kilometre about him and how tough this sport can be and how much pain it can cause.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar also thought back to the 2022 Tour, where Vingegaard beat him on Hautacam by 1:04 on the way to the overall win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI knew the first time I rode Hautacam, when I did recon, that it was a super nice climb. I was always looking forward to riding this climb and then it was in the 2022 Tour de France,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor the GC, I was trying with my head through the wall to get back the yellow jersey, but Jumbo was too strong back then. I almost already forgot about this. I was looking forward to today and then all the people were coming to me to say, ‚ÄòThis is the revenge time, blah blah blah‚Äô.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen, when we approached the bottom of the climb, it was just the reverse story of a few years ago, one Belgian on the front and our team on the front. Really, I‚Äôm super happy to take time and to win on this climb.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was the best of the rest, finishing 13 seconds further back. Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) and Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) were next across the line, three minutes down.</p>\n<p>White jersey Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) finished seventh behind K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) at 3:35, a creditable result after he was initially dropped 54km from the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Former race leader Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) dropped from the GC favourites group with over 50km from the line. Having lost ground on the day‚Äôs first hard climb, the Col du Soulor, the Irishman would lose 13:38 at the finish.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar is now back in yellow for the third time this July, already holding a commanding lead of 3:31 over Vingegaard. Evenepoel remains in third overall at 4:45 down, while Lipowitz is fourth at 5:34, six seconds up on Vauquelin.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 12 of the Tour de France marked the race‚Äôs first visit to the high mountains this year, racing from Auch into the Pyrenees with a 180.6km stage heading to the hors categori√© summit finish of Hautacam (13.5km at 7.8%).</p>\n<p>Along the way, the riders would tackle a largely-flat opening 122km, featuring just a single fourth-category ascent of the C√¥te de Labatmale (1.3km at 6.3%), before hitting the first-category Col du Soulor (11.8km at 7.3%) and the second-category Col des Bord√®res (3.1km at 7.7%) on the way to Hautacam to round of 3,913 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>The battle for the day‚Äôs breakaway was a fierce one, though not overly long. Stage 11 winner Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) kicked off the action, while green jersey contenders Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) were among the early attackers.</p>\n<p>The breakaway fight was settled after 16km of racing, with a massive 51 riders splitting off the front of the peloton. Picnic-PostNL were the only team to miss out on the move, while other teams had multiple riders out front, including Ineos Grenadiers with five and Tudor and Cofidis with four.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was back on the attack, while several GC helpers including Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike), and Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) got into the group, as did Ineos Grenadiers leader Carlos Rodr√≠guez, who lay within six minutes of the race lead.</p>\n<p>Joining them were a host of strong climbers, including Santiago Buitrago, Lenny Martinez (both Bahrain Victorious), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ), Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling), Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Jayco-AlUla), Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Einer Rubio, Pablo Castrillo (Movistar), Emanuel Buchmann (Cofidis), and Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers, Bahrain Victorious, Groupama-FDJ, and Jayco-AlUla drove the break, while back in the peloton EF Education-EasyPost and UAE Team Emirates-XRG pulled in the peloton.</p>\n<p>With the GC men keeping an eye on Rodr√≠guez and hoping to contest the stage win amongst themselves, the breakaway was kept on a tight leash of just two minutes on the run to the mountains.</p>\n<p>Before the ascent of the Soulor began, Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious) led the break over the C√¥te de Labatmale, while Laurez Rex (Intermarch√©-Wanty) took the maximum 20 points to Van der Poel‚Äôs 17 at the day‚Äôs intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>The early slopes of the Soulor threw up a few surprises in the breakaway as several of the stronger climbers dropped back from the move, with Buchmann, Martin, and mountain classification leader Martinez all going backwards.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike paced the peloton up the climb lined out in front of Vingegaard, with their pace proving too much for Evenepoel. The Belgian went out the back 8km from the top, a full 54km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards, the yellow jersey of Ben Healy was also in trouble, losing ground on the GC group. Up in the breakaway it was Woods pushing on with Skjelmose, Storer, and Rubio leading the chase behind along with Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>Over the top, the main GC group lay two minutes away from Woods, while Evenepoel, having passed Healy, lay a further minute back. The maillot jaune, meanwhile, was overheating and almost five minutes from the front.</p>\n<p><strong>Final two climbs</strong><br />\nWoods was joined by Skjelmose and Armirail on the descent into the final 40km and onto the Col des Bord√®res, with the Frenchman going solo at the front on the climb itself. At the top, he‚Äôd pulled out 50 seconds on a chase group including Skjelmose, Storer, Woods, and Rubio.</p>\n<p>Still two minutes down the mountain, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) shared pacing duties for their teams, with Jonas Vingegaard, Sepp Kuss, Pogaƒçar, and Jonatan Narv√°ez also up there.</p>\n<p>Joining them were Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Evenepoel worked hard to keep in touch with his GC rivals, doing a stellar job to crest the top just 20 seconds down a full 24km after he was dropped.</p>\n<p>The long, stop-start descent into the valley and to the base of the day‚Äôs final climb followed, with Pogaƒçar gaining a reinforcement as Wellens waited for the GC group. The group gained several more riders shortly afterwards, including Evenepoel, who got back on with 27km to go. Simon Yates was another notable name to make it back.</p>\n<p>In the lead, Armirail was flying, pulling out two minutes as Skjelmose, Storer, Woods, and Rubio dropped back towards the GC men. The quartet were caught before the start of the final ascent, leaving the enlarged group chasing the solo leader.</p>\n<p>Wellens led the way onto Hautacam with Narv√°ez, Yates, and Pogaƒçar next in line, the UAE train immediately cutting 30 seconds from Armirail‚Äôs lead as riders dropped from the rear ‚Äì including Kuss, Simon Yates, and, once again, Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Now 12km from the top, both Wellens and Adam Yates were done, leaving Narv√°ez to lead out a shockingly-early Pogaƒçar attack. Vingegaard had no answer to the sprint, while the last few hangers-on ‚Äì Onley, Lipowitz, Rogliƒç, Johannessen, Gall ‚Äì had already been left behind by Narv√°ez‚Äôs acceleration.</p>\n<p>At 11km, Pogaƒçar passed Armirail, while Vingegaard chased 10 seconds down. Rogliƒç‚Äôs group lay almost a minute back, while Evenepoel chased at 1:15.</p>\n<p>From there, the seconds only totted up as Pogaƒçar rode away to a dominating victory. At 9km, those same gaps lay at 30 seconds, 1:10 and 1:25, while at 7km to go, Vingegaard lay 50 seconds back with Evenepoel at two minutes.</p>\n<p>At 5km to go, the group of dropped GC men between Vinegegaard and Evenepoel split as Lipowitz and Onley jumped away from Rogliƒç and Johannessen. The Austrian looked the strongest of the quartet, pushing on alone at 4km to go with Onley trailing.</p>\n<p>Up front, Pogaƒçar was well on the way to his 20th Tour stage win, 1:30 up on Vingegaard at the 3km marker, a further 50 seconds on Lipowitz, and three minutes on Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>By the finish, he‚Äôd have plenty of time to celebrate, crossing the flamme rouge 1:50 up on his main rival and with the 2025 Tour de France already in his hands. Vingegaard, noticeably flagging in contrast to Pogaƒçar‚Äôs fresh look, eventually came home at 2:10 down, his Tour de France bid possibly over on the race‚Äôs first visit to the high mountains.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=12&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=12&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The maillot jaune, meanwhile, was overheating and almost five minutes from the front.</p>\n<p><strong>Final two climbs</strong><br />\nWoods was joined by Skjelmose and Armirail on the descent into the final 40km and onto the Col des Bord√®res, with the Frenchman going solo at the front on the climb itself. At the top, he‚Äôd pulled out 50 seconds on a chase group including Skjelmose, Storer, Woods, and Rubio.</p>\n<p>Still two minutes down the mountain, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) shared pacing duties for their teams, with Jonas Vingegaard, Sepp Kuss, Pogaƒçar, and Jonatan Narv√°ez also up there.</p>\n<p>Joining them were Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>Evenepoel worked hard to keep in touch with his GC rivals, doing a stellar job to crest the top just 20 seconds down a full 24km after he was dropped.</p>\n<p>The long, stop-start descent into the valley and to the base of the day‚Äôs final climb followed, with Pogaƒçar gaining a reinforcement as Wellens waited for the GC group. The group gained several more riders shortly afterwards, including Evenepoel, who got back on with 27km to go. Simon Yates was another notable name to make it back.</p>\n<p>In the lead, Armirail was flying, pulling out two minutes as Skjelmose, Storer, Woods, and Rubio dropped back towards the GC men. The quartet were caught before the start of the final ascent, leaving the enlarged group chasing the solo leader.</p>\n<p>Wellens led the way onto Hautacam with Narv√°ez, Yates, and Pogaƒçar next in line, the UAE train immediately cutting 30 seconds from Armirail‚Äôs lead as riders dropped from the rear ‚Äì including Kuss, Simon Yates, and, once again, Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Now 12km from the top, both Wellens and Adam Yates were done, leaving Narv√°ez to lead out a shockingly-early Pogaƒçar attack. Vingegaard had no answer to the sprint, while the last few hangers-on ‚Äì Onley, Lipowitz, Rogliƒç, Johannessen, Gall ‚Äì had already been left behind by Narv√°ez‚Äôs acceleration.</p>\n<p>At 11km, Pogaƒçar passed Armirail, while Vingegaard chased 10 seconds down. Rogliƒç‚Äôs group lay almost a minute back, while Evenepoel chased at 1:15.</p>\n<p>From there, the seconds only totted up as Pogaƒçar rode away to a dominating victory. At 9km, those same gaps lay at 30 seconds, 1:10 and 1:25, while at 7km to go, Vingegaard lay 50 seconds back with Evenepoel at two minutes.</p>\n<p>At 5km to go, the group of dropped GC men between Vinegegaard and Evenepoel split as Lipowitz and Onley jumped away from Rogliƒç and Johannessen. The Austrian looked the strongest of the quartet, pushing on alone at 4km to go with Onley trailing.</p>\n<p>Up front, Pogaƒçar was well on the way to his 20th Tour stage win, 1:30 up on Vingegaard at the 3km marker, a further 50 seconds on Lipowitz, and three minutes on Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>By the finish, he‚Äôd have plenty of time to celebrate, crossing the flamme rouge 1:50 up on his main rival and with the 2025 Tour de France already in his hands.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) stamped his authority on the Tour de France as the race visited the high mountains for the first time, attacking 12km from the top of Hautacam to score a dominant solo stage 12 victory.</p>\n<p>The World Champion, still sporting bandages following his late stage 11 crash, employed a Classics-style lead-out on the early slopes of the hors categori√© mountain, with Tim Wellens giving way to Jhonatan Narv√°ez, who sprinted uphill to launch the reigning champion.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) had no answer to the move, while everybody else in the GC group had already been dropped by Narv√°ez. It was all about limiting losses for the Dane as the seconds ticked away.</p>\n<p>After managing to hold the time gap to 10 seconds initially, Vingegaard‚Äôs deficit ballooned out to a minute with 6km still to run, with the seconds only piling on from there. By the time the pair had crossed the line, 2:10 separated them, leaving Pogaƒçar firmly in charge of the Tour‚Äôs general classification.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe did superb job. The team rode really well. Chapeau also to Ben Healy and EF. They were trying to defend the jersey, and they showed a really big spirit. Also, Uno-X were fighting for their own GC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard day for everybody but in the end, we were super strong. We had this stage in mind for a long time, and we did it,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after the stage, before paying tribute to Samuele Privitera, who died at the Giro della Valle d‚ÄôAosta on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think this stage can go for Samuele and to all his family because it was really sad. It was the first thing I read in the morning, and I was thinking in the last kilometre about him and how tough this sport can be and how much pain it can cause.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar also thought back to the 2022 Tour, where Vingegaard beat him on Hautacam by 1:04 on the way to the overall win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI knew the first time I rode Hautacam, when I did recon, that it was a super nice climb. I was always looking forward to riding this climb and then it was in the 2022 Tour de France,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor the GC, I was trying with my head through the wall to get back the yellow jersey, but Jumbo was too strong back then. I almost already forgot about this. I was looking forward to today and then all the people were coming to me to say, ‚ÄòThis is the revenge time, blah blah blah‚Äô.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen, when we approached the bottom of the climb, it was just the reverse story of a few years ago, one Belgian on the front and our team on the front. Really, I‚Äôm super happy to take time and to win on this climb.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was the best of the rest, finishing 13 seconds further back. Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) and Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) were next across the line, three minutes down.</p>\n<p>White jersey Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) finished seventh behind K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) at 3:35, a creditable result after he was initially dropped 54km from the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Former race leader Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) dropped from the GC favourites group with over 50km from the line. Having lost ground on the day‚Äôs first hard climb, the Col du Soulor, the Irishman would lose 13:38 at the finish.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar is now back in yellow for the third time this July, already holding a commanding lead of 3:31 over Vingegaard. Evenepoel remains in third overall at 4:45 down, while Lipowitz is fourth at 5:34, six seconds up on Vauquelin.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 12 of the Tour de France marked the race‚Äôs first visit to the high mountains this year, racing from Auch into the Pyrenees with a 180.6km stage heading to the hors categori√© summit finish of Hautacam (13.5km at 7.8%).</p>\n<p>Along the way, the riders would tackle a largely-flat opening 122km, featuring just a single fourth-category ascent of the C√¥te de Labatmale (1.3km at 6.3%), before hitting the first-category Col du Soulor (11.8km at 7.3%) and the second-category Col des Bord√®res (3.1km at 7.7%) on the way to Hautacam to round of 3,913 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>The battle for the day‚Äôs breakaway was a fierce one, though not overly long. Stage 11 winner Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) kicked off the action, while green jersey contenders Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) were among the early attackers.</p>\n<p>The breakaway fight was settled after 16km of racing, with a massive 51 riders splitting off the front of the peloton. Picnic-PostNL were the only team to miss out on the move, while other teams had multiple riders out front, including Ineos Grenadiers with five and Tudor and Cofidis with four.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was back on the attack, while several GC helpers including Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike), and Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) got into the group, as did Ineos Grenadiers leader Carlos Rodr√≠guez, who lay within six minutes of the race lead.</p>\n<p>Joining them were a host of strong climbers, including Santiago Buitrago, Lenny Martinez (both Bahrain Victorious), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ), Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling), Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Jayco-AlUla), Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Einer Rubio, Pablo Castrillo (Movistar), Emanuel Buchmann (Cofidis), and Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers, Bahrain Victorious, Groupama-FDJ, and Jayco-AlUla drove the break, while back in the peloton EF Education-EasyPost and UAE Team Emirates-XRG pulled in the peloton.</p>\n<p>With the GC men keeping an eye on Rodr√≠guez and hoping to contest the stage win amongst themselves, the breakaway was kept on a tight leash of just two minutes on the run to the mountains.</p>\n<p>Before the ascent of the Soulor began, Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious) led the break over the C√¥te de Labatmale, while Laurez Rex (Intermarch√©-Wanty) took the maximum 20 points to Van der Poel‚Äôs 17 at the day‚Äôs intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>The early slopes of the Soulor threw up a few surprises in the breakaway as several of the stronger climbers dropped back from the move, with Buchmann, Martin, and mountain classification leader Martinez all going backwards.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike paced the peloton up the climb lined out in front of Vingegaard, with their pace proving too much for Evenepoel. The Belgian went out the back 8km from the top, a full 54km from the finish line.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards, the yellow jersey of Ben Healy was also in trouble, losing ground on the GC group. Up in the breakaway it was Woods pushing on with Skjelmose, Storer, and Rubio leading the chase behind along with Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>Over the top, the main GC group lay two minutes away from Woods, while Evenepoel, having passed Healy, lay a further minute back.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) completed an amazing comeback from a broken collarbone suffered under a month ago at the Baloise Belgium Tour, winning stage 11 of the Tour de France from the day-long breakaway in Toulouse.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian, who was one of the most combative riders last July, outpaced Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) to the finish as the pair dodged a protestor on the line, while metres behind, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) fell just short of catching the pair with a solo 9km chase.</p>\n<p>Abrahamsen and Schmid had been part of a five-man move which went clear right at the start of the 156.8km stage, holding strong all stage long despite wave after wave of attack flowing from the peloton for over half the day.</p>\n<p>After going clear of breakmates Davide Ballerini (XDS-Astana), Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious) and Mathieu Burgaudeau (TotalEnergies) on the steep slopes of the day‚Äôs final climb, the C√¥te de Pech David, the pair rode on to the finish as Van der Poel attacked from a strong chase group including Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>The Dutchman, already a stage winner on day two of the Tour, fell seven seconds short of making the catch, leaving Abrahamsen and Uno-X Mobility, racing their second Tour de France, celebrating their first stage victory at the race.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI broke my collarbone four weeks ago in the Belgium Tour. I was crying in the hospital because I thought I wasn‚Äôt riding the Tour de France,‚Äù Abrahamsen said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe day after I was on the home trainer and hoping I could go to the Tour. Every day, I did everything I could to come back. So, to be here having won a stage of the Tour de France is amazing.</p>\n<p>‚Äú[Schmid] was so strong today from the start. I tried and it was so difficult to pass him, but I was thinking ‚ÄòI have to win this stage, I have to‚Äô, and then I got a wheel in front and that was so nice.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI knew I had a pretty good sprint, and we had been out for a long time. From km0 I was sprinting after the car. So, I had to be smart and not go over the limit. In the end, I was hoping to take him in the sprint. We were with very strong guys but never with more than two-and-a-half minutes, I think. We worked so hard to get the gap all day and it‚Äôs so nice to get the victory now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The drama in the final wasn‚Äôt confined to the breakaway battle, either, with a GC skirmish on the C√¥te de Pech David giving way to panic for race favourite Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) as he crashed with 4.1km to run.</p>\n<p>The World Champion was part of a select group that had gone clear from the peloton over the top of the hill, and while attacks from Visma-Lease a Bike pair Matteo Jorgenson and Jonas Vingegaard didn‚Äôt throw him off, unfortunately he was left with nowhere to go when Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) cut across his front wheel.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar hit the ground and slid towards some road furniture, but he was up and quickly back on his bike, joining a chase group as Jhonatan Narv√°ez and Adam Yates helped pace him back.</p>\n<p>In a show of sportsmanship, the GC group slowed up to let Pogaƒçar back in, saving him any time loss with the Slovenian now just having to worry about tending to any cuts and grazes ahead of the Thursday‚Äôs stage 12 race to the Pyrenees.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a day off for the Tour‚Äôs first rest day, the race resumed on Wednesday for stage 11, a Classics-style, 156.8km race in the hills around Toulouse. The day featured five classified climbs, all fourth category aside from the finale, with 1,600 vertical metres along the way. After 25.9km came the C√¥te de Castelnau-d‚ÄôEstr√©tefonds (1.4km at 6.6%), but much of the day‚Äôs climbing came late on the stage.</p>\n<p>At 111.6km came the C√¥te de Montgiscard (1.6km at 5.3%), with the C√¥te de Corrosnac (900m at 6.7%) 5.4km later with a series of smaller, uncategorised climbs to follow. The final two challenges, at 14.3km and 8.8km from the finish, respectively, came with the C√¥te de Vielle-Toulouse (1.3km at 6.8%) and the sprinter-challenging C√¥te de Pech David (800m at 12.4%).</p>\n<p>Once the flag dropped, Jonas Abrahamsen, jumped out of the peloton to launch the day‚Äôs breakaway.

I was crying in the hospital because I thought I wasn‚Äôt riding the Tour de France,‚Äù Abrahamsen said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe day after I was on the home trainer and hoping I could go to the Tour.

We worked so hard to get the gap all day and it‚Äôs so nice to get the victory now.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The drama in the final wasn‚Äôt confined to the breakaway battle, either, with a GC skirmish on the C√¥te de Pech David giving way to panic for race favourite Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) as he crashed with 4.1km to run.</p>\n<p>The World Champion was part of a select group that had gone clear from the peloton over the top of the hill, and while attacks from Visma-Lease a Bike pair Matteo Jorgenson and Jonas Vingegaard didn‚Äôt throw him off, unfortunately he was left with nowhere to go when Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) cut across his front wheel.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar hit the ground and slid towards some road furniture, but he was up and quickly back on his bike, joining a chase group as Jhonatan Narv√°ez and Adam Yates helped pace him back.</p>\n<p>In a show of sportsmanship, the GC group slowed up to let Pogaƒçar back in, saving him any time loss with the Slovenian now just having to worry about tending to any cuts and grazes ahead of the Thursday‚Äôs stage 12 race to the Pyrenees.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a day off for the Tour‚Äôs first rest day, the race resumed on Wednesday for stage 11, a Classics-style, 156.8km race in the hills around Toulouse. The day featured five classified climbs, all fourth category aside from the finale, with 1,600 vertical metres along the way. After 25.9km came the C√¥te de Castelnau-d‚ÄôEstr√©tefonds (1.4km at 6.6%), but much of the day‚Äôs climbing came late on the stage.</p>\n<p>At 111.6km came the C√¥te de Montgiscard (1.6km at 5.3%), with the C√¥te de Corrosnac (900m at 6.7%) 5.4km later with a series of smaller, uncategorised climbs to follow. The final two challenges, at 14.3km and 8.8km from the finish, respectively, came with the C√¥te de Vielle-Toulouse (1.3km at 6.8%) and the sprinter-challenging C√¥te de Pech David (800m at 12.4%).</p>\n<p>Once the flag dropped, Jonas Abrahamsen, jumped out of the peloton to launch the day‚Äôs breakaway.

Then I just did my best from there really.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time [six years since Yates&#8217; last Tour victory &#8211; Ed.], but also I wasn&#8217;t actually expecting any opportunities here. Of course we came here fully focused on Jonas and the GC, but the stage played out in a way that I could be there for the stage [win], and I took it with both hands.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 10 started in the sunshine in Ennezat and, being such a key stage, there was a big fight for the breakaway, with several moves and riders going away early and being reeled straight back in. After around 10km, a large group broke off the front of the peloton, made up of over 20 riders, with more bridging across to grow to 28 after 20km.</p>\n<p>In the break was: Campenaerts, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre, Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep), Healy, Baudin, Powless, Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost), Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers), Simmons (Lidl-Trek), Pacher (Groupama-FDJ), Alaphilippe, Storer (Tudor), O&#8217;Connor, Plapp, Schmid (Jayco AlUla), Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Romeo (Movistar), Armirail, Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Champoussin, Velasco (XDS Astana), Cras (TotalEnergies), Woods, Blackmore, Lutsenko (Israel-Premier Tech), and Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility). Frank van den Broek (Picnic PostNL) was in the group for a while, but was dropped.</p>\n<p>Both Visma and Soudal-QuickStep had riders in the break, but UAE did not, and they also had some issues with Pavel Sivakov dropping early on. The peloton wasn&#8217;t fully happy with this group, and the gap only grew out very slowly, at just a minute at 30km of racing, and riders still attempting to bridge. Meanwhile, behind, many riders ‚Äì up to half of the race ‚Äì were already dropped, many in a group not far back from the GC group, and the sprinters already three minutes down after 30km of racing.</p>\n<p>Up front, Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) successfully joined the leaders, making it 29 ahead with two from the Spanish team. However, it seemed the large break itself wasn&#8217;t fully cooperating either, as soon after, a small group of riders split off the front of the group, pushed on by Sweeny and O&#8217;Connor. However, that did come back together, and the gap grew out to over two minutes with 50km completed.</p>\n<p>On the first two climbs, Lenny Martinez won the maximum KOM points, putting him into the virtual lead of the classification and laying out his intentions for the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakaway builds their advantage</strong><br />\nAfter the first 60km, the climbing started ramping up even more, with six categorised climbs still to come in the final 100km. However, UAE Team Emirates-XRG were still keen to keep the break close, and for a long time it was held at under two minutes.</p>\n<p>On the C√¥te de Charade, Ben O&#8217;Connor went on the attack and was 30 seconds ahead for a while, but attacks towards the top brought him back in, as Lenny Martinez swept up some more mountain points, and a group of 10 split off from the break. The aggression in the break saw the gap grow to three and a half minutes for the first time.</p>\n<p>The 10 up front were Martinez, O&#8217;Connor, Campenaerts, Yates, Valentin Paret-Peintre, Healy, Baudin, Arensman, Simmons and Woods, though that soon became 18 as Sweeney, Pacher, Plapp, Castrillo, Garc√≠a Pierna, Storer, Johannessen and Blackmore found their way back to the front with 88km to go. At the top of the next climb, Martinez took maximum points once again, and the break continued their advantage, only losing Plapp along the way.</p>\n<p>With 70km to go, the gap was up to four minutes, and all the dropped breakaway riders had been caught. As the gap ticked over four minutes, Healy went into the virtual yellow jersey, with EF doing much of the work in the break. Perhaps surprisingly, UAE weren&#8217;t happy to just let it go, and were burning through riders behind to try and control the gap.</p>\n<p><strong>An attacking finale and new yellow jersey</strong><br />\nWith 50km to go, UAE had only a few riders left on the front of the peloton in front of Pogaƒçar, whilst up front riders began to drop from the break, who had a gap of five minutes. On the next climb, the Col de la Croix Morand, Ben Healy tried to attack at the base but didn&#8217;t get anywhere.</p>\n<p>With 35km to go, the gap was approaching six minutes, as it began to look like the leaders would be contesting the win, despite UAE&#8217;s best efforts to limit things, and the attacks began, though nothing stuck for a while.</p>\n<p>With 26km to go, Simmons put in a big dig, and drew out a group of six, with Healy, Storer, O&#8217;Connor, Yates and Arensman. Back in the peloton, Visma sensed some weakness in UAE and started pacing on an uncategorised climb, with Sepp Kuss briefly chipping off the front and forcing UAE to close the gap. It was then Matteo Jorgenson&#8217;s turn to accelerate, with Pogaƒçar himself closing that gap, with Vingegaard stuck to his wheel.</p>\n<p>In front, Healy was not getting a huge amount of cooperation from his fellow leaders but was still pushing on in pursuit of a stage victory. After attacking all day, Simmons was the first of the leaders to crack, dropping with 14km to go. Onto the official next climb, the Col de la Croix Saint-Robert, things briefly calmed, but it wasn&#8217;t long until the UAE-Visma hostilities resumed.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the penultimate climb, Visma-Lease a Bike were leading the peloton, with Pogaƒçar having closed down several gaps himself. With 7km and the Mont-Dore to go, the leaders had five and a half minutes over the yellow jersey group, as a final climb battle looked to be brewing.</p>\n<p>With 3.5km to go, on the base of the Mont-Dore, Yates put in his attack, initially followed by O&#8217;Connor, but the Brit slowly rode the Australian off his wheel and O&#8217;Connor fell away with 2km to go. It was then Arensman who was chasing, and he looked to be coming close, but it wasn&#8217;t quite enough, and Yates soloed to victory.</p>\n<p>Arensman and Healy came home in second and third, and then there was a long wait as the GC group hit the climb five minutes down the road. Visma led things up the climb, with Pogaƒçar isolated, and it was Evenepoel who put in a first attack but was quickly brought back.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar then attacked before the final kilometre, with Vingegaard able to follow, and once it became clear that Vingegeaard was neither going to work with him nor attack him, the pair slowed up and rode to the finish together. They grasped hands as they crossed the line, but ultimately took just six seconds on a group containing Evenepoel, Onley and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Meanwhile, behind, many riders ‚Äì up to half of the race ‚Äì were already dropped, many in a group not far back from the GC group, and the sprinters already three minutes down after 30km of racing.</p>\n<p>Up front, Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) successfully joined the leaders, making it 29 ahead with two from the Spanish team. However, it seemed the large break itself wasn&#8217;t fully cooperating either, as soon after, a small group of riders split off the front of the group, pushed on by Sweeny and O&#8217;Connor. However, that did come back together, and the gap grew out to over two minutes with 50km completed.</p>\n<p>On the first two climbs, Lenny Martinez won the maximum KOM points, putting him into the virtual lead of the classification and laying out his intentions for the day.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakaway builds their advantage</strong><br />\nAfter the first 60km, the climbing started ramping up even more, with six categorised climbs still to come in the final 100km. However, UAE Team Emirates-XRG were still keen to keep the break close, and for a long time it was held at under two minutes.</p>\n<p>On the C√¥te de Charade, Ben O&#8217;Connor went on the attack and was 30 seconds ahead for a while, but attacks towards the top brought him back in, as Lenny Martinez swept up some more mountain points, and a group of 10 split off from the break. The aggression in the break saw the gap grow to three and a half minutes for the first time.</p>\n<p>The 10 up front were Martinez, O&#8217;Connor, Campenaerts, Yates, Valentin Paret-Peintre, Healy, Baudin, Arensman, Simmons and Woods, though that soon became 18 as Sweeney, Pacher, Plapp, Castrillo, Garc√≠a Pierna, Storer, Johannessen and Blackmore found their way back to the front with 88km to go. At the top of the next climb, Martinez took maximum points once again, and the break continued their advantage, only losing Plapp along the way.</p>\n<p>With 70km to go, the gap was up to four minutes, and all the dropped breakaway riders had been caught. As the gap ticked over four minutes, Healy went into the virtual yellow jersey, with EF doing much of the work in the break. Perhaps surprisingly, UAE weren&#8217;t happy to just let it go, and were burning through riders behind to try and control the gap.</p>\n<p><strong>An attacking finale and new yellow jersey</strong><br />\nWith 50km to go, UAE had only a few riders left on the front of the peloton in front of Pogaƒçar, whilst up front riders began to drop from the break, who had a gap of five minutes. On the next climb, the Col de la Croix Morand, Ben Healy tried to attack at the base but didn&#8217;t get anywhere.</p>\n<p>With 35km to go, the gap was approaching six minutes, as it began to look like the leaders would be contesting the win, despite UAE&#8217;s best efforts to limit things, and the attacks began, though nothing stuck for a while.</p>\n<p>With 26km to go, Simmons put in a big dig, and drew out a group of six, with Healy, Storer, O&#8217;Connor, Yates and Arensman. Back in the peloton, Visma sensed some weakness in UAE and started pacing on an uncategorised climb, with Sepp Kuss briefly chipping off the front and forcing UAE to close the gap. It was then Matteo Jorgenson&#8217;s turn to accelerate, with Pogaƒçar himself closing that gap, with Vingegaard stuck to his wheel.</p>\n<p>In front, Healy was not getting a huge amount of cooperation from his fellow leaders but was still pushing on in pursuit of a stage victory. After attacking all day, Simmons was the first of the leaders to crack, dropping with 14km to go. Onto the official next climb, the Col de la Croix Saint-Robert, things briefly calmed, but it wasn&#8217;t long until the UAE-Visma hostilities resumed.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the penultimate climb, Visma-Lease a Bike were leading the peloton, with Pogaƒçar having closed down several gaps himself. With 7km and the Mont-Dore to go, the leaders had five and a half minutes over the yellow jersey group, as a final climb battle looked to be brewing.</p>\n<p>With 3.5km to go, on the base of the Mont-Dore, Yates put in his attack, initially followed by O&#8217;Connor, but the Brit slowly rode the Australian off his wheel and O&#8217;Connor fell away with 2km to go. It was then Arensman who was chasing, and he looked to be coming close, but it wasn&#8217;t quite enough, and Yates soloed to victory.</p>\n<p>Arensman and Healy came home in second and third, and then there was a long wait as the GC group hit the climb five minutes down the road. Visma led things up the climb, with Pogaƒçar isolated, and it was Evenepoel who put in a first attack but was quickly brought back.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar then attacked before the final kilometre, with Vingegaard able to follow, and once it became clear that Vingegeaard was neither going to work with him nor attack him, the pair slowed up and rode to the finish together. They grasped hands as they crossed the line, but ultimately took just six seconds on a group containing Evenepoel, Onley and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) denied Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) a weekend sprint double at the Tour de France, coming from behind the Italian to score his own second win of the race on stage 9 to Ch√¢teauroux.</p>\n<p>The European Champion prevailed at the end of a messy, chaotic, and short-lived sprint, only set up in the final 700 metres after day-long breakaway survivor Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was caught within sight of the line.</p>\n<p>Merlier and Milan went head-to-head in the final metres of the 174.1km stage, with Merlier‚Äôs aerodynamic advantage perhaps making the difference in the dash for the line. Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) rounded out the podium in third place for his best result of the Tour so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really hot but in the bunch it was quite OK all day. They tried for echelons in the last 60km so we had no drinks anymore so I was a bit overheated. It was a quite OK day but really nervous,&#8221; Merlier said at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Five-and-a-half minutes is a lot, so we tried to help. Other teams also started to help. The pace was quite high, and in the front also. Like I said, it was hard for the guys at the front and the guys who were pulling. The bunch was just nervous.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Team leader Remco Evenepoel] was really strong. Normally, I aim to help him, but when it&#8217;s tailwind, he doesn&#8217;t feel his legs and he can move up easily. All the time when there was a possibility of echelons, me and Bert Van Lerberghe were also there to try to protect each other as much as possible, but thanks to Remco also, of course.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, me and Bert were together for the first time in the Tour. I was so much more confident with him in front of me. He did a really good job. One moment I thought I was boxed, but I came out and went all-in. I&#8217;m happy I can win my second stage here this year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) led the sprint once Van der Poel ‚Äì who had been out in the break for 173km with teammate Jonas Rickaert ‚Äì was caught. Upon launching the sprint, Milan found the space to race straight along the barriers, while Merlier and De Lie had to take the long way round, dodging the slower Van Poppel and Pascal Ackermann (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>The extra metres were clearly no hindrance, however, and at the 100-metre mark, Merlier and Milan were side-by-side. At that point, the momentum ‚Äì just ‚Äì was with the Belgian, who edged ahead in the final metres to score his 62nd career victory.</p>\n<p>Following stage 9, the main classifications at the Tour remain the same. Van der Poel drops one spot in the GC to sixth, while Milan has extended his green jersey lead with 227 points to the 156 of race leader Tadej Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe ninth stage of the Tour de France brought with it another day for the sprinters to round out the weekend. The flat 174.1km run from Chinon to Ch√¢teauroux featured no categorised climbs and only 1,000 metres of climbing, a day for a bunch sprint if ever there was one.</p>\n<p>The day‚Äôs intermediate sprint came after just 24.2km of racing, setting up the green jersey contenders with an early battle before the 150km run to the finish line.</p>\n<p>The sprinter‚Äôs plans were foiled at the drop of the flag to start the stage, however, when Alpecin-Deceuninck pair Mathieu van der Poel and Jonas Rickaert leapt away from the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>The duo would form the breakaway of the day, racing up the road as Lidl-Trek took control of the peloton for green jersey holder and stage 8 winner Milan. They‚Äôd build a five-minute gap before the sprint, which saw Van der Poel scoop up 20 points to Rickaert‚Äôs 17 as Milan led Biniam Girmay and Merlier across for 15, 13, and 12 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>The big news of the mid-stage was Jo√£o Almeida‚Äôs battle to continue in the race. The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider, a key lieutenant for Tadej Pogaƒçar, broke a rib in a crash on stage 7 but fought on through Saturday‚Äôs stage. However, with 120km to go he was off the back of the peloton and must‚Äôve clearly been in some pain as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p>Almeida made it just past the halfway point of the day before having to climb off the bike and abandon the race, leaving UAE Team Emirates-XRG down a vital rider in the battle against Visma-Lease A Bike later in the Tour.</p>\n<p>As was the case on stage 8, with not much beyond the intermediate sprint and the finish for any riders to fight over, there was no real action on the road to Ch√¢teauroux. At least on Sunday the average speed of the day touched 50 kph rather than languishing around the slowest predicted pace.</p>\n<p>Gradually, the two-man break‚Äôs maximum advantage of five minutes was whittled down. The time gap had fallen to four minutes at the 70km mark, hit three with 55km to go, and went under two around 15km later.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek continued their work on the front, keen to set up Milan for weekend clean sweep, and livening up the proceedings with a sharp burst on the front when crosswinds hit with 32km to run.</p>\n<p>The move saw a split in the peloton, even if no major sprinters or GC names were caught out. Five kilometres later, following Visma-Lease a Bike‚Äôs driving on the front, the gap to the leaders had come down to a minute, while those dropped in the echelons lay a further minute back.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel and Rickaert battled on out front towards the final kilometres of the day, retaining that minute advantage into the last 20km before that seconds ticked under just before the 10km mark.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel went solo at 6km to go, leaving the spent Rickaert to drop back to the peloton, leaving his team leader 30 seconds up the road. Behind him, Lidl-Trek were joined by a wide range of teams in the chase as the peloton strained to drag the Dutchman back.</p>\n<p>He sped on through the winding run-in to Ch√¢teauroux, but even Van der Poel‚Äôs power wasn‚Äôt enough to hold off a full charging peloton. That 30-second lead melted away, though not without a fight. He raced on under the flamme rouge before contact was made, a valiant effort cut 750 metres short of glory.</p>\n<p>The late catch led to a messy sprint without the longer set-up teams enjoy on other sprint days. Soudal-QuickStep and Israel-Premier Tech were among the teams on the front late on, with Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) leading it out to the line.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Milan and Merlier were lurking, ready to launch the sprint. They both took differing routes around other riders and towards the finish, and the pair battled side-by-side with the finish line in sight, but in the end it was Merlier who prevailed, pulling out that little bit of extra speed to take his team‚Äôs third win of the Tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

All the time when there was a possibility of echelons, me and Bert Van Lerberghe were also there to try to protect each other as much as possible, but thanks to Remco also, of course.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Finally, me and Bert were together for the first time in the Tour. I was so much more confident with him in front of me. He did a really good job. One moment I thought I was boxed, but I came out and went all-in. I&#8217;m happy I can win my second stage here this year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) led the sprint once Van der Poel ‚Äì who had been out in the break for 173km with teammate Jonas Rickaert ‚Äì was caught. Upon launching the sprint, Milan found the space to race straight along the barriers, while Merlier and De Lie had to take the long way round, dodging the slower Van Poppel and Pascal Ackermann (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>The extra metres were clearly no hindrance, however, and at the 100-metre mark, Merlier and Milan were side-by-side. At that point, the momentum ‚Äì just ‚Äì was with the Belgian, who edged ahead in the final metres to score his 62nd career victory.</p>\n<p>Following stage 9, the main classifications at the Tour remain the same. Van der Poel drops one spot in the GC to sixth, while Milan has extended his green jersey lead with 227 points to the 156 of race leader Tadej Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe ninth stage of the Tour de France brought with it another day for the sprinters to round out the weekend. The flat 174.1km run from Chinon to Ch√¢teauroux featured no categorised climbs and only 1,000 metres of climbing, a day for a bunch sprint if ever there was one.</p>\n<p>The day‚Äôs intermediate sprint came after just 24.2km of racing, setting up the green jersey contenders with an early battle before the 150km run to the finish line.</p>\n<p>The sprinter‚Äôs plans were foiled at the drop of the flag to start the stage, however, when Alpecin-Deceuninck pair Mathieu van der Poel and Jonas Rickaert leapt away from the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>The duo would form the breakaway of the day, racing up the road as Lidl-Trek took control of the peloton for green jersey holder and stage 8 winner Milan. They‚Äôd build a five-minute gap before the sprint, which saw Van der Poel scoop up 20 points to Rickaert‚Äôs 17 as Milan led Biniam Girmay and Merlier across for 15, 13, and 12 points, respectively.</p>\n<p>The big news of the mid-stage was Jo√£o Almeida‚Äôs battle to continue in the race. The UAE Team Emirates-XRG rider, a key lieutenant for Tadej Pogaƒçar, broke a rib in a crash on stage 7 but fought on through Saturday‚Äôs stage. However, with 120km to go he was off the back of the peloton and must‚Äôve clearly been in some pain as a result of his injury.</p>\n<p>Almeida made it just past the halfway point of the day before having to climb off the bike and abandon the race, leaving UAE Team Emirates-XRG down a vital rider in the battle against Visma-Lease A Bike later in the Tour.</p>\n<p>As was the case on stage 8, with not much beyond the intermediate sprint and the finish for any riders to fight over, there was no real action on the road to Ch√¢teauroux. At least on Sunday the average speed of the day touched 50 kph rather than languishing around the slowest predicted pace.</p>\n<p>Gradually, the two-man break‚Äôs maximum advantage of five minutes was whittled down. The time gap had fallen to four minutes at the 70km mark, hit three with 55km to go, and went under two around 15km later.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek continued their work on the front, keen to set up Milan for weekend clean sweep, and livening up the proceedings with a sharp burst on the front when crosswinds hit with 32km to run.</p>\n<p>The move saw a split in the peloton, even if no major sprinters or GC names were caught out. Five kilometres later, following Visma-Lease a Bike‚Äôs driving on the front, the gap to the leaders had come down to a minute, while those dropped in the echelons lay a further minute back.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel and Rickaert battled on out front towards the final kilometres of the day, retaining that minute advantage into the last 20km before that seconds ticked under just before the 10km mark.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel went solo at 6km to go, leaving the spent Rickaert to drop back to the peloton, leaving his team leader 30 seconds up the road. Behind him, Lidl-Trek were joined by a wide range of teams in the chase as the peloton strained to drag the Dutchman back.</p>\n<p>He sped on through the winding run-in to Ch√¢teauroux, but even Van der Poel‚Äôs power wasn‚Äôt enough to hold off a full charging peloton. That 30-second lead melted away, though not without a fight. He raced on under the flamme rouge before contact was made, a valiant effort cut 750 metres short of glory.</p>\n<p>The late catch led to a messy sprint without the longer set-up teams enjoy on other sprint days. Soudal-QuickStep and Israel-Premier Tech were among the teams on the front late on, with Danny van Poppel (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) leading it out to the line.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Milan and Merlier were lurking, ready to launch the sprint. They both took differing routes around other riders and towards the finish, and the pair battled side-by-side with the finish line in sight, but in the end it was Merlier who prevailed, pulling out that little bit of extra speed to take his team‚Äôs third win of the Tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>A pan-flat day at the Tour de France delivered the expected as Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) led the peloton home in a mass sprint to win stage 8 in Laval.</p>\n<p>The Italian Tour debutant powered to the front off the back of a Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) lead out to take his first stage win at the race and launch himself back into the green jersey points lead.</p>\n<p>Milan beat Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) at the end of a rising road to the finish at the end of the 171.4km stage. The Belgian was stuck in the wheel without the power to challenge, while behind the pair, Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) took third.</p>\n<p>The battle for the win ‚Äì and those precious 50 points towards the green jersey ‚Äì came at the end of a subdued four-hour stage which saw Intermarch√©-Wanty control for the most part, a brief burst of action at the intermediate sprint, with Milan once again the quickest, and a half-stage breakaway from two TotalEnergies riders.</p>\n<p>In the end, the day was always fated to end with the sprinters battling it out, and there would be no matching Milan‚Äôs pure power on the uphill run towards the line.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think I still don‚Äôt understand what we did. We came with some expectations and dreams to bring home. Then to predict it and bring them home are two different things,‚Äù Milan said after his win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was confident with the team. We were really close in the last stage, not in the first one, but in the third one we were pretty close but went a bit too early.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúToday we were really focussed and really believing in it. Our guys did an amazing job until the final. It was a really tough final and a bit stressful. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to drag up so much. I knew I had to wait as long as I could, but I like this kind of final. I‚Äôm really happy about the work we did; we really deserve it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Milan‚Äôs 23rd career victory now puts him in the driving seat for the points classification. He was already in the green jersey despite holding second behind race leader Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), but now, he has fully taken control at the top of the standings.</p>\n<p>He now tops the leaderboard with 192 points to Pogaƒçar‚Äôs 156. Defending points champion Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) lies third at 124 points.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winning with this jersey on the shoulders, it means a lot for me and also my country.

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) scorched to the stage victory and returned to the Tour de France overall lead on the summit of M√πr de Bretagne, clinching his second stage win in four days ahead of arch-rival Jonas Vingegard (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>Given a flawless lead-out by teammate Jhonatan Narv√°ez at the head of a group of eight stage leaders, Pogaƒçar stomped on the pedals 150 metres from the line to clinch the 101st win of his career.</p>\n<p>After a nasty crash with four kilometres to go saw top names like Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) fall heavily, UAE and Visma-Lease a Bike led the lead group of 20 riders onto the second ascent of the short but painfully steep M√ªr-de-Bretagne.</p>\n<p>Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) placed down a driving acceleration in the last kilometre, causing race leader Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to falter and fall back. Pogaƒçar, though was poised to pounce, with Vingegaard shadowing him closely but unable to come past at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy with the win today, we did it almost perfect. Unfortunately Jo√£o crashed, I hope he&#8217;s OK, if he is OK, it&#8217;s a perfect day, if he&#8217;s not OK, then this victory is for him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think me and Mathieu [van der Poel] both know this place very well, we have nice memories of it and we both wanted the same, to win on this iconic climb. But maybe he left out too much on the road yesterday [Thursday] so we couldn&#8217;t have a re-match.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But for me, the day went like we planned and the win is amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOn the rolling rural roads of central Brittany, Visma-Lease a Bike were once again very aggressive from the gun, with Victor Campenaerts and Wout van Aert, the latter also an early breakaway on stage 6, both early protagonists. Van Aert finally got clear with Swiss National Road Race and Time Trial Champion Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) in what looked like the most promising of the early moves. The first hour was raced at a searing average speed of 53.9 kph, and both the Belgian super-talent&#8217;s challenge and subsequent digs spearheaded by Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) all proved to be equally unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Finally the elastic snapped at 140 kilometres from the line and five riders went clear: 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers), racing his last ever three-week stage race, Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost), Marco Haller (Tudor), Ewen Costiou (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Ivan Garcia Cortina (Movistar).</p>\n<p>A counter-attack, spearheaded by Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) shortly afterwards, failed to work out and UAE&#8217;s Nils Politt and Marc Soler duly began operating a holding pattern on the front of the bunch.</p>\n<p>By the time the stage reached the birthplace of Bernard Hinault in Yffiniac, the gap remained stable at around 1:40 as the quintet ahead zoomed past giant effigies of the Breton giant of the sport. More and more, it seemed clear that any decisive action would be reduced to the three classified climbs of the stage, all situated in the last 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p>The breakaway tapped through the intermediate sprint of the day at the top of a slight climb, with Garc√≠a Cortina the sole rider to show interest in the move. Meanwhile, in the bunch US National Champion Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), aiming to limit potential inroads made by rivals of teammate Jonathan Milan in the points competition, powered ahead to claim sixth place behind the break of five.</p>\n<p>As so often happens in the Tour, the rise in speed at the sprint meant it doubled as the unofficial starting point for the stage finale, and the collaboration between the quintet ahead became notably more fluid and intense. It proved a two-edged weapon for Marco Haller, who sat up, clutching his thigh in pain, most likely with cramps. His difficulties also reduced the number of stage leaders to four and with less than a minute&#8217;s margin, it now looked very much as if the winner was going to come from the main bunch.</p>\n<p>Little by little, after a fraught start and very dull middle section, stage 7 began taking a more definitive shape. Various sprinters like Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Milan and Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), saved their energy for the two flat days on the weekend by sitting up while UAE Team Emirates-XRG notably increased their speed. Politt, having worked for the better part of two hours on the front, gave way to his teammate Soler, with Pavel Sivakov then taking over.</p>\n<p>On the first ascent of two of the M√ªr-de-Bretagne, though, Costiou went clear alone and Thomas was swept up one kilometre from the top. Costiou though was still ahead as he flashed across the finish line for the first time ahead of a front group of 25 or 30 riders, including all the main GC favourites, albeit with a dwindling advantage of just over 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>The narrative changed abruptly, though, as Van Aert set off in pursuit, losing his glasses on a corner of the sweeping descent but nonetheless ably leading Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious) and a strung-out bunch off the M√ªr-de-Bretagne at very high speed. 12 kilometres from the finish, Costiou was caught, unable to take what would have been a dream win for local team Ark√©a, but very much a key protagonist on home soil nonetheless, which always counts for something.</p>\n<p>The top GC teams were now an ever-increasing presence at the front of the mini-lead peloton, Visma and UAE jostling for position on the long, rolling run-in to the second, definitive ascent of the M√ªr. Vingegaard was in third position a lot of time, Pogaƒçar running around tenth, and Van der Poel still present, too, after struggling on the first time over the climb but there were plenty of other potential candidates for the stage.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, though, a crash at the back four kilometres from the line wreaked havoc in the rear end of the group and radically reduced its number, with Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla), Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG); Jack Haig and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) all hitting the deck hard.</p>\n<p>The front end of the mini-pack thundered on as Visma, still with Van Aert, were suddenly overtaken by a flying Tim Wellens with Pogaƒçar glued to his back wheel. As the road steepened to its maximum of 15%, Pogaƒçar tried to go from a distance, but Evenepoel and Vingegaard were quick to follow. As a result, for a few tantalizing seconds, the top three finishers of the 2024 Tour briefly emerged at the head of the field, but the chances of a three-way GC sprint fizzled out when Pogaƒçar visibly slowed and a group of half a dozen chasers regained contact.</p>\n<p>Amongst their number, Narv√°ez was to prove crucial to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s last efforts, particularly as Almeida, the rider Pogaƒçar usually relies on for uphill lead-outs, had crashed badly just before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Normally Jo√£o should be there, but then Johnny came through in the last kilometre and he did a super job,&#8221; Pogaƒçar recounted later, &#8220;keeping things under control until I came through.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When Pogaƒçar did accelerate around 200 metres from the line, try as he might he was unable to shake off Vingegaard, for all the World Champion&#8217;s dramatic hike in speed allowed the lead GC duo to gain a couple of seconds on their closest pursuers.</p>\n<p>Hitting speeds of 55kph at the top of the climb a 19th Tour de France stage victory beckoned for Pogaƒçar as well as the yellow and green jerseys. And while Almeida&#8217;s injuries are an important blow, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s grip on the 2025 Tour remains as firm as ever one week after the start in Lille.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The first hour was raced at a searing average speed of 53.9 kph, and both the Belgian super-talent&#8217;s challenge and subsequent digs spearheaded by Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) all proved to be equally unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>Finally the elastic snapped at 140 kilometres from the line and five riders went clear: 2018 Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers), racing his last ever three-week stage race, Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost), Marco Haller (Tudor), Ewen Costiou (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Ivan Garcia Cortina (Movistar).</p>\n<p>A counter-attack, spearheaded by Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) shortly afterwards, failed to work out and UAE&#8217;s Nils Politt and Marc Soler duly began operating a holding pattern on the front of the bunch.</p>\n<p>By the time the stage reached the birthplace of Bernard Hinault in Yffiniac, the gap remained stable at around 1:40 as the quintet ahead zoomed past giant effigies of the Breton giant of the sport. More and more, it seemed clear that any decisive action would be reduced to the three classified climbs of the stage, all situated in the last 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p>The breakaway tapped through the intermediate sprint of the day at the top of a slight climb, with Garc√≠a Cortina the sole rider to show interest in the move. Meanwhile, in the bunch US National Champion Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), aiming to limit potential inroads made by rivals of teammate Jonathan Milan in the points competition, powered ahead to claim sixth place behind the break of five.</p>\n<p>As so often happens in the Tour, the rise in speed at the sprint meant it doubled as the unofficial starting point for the stage finale, and the collaboration between the quintet ahead became notably more fluid and intense. It proved a two-edged weapon for Marco Haller, who sat up, clutching his thigh in pain, most likely with cramps. His difficulties also reduced the number of stage leaders to four and with less than a minute&#8217;s margin, it now looked very much as if the winner was going to come from the main bunch.</p>\n<p>Little by little, after a fraught start and very dull middle section, stage 7 began taking a more definitive shape. Various sprinters like Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Milan and Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), saved their energy for the two flat days on the weekend by sitting up while UAE Team Emirates-XRG notably increased their speed. Politt, having worked for the better part of two hours on the front, gave way to his teammate Soler, with Pavel Sivakov then taking over.</p>\n<p>On the first ascent of two of the M√ªr-de-Bretagne, though, Costiou went clear alone and Thomas was swept up one kilometre from the top. Costiou though was still ahead as he flashed across the finish line for the first time ahead of a front group of 25 or 30 riders, including all the main GC favourites, albeit with a dwindling advantage of just over 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>The narrative changed abruptly, though, as Van Aert set off in pursuit, losing his glasses on a corner of the sweeping descent but nonetheless ably leading Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious) and a strung-out bunch off the M√ªr-de-Bretagne at very high speed. 12 kilometres from the finish, Costiou was caught, unable to take what would have been a dream win for local team Ark√©a, but very much a key protagonist on home soil nonetheless, which always counts for something.</p>\n<p>The top GC teams were now an ever-increasing presence at the front of the mini-lead peloton, Visma and UAE jostling for position on the long, rolling run-in to the second, definitive ascent of the M√ªr. Vingegaard was in third position a lot of time, Pogaƒçar running around tenth, and Van der Poel still present, too, after struggling on the first time over the climb but there were plenty of other potential candidates for the stage.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, though, a crash at the back four kilometres from the line wreaked havoc in the rear end of the group and radically reduced its number, with Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla), Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG); Jack Haig and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) all hitting the deck hard.</p>\n<p>The front end of the mini-pack thundered on as Visma, still with Van Aert, were suddenly overtaken by a flying Tim Wellens with Pogaƒçar glued to his back wheel. As the road steepened to its maximum of 15%, Pogaƒçar tried to go from a distance, but Evenepoel and Vingegaard were quick to follow. As a result, for a few tantalizing seconds, the top three finishers of the 2024 Tour briefly emerged at the head of the field, but the chances of a three-way GC sprint fizzled out when Pogaƒçar visibly slowed and a group of half a dozen chasers regained contact.</p>\n<p>Amongst their number, Narv√°ez was to prove crucial to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s last efforts, particularly as Almeida, the rider Pogaƒçar usually relies on for uphill lead-outs, had crashed badly just before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Normally Jo√£o should be there, but then Johnny came through in the last kilometre and he did a super job,&#8221; Pogaƒçar recounted later, &#8220;keeping things under control until I came through.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When Pogaƒçar did accelerate around 200 metres from the line, try as he might he was unable to shake off Vingegaard, for all the World Champion&#8217;s dramatic hike in speed allowed the lead GC duo to gain a couple of seconds on their closest pursuers.</p>\n<p>Hitting speeds of 55kph at the top of the climb a 19th Tour de France stage victory beckoned for Pogaƒçar as well as the yellow and green jerseys. And while Almeida&#8217;s injuries are an important blow, Pogaƒçar&#8217;s grip on the 2025 Tour remains as firm as ever one week after the start in Lille.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Ireland&#8217;s Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) soloed to victory on stage 6 of the Tour de France, attacking out of the day-long breakaway with 42km to ride to his first Tour stage win, whilst Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) reclaimed yellow behind.</p>\n<p>Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) out-climbed Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) on the steep finale to take second, after the pair attacked to try to chase down Healy in the last 30km, but ultimately they were unable to catch the strong Irishman and the end of a long and aggressive day.</p>\n<p>Healy was the first rider to kick off the breakaway attempts at the start of stage 6, battling through a long, hard-fought break formation process that took over 60km and saw him caught and attacking again more than once.</p>\n<p>His perseverance eventually got him into the eight-man group that would be the day&#8217;s breakaway, and with 42km still to race, he attacked solo, never to be seen again and earning him the biggest win of his career.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just unbelievable. It&#8217;s really what I&#8217;ve worked all for ‚Äì not just this year, but the whole time. It&#8217;s really incredible, and hours and hours of hard work from so many people, so to pay them back today is really, really amazing,&#8221; Healy said at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year was a real eye-opener and really made me believe that I could do it [win a Tour stage]. I just knuckled down and did the hard work and tried to refine my racing style as well, lots of racing footage watched and it really paid off today I think.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just switched on from the start,&#8221; Healy said of the tough break formation. &#8220;Maybe I spent a a bit too much to get in the break but that&#8217;s just the way I do it. And then once we were in there, we really had to work for that gap and it was just on the pedals all day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I needed to get away from the group and pick my moment, and I think I timed it well and hopefully caught them by surprise a little bit. But I knew what I had to do: just head down and do my best ride to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Poel finished in the third group on the road, the last of the remaining breakaway riders, and despite a sprinting finish from Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates), the Dutchman managed to take back yellow by a single second and now leads the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>GC action almost kicked off on the final climb, with Visma-Lease a Bike trying to test Pogaƒçar, or perhaps shorten the gap and force the Slovenian to keep the jersey. But ultimately, though Pogaƒçar beat Vingegaard to the line, he did lose yellow by a second.</p>\n<p>Healy himself also rocketed up the GC standings to eighth, and third in the best young rider standings.</p>\n<p>After starting the day leading three classifications, Pogaƒçar relinquished his lead in all of them on Thursday, as Tim Wellens goes back into polka-dots, and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) takes green.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nDespite the early feeling that the 201.5km stage to Vire Normandie would be a good day for the breakaway, there was a delay in the initial attacks, as it was clear that teams like Lidl-Trek and Intermarch√©-Wanty intended to keep things together until the intermediate sprint after 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what happened, and at the sprint there was a big battle for the points, with Jonathan Milan taking the maximum in front of Van der Poel and Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty). The break attempts immediately launched off the back of the sprint, with Healy and Simmons the first to go.</p>\n<p>The next 15km was a continued battle for the break, with groups trying to bridge to Healy and Simmons, but all came back together over the top of the first climb, where Simmons took maximum points with the peloton right behind him. A minute back ‚Äì and growing ‚Äì a group including Milan, Girmay and Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) was already dropped on the furious, hilly start to the stage.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) spearheaded the next move, but that didn&#8217;t stick either, and it was a long, arduous, washing machine of a process before a break finally appeared to form, 65km into the stage.</p>\n<p>It was at first five: Van der Poel, Simmons, Healy, Will Barta (Movistar) and Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana), but grew to eight over the next few kilometres as Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla), Michar Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) and Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) bridged across from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Finally, after 70km of rapid racing, the situation finally began to settle, and the peloton allowed the break to build up a lead of two minutes. Behind, the dropped riders were truly out of the race, with the gap eventually growing up to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>For the next 50km, with no categorised climbs for a while, the break worked hard to try and build their lead. However, the peloton and UAE Team Emirates were clearly not going to let the gap balloon, and kept things controlled. With 70km to go, the eight leaders pushed the lead out towards three minutes, though Visma and UAE weren&#8217;t sitting up behind, with the yellow jersey in the balance as Van der Poel needed less than a minute and half to take the race lead.</p>\n<p>At the next king of the mountains, the C√¥te de Mortain, Dunbar just chipped off the group to take the maximum points. As the break got into the hiller final 50km, the gap grew out towards four minutes, as it became clear that the breakaway were going to be able to contend the win in one way or another.</p>\n<p><strong>The decisive attack</strong><br />\nWith 42km to go, the attacks in the break began, with most riders not wanting to go to the line with Van der Poel. Healy was the first to put in a big dig, and he managed to break clear on his own, building a gap of 30 seconds over a few kilometres.</p>\n<p>There was a bit of a lack of cohesion in the break behind, with it not clear who should, or could, chase Healy, and perhaps an assumption that he was at a disadvantage on his own. However, the young Irishman kept increasing his lead over the next kilometres, up to 46 seconds with 30km to go, with the peloton five minutes down.</p>\n<p>On the next climb, the C√≥te de Saint-Michel-de-Montiole, Storer and Simmons attacked from the break to chase Healy. They quickly built a good gap over the rest of the group, but were still a minute back from Healy with 20km to go, and the gaps only continued to grow.</p>\n<p>With 10km to go, Healy&#8217;s gap was nearly two minutes over Simmons and Storer, and two-and-a-half minutes over the Van der Poel group, with the peloton almost seven minutes back, meaning Van der Poel had a chance of taking yellow. Simmons and Storer started to attack each other in the final 6km, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to make any inroads into Healy.</p>\n<p>The tough finale made it a hard, dragged out finish for Healy, but it was joy at the end as he claimed his first Tour stage win, 2:44 ahead of the chasers. Simmons and Storer fought it out for second, with the American&#8217;s punchier finish getting the better of the Australian in the end.</p>\n<p>The second chasing group began to break apart in the last 5km, and Van der Poel found himself dropped, and therefore battling to try and take the yellow jersey as the peloton began to accelerate behind him.</p>\n<p>Despite the race win being well gone, there was a bit of a GC fight up the final climb in the peloton, with Visma trying to test Pogaƒçar, but ultimately the Slovenian was the strongest, finishing in front of Vingegaard. He sprinted to the line, possibly trying to hold onto the yellow, but was just one second too slow, and the race lead went back to Van der Poel, just a day after he lost it in the TT.</p>\n<p>Dropped early, the gruppetto of sprinters did eventually make it home, 30 minutes down on Healy but well within the time cut.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel now leads the Tour by just one second over Pogaƒçar, with another battle possible on stage 7 with its Mur de Bretagne finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

And then once we were in there, we really had to work for that gap and it was just on the pedals all day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew I needed to get away from the group and pick my moment, and I think I timed it well and hopefully caught them by surprise a little bit. But I knew what I had to do: just head down and do my best ride to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Poel finished in the third group on the road, the last of the remaining breakaway riders, and despite a sprinting finish from Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates), the Dutchman managed to take back yellow by a single second and now leads the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>GC action almost kicked off on the final climb, with Visma-Lease a Bike trying to test Pogaƒçar, or perhaps shorten the gap and force the Slovenian to keep the jersey. But ultimately, though Pogaƒçar beat Vingegaard to the line, he did lose yellow by a second.</p>\n<p>Healy himself also rocketed up the GC standings to eighth, and third in the best young rider standings.</p>\n<p>After starting the day leading three classifications, Pogaƒçar relinquished his lead in all of them on Thursday, as Tim Wellens goes back into polka-dots, and Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) takes green.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nDespite the early feeling that the 201.5km stage to Vire Normandie would be a good day for the breakaway, there was a delay in the initial attacks, as it was clear that teams like Lidl-Trek and Intermarch√©-Wanty intended to keep things together until the intermediate sprint after 20 kilometres.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what happened, and at the sprint there was a big battle for the points, with Jonathan Milan taking the maximum in front of Van der Poel and Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty). The break attempts immediately launched off the back of the sprint, with Healy and Simmons the first to go.</p>\n<p>The next 15km was a continued battle for the break, with groups trying to bridge to Healy and Simmons, but all came back together over the top of the first climb, where Simmons took maximum points with the peloton right behind him. A minute back ‚Äì and growing ‚Äì a group including Milan, Girmay and Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) was already dropped on the furious, hilly start to the stage.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) spearheaded the next move, but that didn&#8217;t stick either, and it was a long, arduous, washing machine of a process before a break finally appeared to form, 65km into the stage.</p>\n<p>It was at first five: Van der Poel, Simmons, Healy, Will Barta (Movistar) and Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana), but grew to eight over the next few kilometres as Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla), Michar Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) and Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) bridged across from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Finally, after 70km of rapid racing, the situation finally began to settle, and the peloton allowed the break to build up a lead of two minutes. Behind, the dropped riders were truly out of the race, with the gap eventually growing up to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>For the next 50km, with no categorised climbs for a while, the break worked hard to try and build their lead. However, the peloton and UAE Team Emirates were clearly not going to let the gap balloon, and kept things controlled. With 70km to go, the eight leaders pushed the lead out towards three minutes, though Visma and UAE weren&#8217;t sitting up behind, with the yellow jersey in the balance as Van der Poel needed less than a minute and half to take the race lead.</p>\n<p>At the next king of the mountains, the C√¥te de Mortain, Dunbar just chipped off the group to take the maximum points. As the break got into the hiller final 50km, the gap grew out towards four minutes, as it became clear that the breakaway were going to be able to contend the win in one way or another.</p>\n<p><strong>The decisive attack</strong><br />\nWith 42km to go, the attacks in the break began, with most riders not wanting to go to the line with Van der Poel. Healy was the first to put in a big dig, and he managed to break clear on his own, building a gap of 30 seconds over a few kilometres.</p>\n<p>There was a bit of a lack of cohesion in the break behind, with it not clear who should, or could, chase Healy, and perhaps an assumption that he was at a disadvantage on his own. However, the young Irishman kept increasing his lead over the next kilometres, up to 46 seconds with 30km to go, with the peloton five minutes down.</p>\n<p>On the next climb, the C√≥te de Saint-Michel-de-Montiole, Storer and Simmons attacked from the break to chase Healy. They quickly built a good gap over the rest of the group, but were still a minute back from Healy with 20km to go, and the gaps only continued to grow.</p>\n<p>With 10km to go, Healy&#8217;s gap was nearly two minutes over Simmons and Storer, and two-and-a-half minutes over the Van der Poel group, with the peloton almost seven minutes back, meaning Van der Poel had a chance of taking yellow. Simmons and Storer started to attack each other in the final 6km, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to make any inroads into Healy.</p>\n<p>The tough finale made it a hard, dragged out finish for Healy, but it was joy at the end as he claimed his first Tour stage win, 2:44 ahead of the chasers. Simmons and Storer fought it out for second, with the American&#8217;s punchier finish getting the better of the Australian in the end.</p>\n<p>The second chasing group began to break apart in the last 5km, and Van der Poel found himself dropped, and therefore battling to try and take the yellow jersey as the peloton began to accelerate behind him.</p>\n<p>Despite the race win being well gone, there was a bit of a GC fight up the final climb in the peloton, with Visma trying to test Pogaƒçar, but ultimately the Slovenian was the strongest, finishing in front of Vingegaard. He sprinted to the line, possibly trying to hold onto the yellow, but was just one second too slow, and the race lead went back to Van der Poel, just a day after he lost it in the TT.</p>\n<p>Dropped early, the gruppetto of sprinters did eventually make it home, 30 minutes down on Healy but well within the time cut.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel now leads the Tour by just one second over Pogaƒçar, with another battle possible on stage 7 with its Mur de Bretagne finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Olympic and world time trial champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) duly delivered on his stage favourite status on stage 5 of the Tour de France, powering to victory in the 33km time trial in Caen as Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) took yellow.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel recorded a time of 36:42 to take the stage win, whilst Pogaƒçar finished second, 16 seconds down on the Belgian but with enough time to take the race lead for the first time in this Tour.</p>\n<p>Third place on the day went to European champion Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease a Bike), who set a fast time early on and held off everyone but Evenepoel and Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) put in a valiant attempt to try and hold onto yellow, but ultimately finished 18th, handing the race lead over to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>It was a difficult day for Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike), who lost 1:21 to Evenepoel, and 1:05 to Pogaƒçar in a blow to his GC position after just five stages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because of course big guys like Edoardo, they can do these courses very well as well. Also they can save a little bit more in the finals like yesterday,&#8221; Evenepoel said at the finish when asked if he knew he had the upper hand on stage 5.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I knew I had a good chance, but of course the legs still have to be there and everything has to go to plan. In the end I think it was pretty good. I didn&#8217;t really feel like I could go any faster, so I think in general I&#8217;m happy with the result, of course. It&#8217;s a second stage win for our team, it&#8217;s super nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Evenepoel went through the first two time checks down on the fastest times, but credited his win to his steady pace, not going out too fast as some of the riders who were faster than him at the intermediates may have.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I kind of pushed pretty steady, every slightly uphill part I pushed harder than the downhills of course, but I think my strongest point was that I kept the same pace in the end as in the first 10k, so I think that really put up my pace and my speed,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also what we saw in the intermediates, that I was always going up, and also still gaining time in the last kilometres, so I think I paced it perfectly and everything was on point.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Thanks to his efforts ‚Äì and Vingegaard&#8217;s bad day ‚Äì Evenepoel is up to second overall, 42 seconds down on Pogaƒçar. Vingegaard moves down one place to fourth, 1:13 down on the lead, whilst a hugely-impressive ride from local rider K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) moved him to third overall.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel moves down to sixth overall, with his focus likely to shift to stage wins and the green jersey, whilst the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe duo of Florian Lipowitz and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç both moved into the top 10 after the TT.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 33km time trial starting and finishing in Caen was flat and relatively straightforward, meaning it was a day for the specialists, where power counted. Of the first starters, Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar) set the early benchmark, whilst Luke Plapp (Jayco AlUla) started fast but paid for it in the end and faded.</p>\n<p>Romeo&#8217;s time in the hot seat was short, as he was soon knocked off the top spot by European champion Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease a Bike), who took a big chunk out of his time, stopping the clock at 37:15.</p>\n<p>Bruno Armirail (Groupama-FDJ) came painfully close to beating Affini&#8217;s time, two seconds adrift, and was clearly upset that he hadn&#8217;t done so. But other than the French national champ, no other riders for a long time came close to troubling the Italian&#8217;s time, or even the top five. During the middle part of the day, only Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) posted a time worth noticing, at 38:07.</p>\n<p>The first of the GC riders to set off was Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who had a largely unimpressive ride, and all eyes were on the bigger names still to come. In fact, Rogliƒç would end up losing 21 seconds to his teammate and potential GC contender Florian Lipowitz.</p>\n<p>The favourite all day, Evenepoel started fast on his golden bike, and passed the first time check three seconds down on Plapp&#8217;s fastest time, but with the expectation that he would pace his effort better than the Australian did, and well up on Affini.</p>\n<p>At time check two, the Belgian was still eight seconds down, likely due to the headwind in the first part of the course for the later riders, though he was still faster than Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>However, he turned red to green at time check three, going 11 seconds faster than Affini there as the stage win swung back in his favour. With a sprint to the line, Evenepoel stopped the clock 33 seconds faster than Affini, in a time that wouldn&#8217;t be beaten, delivering him to his second Tour de France stage victory.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar put it all down to try and come as close to Evenepoel as possible, rattling through the corners and even having a few sketchy moments, which wasn&#8217;t enough to beat Evenepoel but did earn him yellow, finishing just 16 seconds down on the world champion.</p>\n<p>It was a much less successful day for Vingegaard, usually known as a strong time trialist, who appeared to struggle early on and shipped a minute and more to his main yellow jersey rivals.</p>\n<p>Outside of the top three and the GC story, white jersey K√©vin Vauquelin put in a TT of a lifetime to finish fifth on the day, losing white to Evenepoel but cementing his local hero status, whilst Lipowitz finished sixth in what will be a boost to his GC campaign. After &#8220;flying too close to the sun&#8221;, as he put it, Plapp held on to finish ninth.</p>\n<p>As expected, the GC has been reshuffled on the roads of Caen, with Vingegaard the clear biggest loser, and Pogaƒçar in the driving seat early on, but with 16 stages and thousands of metres of climbing still to come, there is still a big overall fight to come in this Tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) sprinted to the 100th victory of his career on stage 4 of the Tour de France, outpacing race leader Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to the line at the end of the uphill drag into Rouen.</p>\n<p>Following a similar showdown on stage 2 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, the pair went head-to-head once again on the 5% slope to the line, with Van der Poel launching the sprint before the World Champion came around the outside to nip through and take the win with a sharp finishing acceleration.</p>\n<p>Further back, Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) rounded out the podium to shed six bonus seconds to his great GC rival. The Dane now lies eight seconds off Pogaƒçar, who is level on time with Van der Poel as the Dutchman remains in yellow on countback.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think today everybody was on the limit. I tried with an attack on the last climb and then Jonas [Vingegaard] followed me and then everything came together,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúJo√£o [Almeida] did such an amazing job to lead me out until the very end, even if people were attacking. I‚Äôm super happy and proud of the team today, amazing. I‚Äôm just without words. It‚Äôs such a nice victory.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTo win at the Tour is incredible, in this jersey even more, and to have 100 victories is amazing,&#8221; Pogaƒçar continued.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWith so many good riders in the final, you‚Äôre always a bit on the edge and nervous about what‚Äôs going to happen. You never know until the final, like today. You get this adrenaline. It‚Äôs pure racing and I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see tomorrow,‚Äù he replied when asked about going for yellow during Wednesday‚Äôs 33km time trial. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the real test. Even already to win a stage in this jersey is enough for me. I‚Äôll just go and enjoy this race. Of course, we‚Äôll aim for the yellow, but we‚Äôll see.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The battle for the GC ignited over the hills leading into Rouen, with five classified climbs coming in the final 60km of the 174.2km day. It was on the final of the quintet, the steep slopes of the Rampe Saint-Hilaire (800m at 10.6%), which saw the big names launch.</p>\n<p>On the way up, a lead-out train from Visma-Lease A Bike turned into a Jo√£o Almeida lead-out for Pogaƒçar, with the Slovenian making his move at 5.5km to go. Only Vingegaard could follow, though even he had to battle to stay in touch over the top.</p>\n<p>A chase group including Van der Poel, Almeida, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), and Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) came across before the final ramp, thanks to the Belgian‚Äôs efforts on the front, setting up a grandstand finish.</p>\n<p>Almeida was back up front on the run to the line, chasing down a short-lived Jorgenson move, while it was Van der Poel who launched the sprint from his wheel. For a moment, it looked as though he‚Äôd claim a third stage win in four days for Alpecin-Deceuninck, but he didn‚Äôt quite have enough to hold off Pogaƒçar this time, instead being forced to settle for second place.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel continues in the race lead ahead of the stage 5 time trial in Caen, level on time with Pogaƒçar, who is back in the polka dot jersey after leading the way over the day&#8217;s final climb.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard lies third, eight seconds behind the duo, while Evenepoel shed three seconds at the finish and now lies ninth overall at 58 seconds. Primo≈∫ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), was nowhere at the finish, finishing 32 seconds down in 18th place. He&#8217;s down in 12th overall, 1:27 off the race lead.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 4 of the Tour de France saw the race heading south for the first time after the Grand D√©part in the far north of the country, with a hilly 174.2km taking the riders from Amiens down to Rouen, two hours north-west of Paris.</p>\n<p>The day featured 1,700 metres of climbing, though much of it was packed into the closing 60km, with each of the categorised climbs coming late on. The fourth-category C√¥te Jacques Anquetil (3.5km at 3.6%) at 46km from the line was followed by the third-category C√¥te de Belbeuf (1.3km at 9.1%), a pair more of fourth-category hills in the C√¥te de Bonsecours (900m at 7.2%) and the C√¥te de la Grand‚ÄôMare (1.8km at 5%).</p>\n<p>The final major challenge of the stage would come with the Rampe Saint-Hilaire (800m at 10.6%), peaking at 5.2km from the finish, which came at the end of a 500-metre, 5% ramp.</p>\n<p>Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) and Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) attacked as soon as the flag dropped to begin the stage, with Thomas Gachignard (TotalEnergies) coming across to make it a three-man move after 6km.</p>\n<p>The peloton was more than happy for the trio to ride off up the road, though Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost) was keen to get out of the group and make it a breakaway quartet. The Dane made a move 8km into the stage, eventually working his way across the two-minute gap after 17km of racing.</p>\n<p>The peloton, led by Alpecin-Deceuninck, held the group at two minutes during the quiet middle period of the stage, with the Belgian team hoping to launch Van der Poel to a second stage win in Rouen.</p>\n<p>Up front, three of the four breakaway men would be hoping against hope that they could strike out for their first career Tour stage win.</p>\n<p>Asgreen already had a Tour stage on his palmar√®s after triumphing from the break in Bourg-en-Bresse two years ago, while Abrahamsen memorably made six breaks, wore two jerseys, and took two combativity prizes at last year‚Äôs race.</p>\n<p>As was the case on stage 3, very little happened during the day, even if this time there was actually a breakaway on the stage. Once again, the crashes came, with Yevgeniy Fedorov (XDS-Astana), Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies), and Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) caught up in a spill with just over 50km to go.</p>\n<p>A few kilometres later, Cees Bol (XDS-Astana) and Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep) went down, too, though there were no disastrous DNFs as was the case with Jasper Philipsen on Monday.</p>\n<p>By the time the break hit the C√¥te Jacques Anquetil, their advantage had melted away to 1:15. Asgreen took the chance to pick up a point and get his name on the mountain classification leaderboard ahead of Martinez.</p>\n<p>The tension in the bunch racheted up as the stage final neared, but riders managed to avoid further crashes on the road to the intermediate sprint. There was bad luck, however, for Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling), who lost a minute waiting for a bike change.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) extended his green jersey at the sprint with 31km to go, grabbing 11 points ahead of the 10 of Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and the nine of Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p><strong>GC battles in the hilly final</strong><br />\nGachignard was caught just before the C√¥te de Belbeuf, 29km from the line, while up front Martinez pushed on alone on the steep slopes of the hill, leaving Abrahamsen and Asgreen to be caught by the peloton. The Frenchman took two KOM points at the top, while polka dot jersey Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) nipped out another point of his own to consolidate his classification lead.</p>\n<p>The race from the Belbeuf to the C√¥te de Bonsecours was marked by a crash which took out multiple riders, including Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana) and Mick van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) sprinted to the 100th victory of his career on stage 4 of the Tour de France, outpacing race leader Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) to the line at the end of the uphill drag into Rouen.</p>\n<p>Following a similar showdown on stage 2 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, the pair went head-to-head once again on the 5% slope to the line, with Van der Poel launching the sprint before the World Champion came around the outside to nip through and take the win with a sharp finishing acceleration.</p>\n<p>Further back, Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) rounded out the podium to shed six bonus seconds to his great GC rival. The Dane now lies eight seconds off Pogaƒçar, who is level on time with Van der Poel as the Dutchman remains in yellow on countback.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think today everybody was on the limit. I tried with an attack on the last climb and then Jonas [Vingegaard] followed me and then everything came together,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúJo√£o [Almeida] did such an amazing job to lead me out until the very end, even if people were attacking. I‚Äôm super happy and proud of the team today, amazing. I‚Äôm just without words. It‚Äôs such a nice victory.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTo win at the Tour is incredible, in this jersey even more, and to have 100 victories is amazing,&#8221; Pogaƒçar continued.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWith so many good riders in the final, you‚Äôre always a bit on the edge and nervous about what‚Äôs going to happen. You never know until the final, like today. You get this adrenaline. It‚Äôs pure racing and I enjoy it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see tomorrow,‚Äù he replied when asked about going for yellow during Wednesday‚Äôs 33km time trial. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the real test. Even already to win a stage in this jersey is enough for me. I‚Äôll just go and enjoy this race. Of course, we‚Äôll aim for the yellow, but we‚Äôll see.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The battle for the GC ignited over the hills leading into Rouen, with five classified climbs coming in the final 60km of the 174.2km day. It was on the final of the quintet, the steep slopes of the Rampe Saint-Hilaire (800m at 10.6%), which saw the big names launch.</p>\n<p>On the way up, a lead-out train from Visma-Lease A Bike turned into a Jo√£o Almeida lead-out for Pogaƒçar, with the Slovenian making his move at 5.5km to go. Only Vingegaard could follow, though even he had to battle to stay in touch over the top.</p>\n<p>A chase group including Van der Poel, Almeida, Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), and Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) came across before the final ramp, thanks to the Belgian‚Äôs efforts on the front, setting up a grandstand finish.</p>\n<p>Almeida was back up front on the run to the line, chasing down a short-lived Jorgenson move, while it was Van der Poel who launched the sprint from his wheel. For a moment, it looked as though he‚Äôd claim a third stage win in four days for Alpecin-Deceuninck, but he didn‚Äôt quite have enough to hold off Pogaƒçar this time, instead being forced to settle for second place.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel continues in the race lead ahead of the stage 5 time trial in Caen, level on time with Pogaƒçar, who is back in the polka dot jersey after leading the way over the day&#8217;s final climb.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard lies third, eight seconds behind the duo, while Evenepoel shed three seconds at the finish and now lies ninth overall at 58 seconds. Primo≈∫ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), was nowhere at the finish, finishing 32 seconds down in 18th place. He&#8217;s down in 12th overall, 1:27 off the race lead.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 4 of the Tour de France saw the race heading south for the first time after the Grand D√©part in the far north of the country, with a hilly 174.2km taking the riders from Amiens down to Rouen, two hours north-west of Paris.</p>\n<p>The day featured 1,700 metres of climbing, though much of it was packed into the closing 60km, with each of the categorised climbs coming late on. The fourth-category C√¥te Jacques Anquetil (3.5km at 3.6%) at 46km from the line was followed by the third-category C√¥te de Belbeuf (1.3km at 9.1%), a pair more of fourth-category hills in the C√¥te de Bonsecours (900m at 7.2%) and the C√¥te de la Grand‚ÄôMare (1.8km at 5%).</p>\n<p>The final major challenge of the stage would come with the Rampe Saint-Hilaire (800m at 10.6%), peaking at 5.2km from the finish, which came at the end of a 500-metre, 5% ramp.</p>\n<p>Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) and Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility) attacked as soon as the flag dropped to begin the stage, with Thomas Gachignard (TotalEnergies) coming across to make it a three-man move after 6km.</p>\n<p>The peloton was more than happy for the trio to ride off up the road, though Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost) was keen to get out of the group and make it a breakaway quartet. The Dane made a move 8km into the stage, eventually working his way across the two-minute gap after 17km of racing.</p>\n<p>The peloton, led by Alpecin-Deceuninck, held the group at two minutes during the quiet middle period of the stage, with the Belgian team hoping to launch Van der Poel to a second stage win in Rouen.</p>\n<p>Up front, three of the four breakaway men would be hoping against hope that they could strike out for their first career Tour stage win.</p>\n<p>Asgreen already had a Tour stage on his palmar√®s after triumphing from the break in Bourg-en-Bresse two years ago, while Abrahamsen memorably made six breaks, wore two jerseys, and took two combativity prizes at last year‚Äôs race.</p>\n<p>As was the case on stage 3, very little happened during the day, even if this time there was actually a breakaway on the stage. Once again, the crashes came, with Yevgeniy Fedorov (XDS-Astana), Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies), and Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) caught up in a spill with just over 50km to go.</p>\n<p>A few kilometres later, Cees Bol (XDS-Astana) and Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep) went down, too, though there were no disastrous DNFs as was the case with Jasper Philipsen on Monday.</p>\n<p>By the time the break hit the C√¥te Jacques Anquetil, their advantage had melted away to 1:15. Asgreen took the chance to pick up a point and get his name on the mountain classification leaderboard ahead of Martinez.</p>\n<p>The tension in the bunch racheted up as the stage final neared, but riders managed to avoid further crashes on the road to the intermediate sprint. There was bad luck, however, for Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling), who lost a minute waiting for a bike change.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) extended his green jersey at the sprint with 31km to go, grabbing 11 points ahead of the 10 of Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and the nine of Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p><strong>GC battles in the hilly final</strong><br />\nGachignard was caught just before the C√¥te de Belbeuf, 29km from the line, while up front Martinez pushed on alone on the steep slopes of the hill, leaving Abrahamsen and Asgreen to be caught by the peloton. The Frenchman took two KOM points at the top, while polka dot jersey Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) nipped out another point of his own to consolidate his classification lead.</p>\n<p>The race from the Belbeuf to the C√¥te de Bonsecours was marked by a crash which took out multiple riders, including Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana) and Mick van Dijke (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep) looked to have come off the worst, though, with the Frenchman sat crying by the roadside after hitting the deck.</p>\n<p>The race stopped for nobody, however, and UAE Team Emirates-XRG continued to push the pace at the front into the final 20km.

But after UAE&#8217;s Jo√£o Almeida dragged a reduced front group back up to the German, Van der Poel was able to fend off the 2024 overall winner and top favourite for yellow in the 2025 race, with Vingegaard showing strong form in unfamiliar terrain to claim third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was super difficult, the final was actually harder than I thought,&#8221; Van der Poel said as he celebrated his team&#8217;s second stage win in as many days.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was really motivated. It&#8217;s been three or four years since I last won a stage (2021 &#8211; Ed.) so it was about time I got another one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People said I was a favourite for today, but if you see which riders were up there on the climbs, I think I did a really good job to be there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a 15-minute delay to the start because of traffic jams outside the small start town of Lauwin-Planque, the race began in miserably rainy conditions.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, given the weather and the unusual length of the stage, no sooner had four riders &#8211; Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility), Brent Van Moer (Lotto), stage 1 breakaway Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R) and Yevgeniy Fedorov (XDS-Astana) &#8211; made it out of the pack than things shut down completely behind. Intermarch√©-Wanty joined forces with Alpecin-Deceuninck to keep things under control, but with the gap hovering around 2:40 to 2:50 for many kilometres, it was clear that it was nothing more than a token holding action.</p>\n<p>For the next two hours, there was barely any real change in the scenario. Given the technical finale, it was fortunate that the weather slowly improved, the roads dried out and multiple rain jackets were handed back into the following team cars.</p>\n<p>After crashing with Fedorov earlier in the breakaway, Leknessund&#8217;s woes continued with a rear tyre puncture, but he was able to regain contact as the race gradually neared the first classified climb of the day, the category 4 C√¥te de Cavron-Saint Martin. Leknessund finally outpowered Van Moer at the end of a thrilling two-up duel, too, tearing past the Belgian for the single point on offer.</p>\n<p>As the 209.1-kilometre stage reached its halfway point, a sharp rise in speed in the front of the pack was matched by a crash at the back, involving around a dozen riders including Lennert van Eetvelt (Lotto), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla) and Fred Wright (Bahrain Victorious). Van Eetvelt was one of the worst affected, but with three teammates guiding him along, the Lotto GC leader slowly regained ground on the pack.</p>\n<p>The rise in tension was a foretaste of what was to come, though, as shortly afterwards when the race hit the coast roads and the wind speed picked up, the GC men began moving closer to the front and the intermediate sprint in Enocq acted as an unofficial start to the race finale.</p>\n<p>Although the bunch couldn&#8217;t quite bring back the early break before the sprint, taken by Fedorov, the real surprise came when Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) took fifth place in the peloton, only to roundly berate Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) for an unspecified action during the build-up.</p>\n<p>The four breakaway riders were swept up shortly afterwards, and as the road began to rise and fall relentlessly on a series of short, late climbs, the battle for position became even more intense, with Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) fighting for a long time to get back on after a mechanical.</p>\n<p>Just as in the crosswinds of stage 1, Visma-Lease a Bike dominated at the front as the bunch stormed onto the second of the day&#8217;s classified climbs, the category 3 C√¥te de Haut Pichot. Wout van Aert and Tim Wellens drove hard on the short, narrow climb for Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar respectively, and although there was a minor crash involving Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers), thankfully there were no serious incidents.</p>\n<p>Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quickstep) was briefly caught out in a split over the top, though, when some 40 riders moved briefly away, but his group was able to rejoin quickly.</p>\n<p>With all the challenges cancelling each other out, the outcome of the stage was going to be dictated by the final two ascents of the day, the C√¥te de Saint-Etienne-au-Mont (cat. 3) and the C√¥te de Outreau (cat. 4), this latter just five kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>A section of broad, open road allowed all the top teams to mass on the front of a large bunch, even if stragglers including Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Matej Mohoric (Bahrain Victorious). But one potential stage contender, Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) and a big group of sprinters including Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) had no chance of getting back on terms.</p>\n<p>The fight for position went all the way to the foot of the Saint-Etienne-au-Mont climb, as Soudal and Tudor joined forces on one side of the broad road, EF Education-EasyPost on the left. Once again on the severely technical run-in, Visma-Lease a Bike were notably present at the front at the crunch moments.</p>\n<p>The 15% slopes of the Saint-Etienne-au-Mont was first tackled by Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), with Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard close behind as the climb narrowed the group to a single-file line. A lunge from Visma&#8217;s Matteo Jorgenson was shadowed by Pogaƒçar as the front group briefly whittled down to six or eight, with Evenepoel close behind this time and then briefly making a dig in person to keep the pace high. Philipsen, meanwhile, was some 11 seconds further back and in danger of losing his lead.</p>\n<p>A larger group containing Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) regained contact at the foot of the C√¥te d&#8217;Outreau, the last ascent of the day, but the ferocious skirmishing between Alpecin &#8211; now riding for Van der Poel, not Philipsen &#8211; UAE and Visma continued and ultimately shred the peloton to a front group of less than 30.</p>\n<p>First, Pogaƒçar darted ahead to take the last point on offer at the top of the climb &#8211; making a surprise move into the lead of the mountains classification &#8211; and then Vingegaard tried to ambush the opposition.

UAE, though, were having none of it, even when Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) made a very determined effort on the last segment of flat that remained.

The GC battle, though, once again also featured strongly as there were only 29 riders in the front group behind the Dutch star.</p>\n<p>This time and unlike on stage 1, the leaders contained both Rogliƒç and Evenepoel alongside Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, but others &#8211; most notably Jayco-AlUla&#8217;s Ben O&#8217;Connor and Ineos Grenadiers Carlos Rodr√≠guez &#8211; were both missing from the mix. In just two days of racing, in fact, a hierarchy in the Tour&#8217;s overall classification is already beginning to take shape, even if at the top of the GC ranking and in terms of stage wins, Alpecin-Deceuninck are ruling supreme.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In just two days of racing, in fact, a hierarchy in the Tour&#8217;s overall classification is already beginning to take shape, even if at the top of the GC ranking and in terms of stage wins, Alpecin-Deceuninck are ruling supreme.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>A devastating sprint saw Jasper Philipsen storm to his tenth Tour de France stage victory and his first ever overall lead in the race on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Philipsen won from a reduced peloton after a late echelon split left Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) 39 seconds adrift of the other top favourites.</p>\n<p>Several bike lengths behind Philipsen on a fraught, crash-filled stage starting and finishing in Lille M√©tropole, Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) made strides toward a repeat green jersey with second on the stage and third in the intermediate sprint. S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) was third at the line.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) made the 38-rider lead group but it was Alpecin-Deceuninck who had the numbers, with Van der Poel finally providing Philipsen with the perfect leadout at the end of a dramatic day.</p>\n<p>The big GC losers on the day, though, were Evenepoel and Rogliƒç, caught on the wrong side of a split inspired by Visma-Lease a Bike that formed in incessant cross winds with some 15 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>While Rogliƒç and Evenepoel had to rue an important time loss already on day one, Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) was even more unfortunate, crashing heavily and then becoming the 2025 Tour&#8217;s first abandon mid-way through the stage.</p>\n<p>The stage victory gives Philipsen the first race leader&#8217;s jersey of the race as well as the first green jersey. Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) leads the mountains classification after claiming two points from the day&#8217;s breakaway while Girmay, 25, is the best young rider.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really amazing, this tenth victory is something I&#8217;ll never forget,&#8221; Philipsen said about how he made it into double figures in the Tour.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just the team performance &#8211; we were up there all day. It was very nervous but today just had to be our day and we had to be in the front and we were there in the split, the team did amazing, and in the end we just had to use our strength, be there and finish it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course I knew I had really good legs, and the final two kilometres with all the people gave me goosebumps. I knew we just had to do it and my legs got some extra strength because of the adrenaline riding through Lille. It was just an incredible feeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nNo sooner had race director Christian Prudhomme blown his whistle to signal the off than five riders went clear: Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Bruno Armiral (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies). In no time at all, the quintet opened up the gap of 90 seconds and counting, while the peloton settled down to a much steadier pace behind. It was only when the five&#8217;s margin reached 2:30 that Alpecin-Deceuninck began tapping out a steady but not overly fast rhythm on the front of the bunch.</p>\n<p>After a very quiet opening hour, things began to hot up in the battle for the first categorized climb of the Tour, the C√¥te de Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On the very narrow road, packed with spectators, French TT National Champion Armirail went from distance but it was to no avail, and instead it was 2024 Giro d&#8217;Italia stage winner Benjamin Thomas who crossed the summit line in first place. Meanwhile Deceuninck received extra support from Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Quinn Simmons to keep the pace high behind.</p>\n<p>The bunch&#8217;s speed remained notably higher following the climb, perhaps explaining why after a crash-free start to the first third of the stage, Ganna was unlucky enough to come down heavily on a right-hand bend. Able to get back up relatively quickly but also in need of a spare bike, after various checks from race medics he began riding, only to find he had a broken right shoe that needed replacing. However, that proved to be the least of his woes as the pain from the crash visibly increased and after a long struggle to remain in the race, the Italian TT champion later abandoned.</p>\n<p>Gannas was the first but not the only rider in trouble as the day abruptly turned fraught after its calm beginning and riders began crashing in fast-rising numbers. Another top time triallist, Stefan Bissegger (Decathlon AG2R) collided with a spectator and later became the second rider after Ganna to quit the race, while Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) was also a heavy faller in his Tour de France debut, and each time the camera panned backwards behind the peloton, it was to pick up on yet another group of stragglers.</p>\n<p>The series of spills and setbacks created much more tension in the peloton, encouraging squads like UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike, to mass at the front and the five leaders&#8217; advantage to shrink notably. At the same time Bahrain Victorious leader Lenny Mart√≠nez, possibly because of illness, found himself out the back for much of the stage and would finally lose nine minutes on a disastrous day for the young Frenchman.</p>\n<p>With 105 kilometres to go, the opening break was finally sucked back in, even as Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) suffered a mechanical and also began to suffer, while Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) was also reportedly dropped. Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) used a fine lead-out to snatch maximum points in the intermediate sprint, while Philipsen, blocked behind French fastman Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) was unable to really get on terms and had to settle for fourth: later on though, the Belgian would bounce back with a vengeance.</p>\n<p>An attack by the seemingly indefatigable Vercher, quickly joined by Ben Thomas again, saw another move go clear and the peloton &#8211; finally &#8211; quieten down again. Thomas was clearly keen to go for more points in the King of the Mountains competition, and the two gained a minute&#8217;s advantage.</p>\n<p>Riding over the cobbles of the Mont Cassel, Thomas took the sprint for the summit, only for the two breakaways to collide immediately afterwards, and hit the deck. Thomas could claim the first mountains&#8217; title of the 2025 Tour de France as a result of his scant advantage, but after the peloton overtook the fallen duo, his injuries also forced the Frenchman to visit the doctor several times as the race began winding back towards Lille.</p>\n<p>Yet more opportunities for crosswinds, touching over 50kmh at times, emerged in the final 40 kilometres on what had already been a fraught, crash-filled day. Initially, with repeated warnings from sports directors crackling in their ears, although the pace grew notably thanks to Alpecin and Soudal, nobody was caught out. However, as the roads flattened into broad highways leading back to Lille with 17 kilometres to go, Visma-Lease a Bike unfurled another concerted acceleration, and this time it caused the bunch to crumble completely and definitively.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar was ahead with Time Wellens in the 40-strong lead group, as was Vingegaard, but two key men missing from the mix, in what seemed to be like the last major danger point for crosswinds on stage 1, were Evenepoel and Primoz Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel&#8217;s challenges did not end there as he was forced at one point to swerve onto a grass verge, fortunately staying upright. But in any case Alpecin-Deceuninck, oblivious to the Belgian&#8217;s challenges but present in numbers on the front were visibly determined to press on and they joined forces with Vingegaard&#8217;s troops. Then when Belgian National Champion Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) began contributing, the gap between the two groups yawned quickly open to 25 seconds and by the finish line it stood at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p>Behind Soudal-QuickStep and Lidl-Trek offered the most resistance to the concerted Deceuninck-Visma drive ahead in the 40-strong lead group. But Visma had said before the Tour they were going to be present in the race with a Classics-style group to back Vingegaard and their policy paid off perfectly fron the word go, while Deceuninck, too, were never going to turn a chance like this down. &#8220;It was all day a fight to be there at the moment, always a lot of stress for not much actually happening and then suddenly in the last 15 kilometres it all opened up,&#8221; Philipsen said later. &#8220;It was a hell of an opportunity and I&#8217;m so glad we took it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was time for yet more drama in the suburbs of Lille, as Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AlUla) was unlucky enough to fall, though fortunately it was inside the &#8216;secure zone&#8217; of five-kilometres-or-less before the finish. Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar briefly hovered at the front of the lead, but as Alpecin-Deceuninck made their presence known again, there was to be no repeat of the Dauphin√©&#8217;s opening stage, where the late attacks by the Dane had foiled the sprinters.</p>\n<p>Instead a magnificent leadout from Van der Poel saw Philipsen come surging down the right-hand side of the road, and although Girmay was able to limit the gap, the Belgian star fastman had an ample advantage by the time he crossed the line. The other sprinters will have a chance again as soon as Monday at Dunkerque, but for Evenepoel and Rogliƒç, though, the effects of their opening setback will likely endure for considerably more than a single stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will start in Lille on 5 July, and will finish with the final stage at Champs-√âlys√©es, Paris, on 27 July.</p>\n<p>A devastating sprint saw Jasper Philipsen storm to his tenth Tour de France stage victory and his first ever overall lead in the race on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Philipsen won from a reduced peloton after a late echelon split left Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) 39 seconds adrift of the other top favourites.</p>\n<p>Several bike lengths behind Philipsen on a fraught, crash-filled stage starting and finishing in Lille M√©tropole, Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) made strides toward a repeat green jersey with second on the stage and third in the intermediate sprint. S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) was third at the line.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) made the 38-rider lead group but it was Alpecin-Deceuninck who had the numbers, with Van der Poel finally providing Philipsen with the perfect leadout at the end of a dramatic day.</p>\n<p>The big GC losers on the day, though, were Evenepoel and Rogliƒç, caught on the wrong side of a split inspired by Visma-Lease a Bike that formed in incessant cross winds with some 15 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>While Rogliƒç and Evenepoel had to rue an important time loss already on day one, Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) was even more unfortunate, crashing heavily and then becoming the 2025 Tour&#8217;s first abandon mid-way through the stage.</p>\n<p>The stage victory gives Philipsen the first race leader&#8217;s jersey of the race as well as the first green jersey. Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) leads the mountains classification after claiming two points from the day&#8217;s breakaway while Girmay, 25, is the best young rider.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really amazing, this tenth victory is something I&#8217;ll never forget,&#8221; Philipsen said about how he made it into double figures in the Tour.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just the team performance &#8211; we were up there all day. It was very nervous but today just had to be our day and we had to be in the front and we were there in the split, the team did amazing, and in the end we just had to use our strength, be there and finish it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course I knew I had really good legs, and the final two kilometres with all the people gave me goosebumps. I knew we just had to do it and my legs got some extra strength because of the adrenaline riding through Lille. It was just an incredible feeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nNo sooner had race director Christian Prudhomme blown his whistle to signal the off than five riders went clear: Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Bruno Armiral (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies). In no time at all, the quintet opened up the gap of 90 seconds and counting, while the peloton settled down to a much steadier pace behind. It was only when the five&#8217;s margin reached 2:30 that Alpecin-Deceuninck began tapping out a steady but not overly fast rhythm on the front of the bunch.</p>\n<p>After a very quiet opening hour, things began to hot up in the battle for the first categorized climb of the Tour, the C√¥te de Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On the very narrow road, packed with spectators, French TT National Champion Armirail went from distance but it was to no avail, and instead it was 2024 Giro d&#8217;Italia stage winner Benjamin Thomas who crossed the summit line in first place. Meanwhile Deceuninck received extra support from Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Quinn Simmons to keep the pace high behind.</p>\n<p>The bunch&#8217;s speed remained notably higher following the climb, perhaps explaining why after a crash-free start to the first third of the stage, Ganna was unlucky enough to come down heavily on a right-hand bend. Able to get back up relatively quickly but also in need of a spare bike, after various checks from race medics he began riding, only to find he had a broken right shoe that needed replacing. However, that proved to be the least of his woes as the pain from the crash visibly increased and after a long struggle to remain in the race, the Italian TT champion later abandoned.</p>\n<p>Gannas was the first but not the only rider in trouble as the day abruptly turned fraught after its calm beginning and riders began crashing in fast-rising numbers. Another top time triallist, Stefan Bissegger (Decathlon AG2R) collided with a spectator and later became the second rider after Ganna to quit the race, while Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) was also a heavy faller in his Tour de France debut, and each time the camera panned backwards behind the peloton, it was to pick up on yet another group of stragglers.</p>\n<p>The series of spills and setbacks created much more tension in the peloton, encouraging squads like UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike, to mass at the front and the five leaders&#8217; advantage to shrink notably. At the same time Bahrain Victorious leader Lenny Mart√≠nez, possibly because of illness, found himself out the back for much of the stage and would finally lose nine minutes on a disastrous day for the young Frenchman.</p>\n<p>With 105 kilometres to go, the opening break was finally sucked back in, even as Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) suffered a mechanical and also began to suffer, while Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) was also reportedly dropped. Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) used a fine lead-out to snatch maximum points in the intermediate sprint, while Philipsen, blocked behind French fastman Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) was unable to really get on terms and had to settle for fourth: later on though, the Belgian would bounce back with a vengeance.</p>\n<p>An attack by the seemingly indefatigable Vercher, quickly joined by Ben Thomas again, saw another move go clear and the peloton &#8211; finally &#8211; quieten down again. Thomas was clearly keen to go for more points in the King of the Mountains competition, and the two gained a minute&#8217;s advantage.</p>\n<p>Riding over the cobbles of the Mont Cassel, Thomas took the sprint for the summit, only for the two breakaways to collide immediately afterwards, and hit the deck. Thomas could claim the first mountains&#8217; title of the 2025 Tour de France as a result of his scant advantage, but after the peloton overtook the fallen duo, his injuries also forced the Frenchman to visit the doctor several times as the race began winding back towards Lille.</p>\n<p>Yet more opportunities for crosswinds, touching over 50kmh at times, emerged in the final 40 kilometres on what had already been a fraught, crash-filled day. Initially, with repeated warnings from sports directors crackling in their ears, although the pace grew notably thanks to Alpecin and Soudal, nobody was caught out. However, as the roads flattened into broad highways leading back to Lille with 17 kilometres to go, Visma-Lease a Bike unfurled another concerted acceleration, and this time it caused the bunch to crumble completely and definitively.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar was ahead with Time Wellens in the 40-strong lead group, as was Vingegaard, but two key men missing from the mix, in what seemed to be like the last major danger point for crosswinds on stage 1, were Evenepoel and Primoz Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel&#8217;s challenges did not end there as he was forced at one point to swerve onto a grass verge, fortunately staying upright. But in any case Alpecin-Deceuninck, oblivious to the Belgian&#8217;s challenges but present in numbers on the front were visibly determined to press on and they joined forces with Vingegaard&#8217;s troops. Then when Belgian National Champion Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) began contributing, the gap between the two groups yawned quickly open to 25 seconds and by the finish line it stood at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p>Behind Soudal-QuickStep and Lidl-Trek offered the most resistance to the concerted Deceuninck-Visma drive ahead in the 40-strong lead group. But Visma had said before the Tour they were going to be present in the race with a Classics-style group to back Vingegaard and their policy paid off perfectly fron the word go, while Deceuninck, too, were never going to turn a chance like this down. &#8220;It was all day a fight to be there at the moment, always a lot of stress for not much actually happening and then suddenly in the last 15 kilometres it all opened up,&#8221; Philipsen said later. &#8220;It was a hell of an opportunity and I&#8217;m so glad we took it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There was time for yet more drama in the suburbs of Lille, as Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AlUla) was unlucky enough to fall, though fortunately it was inside the &#8216;secure zone&#8217; of five-kilometres-or-less before the finish. Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar briefly hovered at the front of the lead, but as Alpecin-Deceuninck made their presence known again, there was to be no repeat of the Dauphin√©&#8217;s opening stage, where the late attacks by the Dane had foiled the sprinters.</p>\n<p>Instead a magnificent leadout from Van der Poel saw Philipsen come surging down the right-hand side of the road, and although Girmay was able to limit the gap, the Belgian star fastman had an ample advantage by the time he crossed the line. The other sprinters will have a chance again as soon as Monday at Dunkerque, but for Evenepoel and Rogliƒç, though, the effects of their opening setback will likely endure for considerably more than a single stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=17&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) snatched overall victory at the Tour de Suisse from K√©vin Vauquelin (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) with a superb ride in the final mountain time trial stage.</p>\n<p>Almeida won the stage in a time of 27:33, giving his all until the line. He beat Felix Gall (Decathlon-AG2R), who set 27:58.</p>\n<p>Vauquelin started last in the yellow jersey but seemed to struggle on the climb. He was 22 seconds down on Almeida after 4.5km and lost more time as the gradient steepened.</p>\n<p>Vauquelin set a time of 29:13, 1:40 down, meaning Almeida won the 2025 Tour de Suisse by 1:07.</p>\n<p>Scotland&#8217;s Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) set a time of 28:45, enough to finish third on the stage and lift him to third overall, ahead of Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling), who struggled and was caught by Almeida on the climb.</p>\n<p>Almeida lost 2:52 to Vauquelin on stage 1 but fought back day after day. He won stage 4 to take a minute back and then another 57 seconds on stage 5, giving him the belief that overall victory was possible. Victory on stage 7 gave him another seven precious seconds, leaving 33 seconds to make up during the final time trial.</p>\n<p>Almeida started fast, pedalled faster and could smile at the summit. He gasped for breath as he rode on beyond the finish line. He soon recovered and could watch and wait for Vauquelin to finish, and confirmation that he was the Tour de Suisse winner. He lost the 2024 race by 22 seconds. This year, the big winner&#8217;s trophy was his.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy. I did a good climb, and I was feeling really good. For once, I hope my power metre was not calibrated because I had higher numbers. I&#8217;m super happy,&#8221; Almeida said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I started too fast, I overpaced in the beginning. In the end, I hoped to have enough gas to push in the last kilometre, but in the end it was not necessary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Almeida&#8217;s early time loss turned into a valuable life lesson. &#8220;One mistake can cost you a lot; luckily, we could make it up,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it&#8217;s a lesson: you should never give up. Sometimes things go wrong and nothing is perfect, but you need to keep trying. We kept trying and we did it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He will now turn his focus to the Tour de France, but only after a moment of celebration. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have time to enjoy this win and I&#8217;ll be ready for the Tour de France,&#8221; Almeida promised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll support Tadej Pogaƒçar there and hope we can get more great wins.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de Suisse had been a thrilling battle for every second on every stage and the final 10km mountain time trial from Beckenried to Stockh√ºtte would finally confirm and crown the final overall winner.</p>\n<p>The riders raced in several waves to allow race vehicles to descend back to the start, with Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost) condemned to stay in the hot seal for a long spell after setting the fastest time of 29:27.</p>\n<p>Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Lorenzo Fortunato (Astana-XDS), Frank van den Broek (Picnic-PostNL), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) all went close to the Australian&#8217;s time but failed to take the hot seat.</p>\n<p>For most other riders the time trial was the chance to recover from an intense week of racing, especially those who had ridden the Giro d&#8217;Italia, like Bilbao, Fortunato and the USA&#8217;s Larry Warbasse (Tudor).</p>\n<p>Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AUla) lost time on the mountain stages during the week but fought back in the time trial, finishing seventh and so seventh overall, 5:08 down on Almeida.</p>\n<p>Gall showed his improving form on stage 7 and again in the time trial. He finished fast and dethroned Sweeny from the hot seat with a super effort and time of 27:58.</p>\n<p>That seemed like the stage winning time as Onley set 28:45 and Alaphilippe slipped off the final podium to fifth behind Gall, with a time of 31:22. However Almeida was on fire and despite going a little too deep early on, he had the power to survive the final steep gradients and stop the clock in a GC winning time of 29:29.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) showed he is determined to fight for overall victory at the Tour de Suisse right to the very end of the race by going deep to win the mountain stage to Emmetten. However, his biggest rival, Kevin Vauquelin (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels), was also there and refused to surrender the leader&#8217;s yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>The French rider was the first to attack in the final kilometre. He could see the finish line ahead of him, but then Almeida came past him to win the stage and take the ten-second time bonus. Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) also passed Vauquelin to take a six-second time bonus, with Vauquelin awarded four bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>That left the Frenchman 33 seconds ahead of Almeida before Sunday&#8217;s 10km uphill time trial. Almeida is a good time trialist, but so is Vauquelin, giving him an excellent chance of overall victory.</p>\n<p>Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) suffered to finish fifth on the stage but is still third overall at 41 seconds.</p>\n<p>Almeida wanted to win for the bonus seconds and to pay back his teammates.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard day, fast all day. My teammates did a perfect job; they were super strong and pulled all day to catch the breakaway. This victory is for them. Every second is important, and we had to do our best,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Almeida lost three minutes on stage 1 but has fought back every day. He will leave his all in the time trial in the hope of beating Vauquelin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the favourite for overall victory, Kevin Vauquelin is also strong in the TT, so it&#8217;s going to be tough. But I&#8217;m going to give everything I have,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe longest stage in this year&#8217;s Tour de Suisse was always going to be crucial in the general classification battle, with Sunday&#8217;s 10km uphill time trial to Stockh√ºtte set to crown the final winner.</p>\n<p>The European heatwave also hit central Switzerland, but that did not stop the early attacks. Sadly, before the break formed, the USA&#8217;s Matthew Riccitello (Israel-Premier Tech) crashed hard, and he was later forced to abandon the Tour de Suisse. He was one of many to abandon during stage 7, with some riders seriously fatigued after also riding the Giro d&#8217;Italia or injured after a series of crashes.</p>\n<p>Different-sized groups made different attempts to get away, but the peloton was never happy and so never let them go. The GC teams were especially vigilant, with UAE Team Emirates-XRG doing a lot of the chasing.</p>\n<p>The elastic only snapped after a fast 60km of racing. Suddenly Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), William Junior Lecerf (Soudal-QuickStep), Felix Engelhardt (Jayco-AlUla), Frank van den Broek (Picnic-PostNL), Hugo Houle (Israel-Premier Tech) and Tiesj Benoot (Visma-Lease a Bike) got away and got a gap.</p>\n<p>With 110km to go, the gap was up to 3:30, but the peloton never let them go on the rolling terrain. Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels and Tudor joined UAE Team Emirates-XRG at the front of the peloton, working for Vauquelin, Alaphilippe and Almeida, respectively.</p>\n<p>Vlasov was first to the summit of the Schw√§ndi climb as the peloton began to eat into their lead. Simmons won the first Tissot sprint, and Benoot won the second sprint, but the gap began to fall ominously. The views across Lake Zugersee were spectacular, but the racing was intense as the peloton reduced the gap to 2:00 with 70km to race.</p>\n<p>With 40km to go, the gap was down to 1:15 as the two late climbs loomed on the horizon. The B√ºrgenstock began with 23km to go and climbed for 5.5km at an average of 7.8%.</p>\n<p>The gap to the peloton was only 55 seconds, and so Simmons took off alone in search for a second breakaway victory. Behind, the peloton also blew apart after a Tudor acceleration, but Alaphilippe opted not to attack. However, the GC battle was suddenly on.</p>\n<p>Felix Gall (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) was keen to move up in the GC and surged up the climb. He was joined by Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) and Kevin Vauquelin (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) and a suffering Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p>Simmons had a chance of success but was suddenly called back to the chase group to work for GC leader Lennard K√§mna, who started the stage fifth overall.</p>\n<p>Ahead of them, a sextet formed on the descent, with Van den Broek there to work for Onley, while Gall, Vauquelin, Almeida, and Alaphilippe took advantage of Picnic&#8217;s excellent team tactics. The K√§mna group kept the gap to 20 seconds thanks to a huge job by Simmons, who tried to match Van den Broek&#8217;s work up front. There was so much to race for in the final 15km of the stage.</p>\n<p>The final Emmetten climb to the finish line was short at 3.9km but also steep at 8.1% with an early part at 12.7%. Simmons emptied himself in pursuit of the attacks, and so the K√§mna group started the climb with a gap of 25 seconds.</p>\n<p>Gall was the first to attack on the climb with three kilometres to go, spinning away from his GC rivals. The other attackers forced Almeida to lead the chase with only Onley giving him a few turns on the front. They knew Gall was not a direct GC threat. Behind Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AlUla) tried to chase, to limit his losses and stay in the top six overall.</p>\n<p>Almeida dragged the attackers up to Gall with a kilometre to go, and so the race for the stage victory and the bonus seconds began. Vauquelin attacked with ambition but was caught and passed by Almeida before the line.</p>\n<p>Vauquelin can only hope for a different result and so overall victory after Sunday&#8217;s 10km uphill time trial.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Florian Vermeersch (UAE Team Emirates) was third, a comparatively distant 16 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Hayter was one of the earliest starters in the flat, largely untechnical 9.7 kilometre course between Tessenderlo and Ham. During nearly two hours of waiting, barring Ganna nobody came close to challenging the 26-year-old Londoner&#8217;s blisteringly fast time of 10:30.</p>\n<p>Hayter will now go into Saturday&#8217;s crunch hilly stage in southern Belgium with a GC advantage of two seconds on second-placed Ganna, with Vermeersch lying third, 15 seconds down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while in the hot seat, you start getting quite nervous, but to win &#8211; it&#8217;s great,&#8221; Hayter said after managing to put a TT rival as prestigious as Ganna to the sword.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really nice to take my first win for the team, it&#8217;s not been my easiest start to the year but the team have been really patient with me and it&#8217;s nice to pay them back a bit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was quite a short TT, so we didn&#8217;t really have a plan. I went out quite fast, with a bit of tailwind on the climbs and then I went harder on the way back, all out to the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nOn a hot, dry day in central Belgium, former Swiss TT champion Joel Sutter (Tudor) became the first rider to break the glass ceiling of 11 minutes for the course with a time of 10:56, only for Czech Jozef ƒåzerny, (Soudal-QuickStep), also a former National TT Champion, to go two seconds better almost immediately afterwards.</p>\n<p>However, the best time was then set by some considerable distance by Hayter, whose five-second margin at the mid-stage checkpoint on ƒåzerny ballooned to a comparatively massive 25 seconds by the finish.</p>\n<p>This was admittedly a very fast course with some segments running through parkland and others switching to some broader highways, but globally the route always remained almost completely flat, with the weather conditions undoubtedly favouring some super-quick times, too. Yet no one, it seemed, could come close to Hayter&#8217;s time, clocked at a jaw-droppingly rapid average speed of 55.6kmh, with compatriot Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) remaining the next best placed on the provisional standings, over 18 seconds back, for the best part of an hour.</p>\n<p>Then when Swift was beaten, former U23 World Champion Filippo Baroncini (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was only a couple of seconds better, leaving Hayter in his dominating position.</p>\n<p>Some of the biggest hitters were still to come, though, given Hayter was the 56th starter of the 146 on the day. An outsider like Nils Eekhoff (Picnic-PostNL) proved to be just six seconds slower than Hayter at the mid-way check and GC contender Vermeersch (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was two seconds slower at the split, too. But both fell off the pace notably in the second half, leaving all eyes on the arch-favourite, Filippo Ganna as the one major obstacle between Hayter and victory.</p>\n<p>The multiple Italian National TT Champion and former double World TT Champion cruised down the start ramp with his usual faultlessly elegant style, near-perfect aerodynamic position and lightness of cadence all on display. No matter that this was his first race back since Paris-Roubaix in the sprint, from the get-go, the Ineos Grenadiers star was clearly on the road to challenging Hayter, and perhaps the 28th time trial victory of his glittering career as well.</p>\n<p>However, appearances proved deceptive, and Ganna too, was two seconds slower than Hayter at the split, ensuring, like everybody else, that only a strong turnaround in the second half could give him a chance of challenging Hayter. No matter how fast Ganna turned the pedals and how good he looked on the bike in terms of pure aesthetics, though, little by little Hayter&#8217;s advantage opened up further and further and by the time Ganna powered into the final kilometre it was obvious he would not be able &#8211; not yet, at least &#8211; to add a second win to his only triumph of 2025 to date, the opening stage of Tirreno-Adriatico.</p>\n<p>The final clutch of sprinters due to finish after Ganna all delivered respectable but not overly striking times, with race leader Juan Sebastian Molano (UAE Team Emirates) more concerned about making the time cut after puncturing on a right-hand bend and needing a replacement bike. Hayter&#8217;s victory was in the bag, then, and even if he fails to keep control overall between now and Brussels next Sunday, the psychological hurdle of taking his first win with his new team &#8211; and against Ganna to boot &#8211; has now been passed with flying colours.</p>\n<p>Hayter was cautiously optimistic about his chances on the next stage, the toughest of the entire race with nearly 3,000 metres of vertical climbing and which will take the riders on a very hilly trek through southern Belgium, starting and finishing on the short but steep Mur de Durbuy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is for me to defend the jersey, it&#8217;s a tricky stage but we&#8217;ll do our best&#8221; Hayter said. &#8220;Then another win on Sunday with Tim [Merlier, stage 1 winner and teammate] would be the best way to finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>It was heartbreak for the early breakaway on stage 6 of the Tour de Suisse, with three riders who spent more than 180km off the front being caught in the final kilometre by the sprint teams, with Jordi Meeus (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) powering to the victory in Neuhausen am Rheinfall.</p>\n<p>Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost) and Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) made up the break that almost made it, with the Swiss champion Schmid the last man standing after a valiant effort by the trio to try to stay ahead.</p>\n<p>Once caught, Lotto looked to have set things up nicely for Arnaud De Lie, but as the final corner and last 300 metres to the line approached, Danny van Poppel moved up Meeus at just the right moment, before leading him out perfectly to finish the job.</p>\n<p>Behind the Belgian, Davide Ballerini (XDS Astana) took second after teammate Alberto Bettiol committed a lot to chasing down the breakaway, with young Brit Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ) taking third.</p>\n<p>Yellow jersey K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) finished safely in the main peloton to maintain his overall lead on GC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was definitely a hard week for me so far, not really my most favourite terrain with all the hills and climbs.

They led the race through a brief journey into Liechtenstein.</p>\n<p>They quickly had more than a minute advantage, but more attacks came from the likes of Matej Mohoriƒç (Bahrain Victorious), Paul Lapeira (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Tom Gloag (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>None could bridge the gap, however, and at the 140km to go mark, the quartet in front had more than three minutes of an advantage over the chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>The only two categorised climbs of the day followed soon after the break formation, with the first to Wildhaus (9km at 6.8%) seeing Arnaud De Lie dropped and several others dropped off the back. They soon returned, but with the climb to Hemberg (6.2km at 5.7%) still to come.</p>\n<p>Mohoriƒç took his chance to attack away again, joined this time by teammate Pello Bilbao and Ewan Costiou (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), but they made no real dent into the lead of the four men in front, with the catch match to them around 30km later.</p>\n<p>With 80km to race, and the parcours in the second half of the stage being easier than the opening half, the sprint teams started to come to the fore, with Lotto, Picnic PostNL and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe working for De Lie, Pavel Bittner and Jordi Meeus, respectively.</p>\n<p>The gap was reduced quickly to 1:18, but Gr√©goire then stabilised things and sacrificed himself on the front for K√ºng, to give his teammate and the other two survivors of the early break a chance at the win. With 43km to go, the gap extended back out to 1:28.</p>\n<p>Into the final 30km of action, and the deficit for the peloton finally fell below one minute, with the trio in front more than capable of holding their own in a time trial, but starting to falter under the pressure applied by the sprint teams.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck joined the chasing effort, alongside Lotto, Red Bull, Picnic, and Tudor, helping reduce the gap further on the approach to Neuhausen am Rheinfall.</p>\n<p>The peloton had the trio in its sights with 15km to go, with the gap at 26 seconds, but the sprint teams had to commit a lot of firepower to try and wrestle back the final bit of the lead, with some hope yet for the early break.</p>\n<p>K√ºng, Schmid and Sweeny continued to work well together, holding a 20-second lead into the final 10km, as the trains behind continued to lose riders, but they were struggling to hold the high pace after almost 180km out in front.</p>\n<p>Crossing over the Rhine and into Schaffhausen allowed the trio to maintain their lead, but with 4km to go, it was only at 12 seconds, and it looked more and more like heartbreak was imminent for those in front.</p>\n<p>The catch was finally made just before the final kilometre to K√ºng and Sweeny by Tudor, after XDS Astana put in a big pull to bring them back. Schmid then gave one final push to try and snatch it, but the sprinting peloton was in full flow and quickly had him back in too.</p>\n<p>With the sprint now certain, Lotto tried to bring Belgian champion De Lie into the ideal position, which they did have momentarily, until Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe screamed up the left-hand side before the final bend to the line, washing out the Lotto sprinter and several others.</p>\n<p>Meeus had the momentum from Van Poppel&#8217;s top lead-out, holding his top speed all the way to the line ahead of Ballerini and Askey in Neuhausen am Rheinfall.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Merlier lies third overall, two seconds down, while Berckmoes is in fourth overall at five seconds down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 2 of the Baloise Belgium Tour would bring the peloton on another flat stage as riders tackled 194.4km from Beringen to Putte, including four laps of a closing circuit in the finishing town.</p>\n<p>With a fast start at a 50kph average speed, it would take almost 40km for the break of the day to jump away at the front.</p>\n<p>A six-man move went clear, with four Belgians, Alex Colman (Flanders-Baloise), Luca De Meester (Wagner Bazin WB), Maarten Verheyen (Baloise Glowi Lions), and Kenay De Moyer (Pauwels Sauzen-Cibel Clementines), joined by Dutch duo Marijn Maas (Beat Cycling Club) and Casper van der Woude (Metec-Solarwatt p/b Mantel).</p>\n<p>As Soudal-QuickStep settled into working at the head of the peloton on behalf of stage 1 winner and race leader Tim Merlier, the break raced up the road to a three-minute advantage.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck, working for Jasper Philipsen, also joined in the pacemaking, limited the six leaders to a two-minute advantage heading into the four laps of the finishing circuits.</p>\n<p>Just over 50km from the finish, following the 1km cobbled sector, the Peulisbaan, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Philipsen made a move at the front, splitting the peloton with around 30 riders breaking off at the front.</p>\n<p>Philipsen was joined by Merlier as well as GC hopefuls Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) and Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) as the lead group swallowed up the breakaway with 45km to run. Soon after, the chasing group came across too, bringing the entire peloton back together.</p>\n<p>Counter-attacks swiftly followed as Olivier Godfroid (Baloise Glowi Lions) and Axel van der Tuuk (Metec-Solarwatt p/b Mantel) went clear, taking a 10-second lead, with Wessel Mouris (Unibet Tietema Rockets) coming across later on at the 30km mark.</p>\n<p>By the penultimate passage through the finish line at 25km to go, just ahead of the golden kilometres, the trio had built a 40-second lead. The breakaway trio shared the bonus seconds among themselves at the three golden kilometre sprints, while back in the peloton, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Soudal-QuickStep continued to work in the chase.</p>\n<p>Other teams, including UAE Team Emirates-XRG also hit the front, while the trio out front continued with a 30-second lead heading into the final 10km. They hit the final run over the Peulisbaan, 7km out, with a 15-second advantage as Uno-X Mobility pulled behind.</p>\n<p>That gap swiftly evaporated, with the peloton making the catch and splitting once again 5km from home. Uno-X rider Adne Holter seized a chance to attack from the 40-man lead group a kilometre later.</p>\n<p>He was brought back at 2km to go, just as Ineos Grenadiers brought their man Ganna back to the front, ready for a full peloton to contest the final. Come the closing sprint, it was Molano who hit the front first. However, Philipsen got his timing right, jumping into the wind at the right moment to push past the Colombian and speed through for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Merlier lies third overall, two seconds down, while Berckmoes is in fourth overall at five seconds down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 2 of the Baloise Belgium Tour would bring the peloton on another flat stage as riders tackled 194.4km from Beringen to Putte, including four laps of a closing circuit in the finishing town.</p>\n<p>With a fast start at a 50kph average speed, it would take almost 40km for the break of the day to jump away at the front.</p>\n<p>A six-man move went clear, with four Belgians, Alex Colman (Flanders-Baloise), Luca De Meester (Wagner Bazin WB), Maarten Verheyen (Baloise Glowi Lions), and Kenay De Moyer (Pauwels Sauzen-Cibel Clementines), joined by Dutch duo Marijn Maas (Beat Cycling Club) and Casper van der Woude (Metec-Solarwatt p/b Mantel).</p>\n<p>As Soudal-QuickStep settled into working at the head of the peloton on behalf of stage 1 winner and race leader Tim Merlier, the break raced up the road to a three-minute advantage.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck, working for Jasper Philipsen, also joined in the pacemaking, limited the six leaders to a two-minute advantage heading into the four laps of the finishing circuits.</p>\n<p>Just over 50km from the finish, following the 1km cobbled sector, the Peulisbaan, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Philipsen made a move at the front, splitting the peloton with around 30 riders breaking off at the front.</p>\n<p>Philipsen was joined by Merlier as well as GC hopefuls Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) and Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek) as the lead group swallowed up the breakaway with 45km to run. Soon after, the chasing group came across too, bringing the entire peloton back together.</p>\n<p>Counter-attacks swiftly followed as Olivier Godfroid (Baloise Glowi Lions) and Axel van der Tuuk (Metec-Solarwatt p/b Mantel) went clear, taking a 10-second lead, with Wessel Mouris (Unibet Tietema Rockets) coming across later on at the 30km mark.</p>\n<p>By the penultimate passage through the finish line at 25km to go, just ahead of the golden kilometres, the trio had built a 40-second lead. The breakaway trio shared the bonus seconds among themselves at the three golden kilometre sprints, while back in the peloton, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Soudal-QuickStep continued to work in the chase.</p>\n<p>Other teams, including UAE Team Emirates-XRG also hit the front, while the trio out front continued with a 30-second lead heading into the final 10km. They hit the final run over the Peulisbaan, 7km out, with a 15-second advantage as Uno-X Mobility pulled behind.</p>\n<p>That gap swiftly evaporated, with the peloton making the catch and splitting once again 5km from home. Uno-X rider Adne Holter seized a chance to attack from the 40-man lead group a kilometre later.</p>\n<p>He was brought back at 2km to go, just as Ineos Grenadiers brought their man Ganna back to the front, ready for a full peloton to contest the final. Come the closing sprint, it was Molano who hit the front first. However, Philipsen got his timing right, jumping into the wind at the right moment to push past the Colombian and speed through for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=60&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) has won the toughest stage of the Tour de Suisse, with leading favourite Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) making major inroads in the overall, but K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) hanging on to oust compatriot Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) from the top spot on GC.</p>\n<p>In a breathtaking day of racing featuring a double ascent of the Cat.1 Castaneda with the summit finish two kilometres further on at Santa Maria in Calanca, Onley just outsprinted Almeida for the stage victory.</p>\n<p>Third was F√©lix Gall (Decathlon-AG2R), some 15 seconds back, with Vauquelin 40 seconds back.</p>\n<p>The overall battle will likely come down to Sunday&#8217;s final time trial, with Almeida poised to challenge, but Vauquelin moving into the lead for now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Definitely not at the start today,&#8221; Onley said when asked if he knew he could win the stage. &#8220;I knew I was in good shape and I was feeling good this week, but obviously with Almeida here, he&#8217;s been really strong so far and it wasn&#8217;t even guaranteed if the win would come from the bunch with a strong break up front, and not the strongest teams behind to chase. But I felt good all day, and then I just gave it a go on the last climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t win often, and I&#8217;ve had quite a few podiums this year so far, or quite close results, so to pull it off today is really nice for myself, and also for the team and my teammates, because they do a really good job every day, and today was no different, so it&#8217;s nice to be able to pay them back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Onley&#8217;s win moves him up to fourth overall, 1:21 down on new leader Vauquelin, but whilst Almeida missed out on the win, he remains the main beneficiary at the end of Thursday&#8217;s tough stage.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIt was an emotional start to the day for the Tour de Suisse at La Punt, as the race remembered Gino M√§der in the same town that two years ago had played host to the finish of the stage when he suffered a fatal crash on the nearby Albulapass. Before racing got underway on Thursday, a new memorial was unveiled in his honour on that climb.</p>\n<p>After a very aggressive start for a second day running, five riders were finally given the nod over the top of the first of four cat. 1 climbs, the Julienpass: Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost), in the break for the third day running, Javier Romo, Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana).</p>\n<p>Coming off the Julienpass, after a long descent, the quintet had a gap of just over two minutes and by the foot of the 7.5km Passo del San Bernadino, it had risen to just over three.</p>\n<p>Just as on stage 4, though, UAE were in no mood to give the other GC contenders a rest and they began piling on the pressure on the Bernadino at the front of a fast-crumbling peloton. It didn&#8217;t seem to matter that there was still 70 kilometres to go, the sight of three UAE riders driving away on the front ahead of Almeida in his black points leader jersey provided a serious shaking-out of the weaker riders, and by the summit the peloton had shrunk to just 50 riders or fewer.</p>\n<p>Vlasov claimed maximum points to ensure he was in the lead of the mountains ranking, and then the five leaders began the long, sweeping, but thankfully very well-surfaced descent to the crucial double climb of the Castaneda.</p>\n<p>With the pronounced acceleration by the UAE continuing, the five ahead were equally determined to stay out of reach, and all the way down to the valley floor past a series of ruined castles and reservoirs, the gap remained at two minutes. By the end of this 40 kilometre descent the bunch had gained a few elements but the overall dynamic of the stage &#8211; UAE chasing a very powerful breakaway of four &#8211; remained the same.</p>\n<p>Following the small section of flatter road prior to the crunch Castaneda ascent, with Fortunato leading the five onto its lower slopes, the gap was a mere 1:15 and the main question being asked was: how soon would Almeida attack? Given the shortness of the Castaneda, Mikkel Bjerg instantly opened up the throttle, shadowed by Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Tao Geoghegan Hart, the painfully narrow, steep series of switchbacks piled on top of each other in dense woodland, seemingly no obstacle.</p>\n<p>Two and a half kilometres from the top, Vlasov was the first to break the cooperation in the break, followed by Powless and Bilbao. But there was a power change in the peloton, though, as Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale, working for Felix Gall, briefly overhauled the UAE train.</p>\n<p>Decathlon&#8217;s surge put paid to race leader Romain Gr√©goire, who was dropped, while Powless and then Bilbao regained contact with Vlasov, but the margins were constantly narrowing. Finally, 400 metres to go on the climb, Almeida suddenly blasted to the fore, shrinking a group already down to just a dozen riders to a bare seven.</p>\n<p>By the summit, Vlasov and Bilbao were the only two ahead of the Almeida group by around 14 seconds, which still contained second on GC K√©vin Vauquelin and Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor), as well as Gall, Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep), Oscar Onley, and Matthew Riccitello (Israel-Premier Tech). But rivals of the calibre of Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AIUla) were already missing and, of course, Gr√©goire, by now was nearly 2:00 back, his lead irremediably lost.</p>\n<p>Bilbao blasted down the fast, much more straightforward descent, with Vlasov shadowing him, and finally Powless. But the chase group was swelling too, allowing Vauquelin&#8217;s troops to regain contact and finally with nine kilometres to go the breakaways were caught.</p>\n<p>The front group of around a dozen riders were rapidly reduced by Decathlon&#8217;s pace on the lower slopes, once again forcing O&#8217;Connor out of the running. However, rather than the first decisive attack coming from Almeida, Alaphilippe opened up hostilities, followed by Onley, and Almeida began to drop back.</p>\n<p>Onley then went clear three kilometres from the line, but Almeida began his customary late surge, roaring past one rider after another and reaching Onley less than a kilometre later. Moving through the inside of a left hand curve, Almeida piled on the pressure remorselessly, leading Onley over the summit and onto the final, much shorter ascent.</p>\n<p>Keen to take as much time as possible, Almeida didn&#8217;t ask Onley for a turn, meaning the Portuguese rider did the bulk of the work in the finale. Then, in the final 300m, Onley launched his sprint first, and Almeida couldn&#8217;t quite match him ‚Äì a late acceleration saw him push the Scot to the line, but Onley just held on to claim only his second pro victory.</p>\n<p>Gall took third, 23 seconds down, whilst Vauquelin came home 57 seconds down but enough to claim the race lead. Yellow jersey at the start of the day, Romain Gr√©goire had a torrid day, eventually finishing nearly seven minutes down and saying goodbye to his stint in the lead. Alaphilippe moved up to second overall, 29 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Though Vauquelin leads, Almeida is very much back in the GC in this race after losing time early on, sitting just 39 seconds off the lead with two road stages and a time trial still to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) began to turn the tide on stage 4 of the Tour de Suisse with a 49-kilometre solo victory, mounting the first part of his GC comeback on the mountainous route into Piuro, Italy.</p>\n<p>The Portuguese rider was led out on the Spl√ºgenpass climb, with his UAE team mopping up the remnants of the breakaway, before Jan Christen provided two final turns and Almeida pushed on alone, increasing the pressure.</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t blast away from his rivals, but gradually rode them off the wheel with 1.8km of the category 1 climb remaining. Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL) and Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) were the last two to get dropped.</p>\n<p>With most of the final 50km being on downhill roads, Almeida worked well to maintain a gap to the line. His GC rivals&#8217; failure to cooperate behind allowed him to stay out in front over the final drag up to the line, with an eventual winning margin of 40 seconds to Onley and O&#8217;Connor, who attacked together from the chase group in the final 7km.</p>\n<p>Pre-stage race leader Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) was dropped on the 8.8km climb, but fought back valiantly on the descent to catch the main chase group that contained the likes of K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), his closest competitor on GC at the start.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman kept hold of the yellow jersey, albeit losing a 1:10 to Almeida at the line ahead of another tough mountain stage on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Despite the big gain, Almeida&#8217;s poor start to the race, when he lost more than three minutes on stage 1, leaves him with a 2:07 deficit still to make up to Gr√©goire on the final four stages, if he is to defend UAE&#8217;s title in Switzerland.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard effort, really good teamwork, and it&#8217;s nice to finish it off,&#8221; said Almeida, who wasn&#8217;t so bullish on a GC fightback, but will certainly be on the attack again on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, there&#8217;s still a long way to go, a lot of time to get back, but I&#8217;m happy with the stage win and we will go and enjoy this one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to disagree [on being the favourite now], because for me, it&#8217;s up to me to take time back and it&#8217;s going to be a super hard task, but we never give up. Well, I need to try; if I don&#8217;t try, we will never know.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With a brutal stage to Santa Maria in Calanca awaiting the riders tomorrow, Almeida will be looking for a similarly big gain. Vauquelin needs just 25 seconds on his compatriot to take over the lead, while O&#8217;Connor sits well-placed thanks to his stage 4 gain, with just 56 seconds now separating him and the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAction on stage 4 of the Tour de Suisse started before the racing kicked off, with Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) pulling out as a precaution after his crash the day before.</p>\n<p>Once normal proceedings were underway, the start in Heiden was followed by an attacking opening fight for the breakaway, with a slightly strange 193.2km route on offer. The highlight of the route was the two categorised climbs that formed one long climbing effort to the category 1 Spl√ºgenpass.</p>\n<p>The likes of Anthon Charmig (XDS Astana) and Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) tried unsuccessfully to get away, but Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) found more joy when he peeled off the front after 45 minutes of rapid racing.</p>\n<p>That move fizzled out, though, as did one from Fabio Van Den Bossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck), with average speed in the peloton north of 50 kph for the opening hour.</p>\n<p>A three-man move saw the beginnings of the day&#8217;s break forming, with AJ August (Ineos Grenadiers), Georg Zimmermann (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Larry Warbasse (Tudor Pro Cycling) getting up the road ahead of a feed zone.</p>\n<p>Five more riders then formed a chase group and eventually made contact with those in front with 104km to go: Powless, Tom Gloag (Visma-Lease a Bike), S√©bastien Grignard (Lotto), Marius Mayrhofer (Tudor Pro Cycling) and yesterday&#8217;s stage winner Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>The eight-man group&#8217;s lead went out as far as 2:45, but Groupama-FDJ and Picnic PostNL were among those who worked on the front to keep things close on stage 4.</p>\n<p>As they climbed to Sufers and approached the 8.8km Spl√ºgenpass with its average gradient of 7.4%, the break split, with the stronger climbers going ahead. Grignard, Warbasse, Mayrhofer and Zimmermann were all dropped by the time the leading quartet reached 63km to go.</p>\n<p>Simmons, Gloag and Powless powered on, leaving their fellow anglophone August behind, but the fragmented peloton was closing in quickly, only 16 seconds behind the leader 54km from the finish.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG pushed on aggressively, looking to both help Felix Gro√üschartner&#8217;s ambitions, but also launch Jo√£o Almeida back up the overall standings after his disappointing opening stage. This ended the breakaway&#8217;s day in front, with 6km of the climb still to race.</p>\n<p>Almeida was left on his own when Jan Christen ran out of steam after a second bout of pacing, but soon the Portuguese rider proved why he was the pre-race GC favourite.</p>\n<p>As he put the hammer down, Gall, Onley and O&#8217;Connor tried to hang with him, but dropped quickly under his tempo. With 49km to go, Almeida was solo but far from out of danger, thanks to the 35km of descending that he would be faced with after reaching the crest.</p>\n<p>Almeida started the 47km run for home with a 40-second lead over the main eight-rider chase group of GC rivals, with Gr√©goire at 1:21 over the top. A blessing for the young Frenchman, however, was that he had one of the best descenders in the world with him for company ‚Äì Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor).</p>\n<p>Vauquelin went into the virtual lead of the race at times on the downhill, having started the day just 25 seconds back, even trying to attack on the descent with O&#8217;Connor, but contact was then made by the man in yellow.</p>\n<p>Into the valley, and everything was back together behind, with 13km to go. The 11 riders now in pursuit of only Almeida didn&#8217;t cooperate, though, despite being within touching distance of Almeida at 38 seconds.</p>\n<p>It became clear he was going to win, with the gap stabilising to 40 seconds at the line for the UAE rider, with Onley and O&#8217;Connor being prompted into a late tandem attack to try and make time on those failing to work behind, which worked.</p>\n<p>Gr√©goire survived for another day in yellow, finishing fifth on the day behind Vauquelin in the second chase group, with Almeida not yet being an immediate threat to his GC lead, but the Brit and Australian did take back 26 and 22 seconds respectively on his lead, with Almeida getting 1:10 back thanks to his bonus seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The 11 riders now in pursuit of only Almeida didn&#8217;t cooperate, though, despite being within touching distance of Almeida at 38 seconds.</p>\n<p>It became clear he was going to win, with the gap stabilising to 40 seconds at the line for the UAE rider, with Onley and O&#8217;Connor being prompted into a late tandem attack to try and make time on those failing to work behind, which worked.</p>\n<p>Gr√©goire survived for another day in yellow, finishing fifth on the day behind Vauquelin in the second chase group, with Almeida not yet being an immediate threat to his GC lead, but the Brit and Australian did take back 26 and 22 seconds respectively on his lead, with Almeida getting 1:10 back thanks to his bonus seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He opened a 30-second gap and fought to keep it all the way to the finish line in the hilltop spa resort of Heiden.</p>\n<p>The peloton looked at each other to lead the chase, and Simmons had time to celebrate his first victory since taking the stars and stripes in May.</p>\n<p>Simmons waved his arms, his victory perhaps securing him a place in the Lidl-Trek Tour de France squad.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Tram Emirates-XRG) led home the peloton, ahead of Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL), but they were 18 seconds behind Simmons.</p>\n<p>Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) finished fourth and so kept his race leader&#8217;s yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>Simmons pointed to the sky to remember Gino M√§der, who died at the Tour de Suisse two years ago. Simmons was riding behind M√§der when he crashed and was deeply affected by this death.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The motivation was super high today.

I did a day late,&#8221; Simmons explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard being here for me and seeing his mum at the start. Now I can pay my tribute, and for sure, I had extra motivation for today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Simmons remembered M√§der and also celebrated his first win as US national champion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first part of my celebration was for me, my jersey. The last time I was in this jersey, I never won a bike race and had a terrible season. That was a huge motivation to win in the American champion&#8217;s jersey. I&#8217;m not sure that last happened at WorldTour level. The final gesture was to dedicate it to Gino.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 195km stage from Aarau to Heiden was another rolling ride through the Swiss hills, this time east towards Lake Constance and Liechtenstein.</p>\n<p>The roads offered another great chance for the breakaway, and riders attacked as soon as the flag was dropped.</p>\n<p>The early break formed after a counter-attack, with Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), Nans Peters (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost) and Emiel Verstrynge (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Brent Van Moer (Lotto) and Samuele Battistella (EF Education-EasyPost) surging away.</p>\n<p>The peloton eased, and suddenly they had a 1:40 lead after 15km. Groupama-FDJ took up the chase on the front of the peloton for stage 1 winner and yellow jersey wearer Gr√©goire.</p>\n<p>The stage passed north of Z√ºrich, the host of last year&#8217;s World Championships, and then Winterthur, where the men&#8217;s road race began. In a sense of pride, Tudor also helped Groupama-FDJ with the work on the front of the peloton, ensuring the sextet never extended their lead beyond 2:30. Indeed, the chase soon reduced the gap to 1:20 with 100km to race.</p>\n<p>The second half of the stage was far hillier than the first half, with the categorised climbs in the final 40km. That sparked a new wave of tactics and desire to win the stage, with Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), Alessandor Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), James Knox (Soudal-QuickStep) and Marco Haller (Tudor) forming a counter-attack. It was a good move, but the peloton soon closed them down.</p>\n<p>The speed eased, and so the breakaway extended their lead once again. A crash in the feed zone also slowed the peloton. Junior Lecerf (Soudal-QuickStep) and stage 2 runner-up Fabio Christen (Q36.5) went down and were battered and bruised as they chased back onto the split peloton. Sadly, Knox soon abandoned the race.</p>\n<p>With 60km to go, another crash happened, this time for Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers). The former Tour de France winner went down as the peloton turned a sharp left at a slow speed. Thomas seemed to twist his left knee or ankle and was clearly in pain as he sat on the road.</p>\n<p>The Welshman eventually got going and visited the race doctor&#8217;s car. However, he lost considerable time and was forced to chase the peloton.</p>\n<p>Lucas Hamilton and other teammates soon dropped back to help him, but the peloton was strung out and often in the hills, making it a tough task for Thomas and his Ineos. Thomas was still chasing with 25km to go as he tried to move up through the team cars.</p>\n<p>The break rode through the intermediate sprint in Hundwil with 40km to go, with the toughest climbs looming. Max Walker was the first to be dropped from the break, followed by Peters. Simmons was clearly targeting the stage victory and was keen to hurt his breakaway companions with huge turns on the front.</p>\n<p>Only Simmons, Van Moer, Verstrynge and Battistella were left up front as UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Decathlon AG2R joined the chase and reduced the gap to 1:00.</p>\n<p>After a fast descent off the plateau, the 5.1km Knolhusen climb began, and so too did the finale, making it even harder for Thomas to catch the peloton. Ahead of him, the attackers had just a 30-second advantage.</p>\n<p>Simmons soon surged away on the climb, making a huge solo effort, but he was the hare for the peloton to chase. Verstrynge, Battistella and Van Moer were soon caught by the peloton over the top of the climb, but Simmons was on a mission to gain as much time as he could. He had a lead of 30 seconds as he started the B√ºriswilen climb with 10km to go and refused to give in.</p>\n<p>The peloton exploded when Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) jumped away. He was caught and passed by Juanpa Lopez (Lidl-Trek), as other riders waited for the final climb to the finish and looked at each other to lead the chase.</p>\n<p>Simmons pushed on as the gradient eased and the road descended. The US national champion took risks on the corners but kept his 30-second advantage.</p>\n<p>Nielsen Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) tried a solo counter-attack and got a gap on the peloton, but both had left it too late to close down Simmons, who flew to a deserved victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Vincenzo Albanese (EF Education-EasyPost) powered to victory in a tricky uphill sprint on stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse, timing his charge for the line perfectly in Schwarzsee ahead of Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) and Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ).</p>\n<p>The finale was kicked off 2.5km from the line by Swiss rider Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) trying to go solo on home roads. As he ran out of steam, US national champion Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) tried to steal a march entering the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Simmons was marked by Askey as Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) failed to respond, with Albanese in the Brit&#8217;s wheel, and entering the final 200 metres, no one could match the Italians power, with Christen boxed in.</p>\n<p>This is by far Albanese&#8217;s career-best win, coming at 28, three years after his last at the Tour du Limousin.</p>\n<p>Finishing 21st in the main bunch, Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) held onto the overall lead of the race, thanks to his stage 1 win, and extended his advantage to K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) by sprinting to one bonus second at the first Tissot sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first victory in WorldTour, and at this fantastic race in Switzerland, and I&#8217;m very, very happy. I say thank you to all my team, it was a fantastic job in the kilometre,&#8221; said a delighted Albanese, who confirmed he was meant to be a lead-out man on stage 2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good from the start, and my role today was to lead-out [Madis] Mihkels, but in the last kilometre, [Quinn] Simmons and some others attacked and I followed. Then I saw 200m to the finish and I went full until the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the chaotic racing and rain of the opener, Stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse opened up in Aarau to sunny skies and a mood of remembrance, with it marking two years since the devastating passing of Gino M√§der at his home race.</p>\n<p>Heading southwest, the 149 remaining riders kicked into action from the flag drop, with attacks being launched and a three-man move eventually getting up the road in the opening phase of the 177km route to Schwarzsee.</p>\n<p>Two Swiss riders, Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) and Silvan Dillier (Alpecin-Deceuninck) found themselves in the break, alongside Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and they were allowed to build a lead of more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>Despite a far from flat parcours being on offer, with uphill roads punctuating the final 65km of the stage, two of the teams with sprinters, Picnic PostNL and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, came to the fore to control.</p>\n<p>They kept the gap tight, down at 1:30 for the majority of the day, working for Pavel Bittner and Jordi Meeus respectively.</p>\n<p>Dillier was dropped on the first categorised climb to Guggisberg with 55km remaining on the day, and his two fellow escapees saw their advantage drop below 40 seconds, as Tudor began pacing on the steep climb to Heitenried, with Marc Hirschi and Julian Alaphilippe working. This pace also dropped Meeus.</p>\n<p>The Tissot bonus sprints brought some aggressive action, with Gregoire nabbing one bonus second at the first, and Felix Engelhardt (Jayco AlUla) getting the same prize at the second, with the breakaway duo still in front.</p>\n<p>Schmid proved stronger than Rutsch and left him with 17km to go onthe final categorised climb to Rechthalten, with Lidl-Trek, Picnic and Jayco now helping to decrease the break&#8217;s gap to less than 15 seconds. He too was caught 2km later, after Fabio Van den Bossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck) tried to attack.</p>\n<p>With a sprint now looking imminent, EF Education-EasyPost took over on the front of the peloton as the tricky uphill finale began to unfold.</p>\n<p>Jan Christen burst the finale into life 2.5km from the line, attacking solo with bandages on his elbow and knee after a tough fall yesterday.</p>\n<p>As he faded, Quinn Simmons tried an final kilometre attack, which Alaphilippe failed to follow, forcing Askey to waste energy closing the gap.</p>\n<p>Albanese then took the quickest line to the finish inside the final 200 metres, legally boxing Fabio Christen out of contention, with neither Askey or Simmons able to mount any more challenge in third and fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Vincenzo Albanese (EF Education-EasyPost) powered to victory in a tricky uphill sprint on stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse, timing his charge for the line perfectly in Schwarzsee ahead of Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) and Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ).</p>\n<p>The finale was kicked off 2.5km from the line by Swiss rider Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) trying to go solo on home roads. As he ran out of steam, US national champion Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) tried to steal a march entering the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Simmons was marked by Askey as Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling) failed to respond, with Albanese in the Brit&#8217;s wheel, and entering the final 200 metres, no one could match the Italians power, with Christen boxed in.</p>\n<p>This is by far Albanese&#8217;s career-best win, coming at 28, three years after his last at the Tour du Limousin.</p>\n<p>Finishing 21st in the main bunch, Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) held onto the overall lead of the race, thanks to his stage 1 win, and extended his advantage to K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) by sprinting to one bonus second at the first Tissot sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first victory in WorldTour, and at this fantastic race in Switzerland, and I&#8217;m very, very happy. I say thank you to all my team, it was a fantastic job in the kilometre,&#8221; said a delighted Albanese, who confirmed he was meant to be a lead-out man on stage 2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good from the start, and my role today was to lead-out [Madis] Mihkels, but in the last kilometre, [Quinn] Simmons and some others attacked and I followed. Then I saw 200m to the finish and I went full until the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the chaotic racing and rain of the opener, Stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse opened up in Aarau to sunny skies and a mood of remembrance, with it marking two years since the devastating passing of Gino M√§der at his home race.</p>\n<p>Heading southwest, the 149 remaining riders kicked into action from the flag drop, with attacks being launched and a three-man move eventually getting up the road in the opening phase of the 177km route to Schwarzsee.</p>\n<p>Two Swiss riders, Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) and Silvan Dillier (Alpecin-Deceuninck) found themselves in the break, alongside Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and they were allowed to build a lead of more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>Despite a far from flat parcours being on offer, with uphill roads punctuating the final 65km of the stage, two of the teams with sprinters, Picnic PostNL and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, came to the fore to control.</p>\n<p>They kept the gap tight, down at 1:30 for the majority of the day, working for Pavel Bittner and Jordi Meeus respectively.</p>\n<p>Dillier was dropped on the first categorised climb to Guggisberg with 55km remaining on the day, and his two fellow escapees saw their advantage drop below 40 seconds, as Tudor began pacing on the steep climb to Heitenried, with Marc Hirschi and Julian Alaphilippe working. This pace also dropped Meeus.</p>\n<p>The Tissot bonus sprints brought some aggressive action, with Gregoire nabbing one bonus second at the first, and Felix Engelhardt (Jayco AlUla) getting the same prize at the second, with the breakaway duo still in front.</p>\n<p>Schmid proved stronger than Rutsch and left him with 17km to go onthe final categorised climb to Rechthalten, with Lidl-Trek, Picnic and Jayco now helping to decrease the break&#8217;s gap to less than 15 seconds. He too was caught 2km later, after Fabio Van den Bossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck) tried to attack.</p>\n<p>With a sprint now looking imminent, EF Education-EasyPost took over on the front of the peloton as the tricky uphill finale began to unfold.</p>\n<p>Jan Christen burst the finale into life 2.5km from the line, attacking solo with bandages on his elbow and knee after a tough fall yesterday.</p>\n<p>As he faded, Quinn Simmons tried an final kilometre attack, which Alaphilippe failed to follow, forcing Askey to waste energy closing the gap.</p>\n<p>Albanese then took the quickest line to the finish inside the final 200 metres, legally boxing Fabio Christen out of contention, with neither Askey or Simmons able to mount any more challenge in third and fourth.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) claimed the biggest win of his young career to date on the final stage of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, triumphing from the early breakaway with an 8km solo move up the day&#8217;s, and the race&#8217;s, final climb.</p>\n<p>34 seconds behind the Frenchman, the general classification was confirmed as Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) crossed the finish line together, the Dane unable to detach his great rival on the way up.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar duly sealed the overall race victory, his first at the Dauphin√©, having defended his sizeable lead without much difficulty over 3,500 metres of climbing spread across the final day.</p>\n<p>He takes the win by 59 seconds over Vingegaard, while Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) rounds out the podium at 2:38 down, having shed seven seconds to Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quickstep) at the line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A really amazing week. Once again today great job by the team and they&#8217;ve managed to defend the jersey. We can go home happy to prepare for the Tour,&#8221; Pogaƒçar said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of positives and all the negatives will turn into positives so it&#8217;s all good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We go to altitude camp at Isola 2000, then three days home, and to the Tour. There&#8217;s basically not too much to do. Rest after this great week, do some extra work on the time trial, maybe, and then I&#8217;m ready.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been here in 2020 at the shortened Dauphin√© because of COVID times. It was one of the hardest five days I ever did in my career, and since then, I didn&#8217;t return. Finally, I did it and I&#8217;m super happy and proud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar takes home the yellow and green jerseys as overall and points classification champion.</p>\n<p>Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) wins the polka dot mountain classification jersey courtest of a final-stage breakaway raid, while Lipowitz wins the white of best young rider.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© took the peloton into the mountains for one last time with six climbs lying between the remaining riders and the finish line, including first-category tests of the Col de Beaune (6.6km at 6.8%) 66km from the end, and the Col du Mont-Cenis (9.6km at 6.9%) 5km out.</p>\n<p>Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) were the first attackers of the day, going clear on the early third-category C√¥te d&#8217;Aiton. The pair were quickly caught, but Van der Poel went again on the next climb, the second-category C√¥te de Saint-Georges-d&#8217;Hurti√®res, after 15km of racing.</p>\n<p>He took a small group of riders with him during the second move, but they too were caught before a larger group went clear after the climb. Van der Poel bridged across to the selection of riders, which included Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), Alexey Lutsenko (Israel-Premier Tech), Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease A Bike), Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep), Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers), and stage 3 winner Iv√°n Romeo plus his Movistar teammate Enric Mas.</p>\n<p>The move was left to ride clear, gaining three minutes on the peloton on the flat roads heading to the Col de Beaune. Several of their number, including bridging rider Jake Stewart (Groupama-FDJ) dropped on the way up, but Van der Poel stood firm among the group full of climbers.</p>\n<p>Bruno Armirail moved into the virtual mountain classification lead on the way, grabbing KOM points over two of the first three climbs. At the intermediate sprint following the descent, Van der Poel pushed on, grabbing those points but not slowing up after he had distanced the remainder of the break.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, Uno-X Mobility were doing the work on the front to limit the break&#8217;s advantage under three minutes. Up the road, Van der Poel had set off on a solo odyssey with a mammoth 58km left to run.</p>\n<p>He lead the way over the next climb, the third-category C√¥te de Saint-Andr√©, with a minute over the break and 45km remaining. The following second-category C√¥te de Aussois (6.3km at 6.2%) would pose a tougher challenge, but he continued on, 1:10 up on the break and 2:40 ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Aside from the short descent to follow, much of the remaining kilometres pointed uphill, including that final test of the Col du Mont-Cenis. The peloton was closing in, but only gradually. At the 25km to go marker, Van der Poel still held a 2:20 advantage.</p>\n<p>5km later, he had only shed 20 seconds to reduced peloton, still led by Uno-X. Of greater concern for the lone leader, though, was the remains of the breakaway, 10 of whom had come together in working to chase Van der Poel down.</p>\n<p>The seconds ebbed away as the kilometres ticked down, before the larger group made contact with the Dutchman in the green jersey 16km from the finish. The climb to Mont-Cenis loomed, and it was an ascent too far for Van der Poel, who swiftly went out the back of the group containing Kuss, Van Gils, Foss, Romeo, Martinez, Healy, Mas, Paret-Peintre, Armirail, and Lutsenko.</p>\n<p>The climbers wouldn&#8217;t stay together for long either, however. The early slopes of the Dauphin√©&#8217;s final climb saw Kuss, Van Gils, Martinez, Healy, Mas, and Paret-Peintre come to the forefront.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;d lead the race towards the final 10km, though by that point Martinez and Mas had leapt away at the front, with Healy leading the chase. 1:40 down the mountain, the peloton lurked,</p>\n<p>The GC group ‚Äì Wellens with Pogaƒçar, Jorgenson and Tulett with Vingegaard, plus Lipowitz, Evenepoel, Carlos Rodr√≠guez, Tobias Halland Johannessen, and Guillaume Martin ‚Äì closed in as the top of the mountain neared, passing the breakaway men as they did.</p>\n<p>At 7km to go, just four GC men remained, with Pogaƒçar joined by Vingegaard, Evenepoel and Johannessen at 55 seconds behind Martinez, who had jumped to leave Mas behind a kilometre earlier.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman was on his way to a big victory, but behind him Vingegaard was making one last push, accelerating away from Evenepoel and Johannessen but, crucially, not Pogaƒçar. The duo pushed back the last survivors of the break ‚Äì Healy, Kuss, Mas ‚Äì but Martinez remained in front, and neither man in yellow could be separated.</p>\n<p>After Martinez crested the summit, the flatter road of the stage&#8217;s final 5km reassured him that the win was in the bag. He hit the final kilometre with 30 seconds in hand over Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, leaving him with time to celebrate his second WorldTour victory.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Pogaƒçar lead-out the two-man sprint for second place. There was no sprint in the end, however, with the champion offering no resistance as Vingegaard started and aborted a full-on sprint for the placing.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He hit the final kilometre with 30 seconds in hand over Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, leaving him with time to celebrate his second WorldTour victory.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Pogaƒçar lead-out the two-man sprint for second place. There was no sprint in the end, however, with the champion offering no resistance as Vingegaard started and aborted a full-on sprint for the placing.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the event covers two weekends in June, and along with the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, it is considered a proving ground for the Tour de France, which is on the calendar approximately two weeks after the end of the Tour de Suisse. Since 2011 the event is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional races.</p>\n<p>Romain Gr√©goire showcased his exceptional descending skills on the wet descent from the Michaelskreuzstrasse climb to win Stage 1 of the Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman broke away from a splintered breakaway and managed to hold off the chasing trio of Kevin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Bart Lemmen (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), and Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) to secure a standout victory.</p>\n<p>Crossing the line 20 seconds later, Vauquelin claimed second in a three-up sprint ahead of Lemmen who was third. Alaphilippe finished fourth.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s always something really special to win at the WorldTour level so I&#8217;m really, really happy,‚Äù said Gr√©goire (22) who claimed his first WorldTour victory last year at the Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think we were at the same level with Kevin, Bart and Julian, but I made a difference in the technical part.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The quarter was part of a 29-rider breakaway which escaped with 86km to go, after non-stop attacking peppered the front of the peloton as they tackled a hilly loop. The move also included GC contender Ben O‚ÄôConnor and two Jayco-AlUla teammates, who did the majority of the work to stretch the gap to over the three-minute mark.</p>\n<p>O‚ÄôConnor took over the pacemaking at the front on the final climb but was soon swamped by the quartet battling for the stage honours. The Australian led the second chase group to take fifth place, 1:07 down.</p>\n<p>Gr√©goire takes the first leader‚Äôs jersey with a 24-second lead on Vauquelin, 26 seconds on Lemmen.</p>\n<p>O‚ÄôConnor sits in fifth overall, at 1:17 down, while the rest of the pre-race favourites, including Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) are 3:22 down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nInstead of starting with the usual prologue, the Tour de Suisse with a 127.2 km Stage 1 around K√ºssnacht, where the men took on the same route as the final stage of the Tour de Suisse Women.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 featured two distinct loops: one flat and one hilly, incorporating the climbs of Adligenwilerstrasse and Michaelskreuzstrasse. The peloton first tackled the challenging hilly circuit, followed by the flatter loop running along Lakes Zug, Lauerz, and Luzern. A final return to the hilly loop, with the steep Michaelskreuzstrasse climb just 15 km from the finish, set the stage for a dynamic and decisive finale.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from the start of the relatively short stage, with splits appearing in the peloton early on the Adligenswilerstrasse climb with Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) cresting first to take the first KOM points of the day ahead of Valentin Madouas (Groupama-FDJ) and Tom Gloag (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>A solo crash took down Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) as the peloton reformed. The 22-year-old Swiss rider was able to rejoin and was seen later on getting some assistance at his team car.</p>\n<p>Felix Engelhardt (Jayco-AlUla) and Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) launched an attack on the approach to the Michaelskreuzstrasse climb, opening up a gap of roughly 22 seconds on a large chase group, as splits continued to pepper the peloton.</p>\n<p>A 27-rider chase group formed and had the two escapees within sight, just 10 seconds ahead as they crossed the finish line to begin the flatter loop.</p>\n<p>The 29-rider breakaway included Felix Gro√üschartner (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Sam Maisonobe (Cofidis), Beno√Æt Cosnefroy (Decathlon AG2r La Mondiale), Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ), Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Warren Barguil (Picnic-PostNL), and Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p>Also in the move were teammates Ewen Costiou, Mathis Le Berre and Kevin Vauquelin (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels); Matej Mohoriƒç and Rainer Kepplinger (Bahrain Victorious); Lennard K√§mna and Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek); Castrillo and William Barta (Movistar); Luke Durbridge, Engelhardt and Ben O¬¥Connor (Jayco-AlUla); Tijmen Graat and Bart Lemmen (Visma-Lease a Bike); Nicola Conci and Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana); Georg Zimmermann and Simone Petilli (Intermarch√© Wanty); George Bennett and Hugo Houle (Israel-Premier Tech); and Matteo Badilatti and Sjoerd Bax (Q36.5).</p>\n<p>With dark clouds looming overhead, the peloton led by UAE Team Emirates-XRG, Ineos Grenadiers, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, Soudal-QuickStep, and Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale, worked hard to keep the break, which included GC danger men O‚ÄôConnor, Gr√©goire, and Castrillo, on a tight leash.</p>\n<p>In the break, O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs teammates put in massive pulls to stretch the gap as much as possible, hitting a maximum of 3:40 with 56km to go.</p>\n<p>The storm rolled in with torrential rain, darkening skies, and flashes of lightning in the distance, as the breakaway pressed on with 46 km to go. A few riders, including Fortunato and U.S.A. champion Simmons, went down on the wet roads but quickly jumped to chase back into the lead group.</p>\n<p>As they crossed the finish line once more to start the hilly loop for the second time, the gap was 3:25 inside of 40km remaining.</p>\n<p>In the fight for bonus seconds in the Tissot kilometre sprints, Swift claimed the first sprint ahead of Alaphilippe and Castrillo, while Simmons took the second ahead of Alaphilippe and Swift. As a result, both Alaphilippe and Swift earned four-second time bonuses, Simmons picked up three seconds, and Castrillo nabbed one.</p>\n<p>The gap fell to under the three-minute mark, as the break took on the ascent of Adligenswilerstrasse for the second time, with Engelhardt taking top KOM ahead of Mohoriƒç and O‚ÄôConnor.</p>\n<p>Mohoriƒç was the first to fall off the Jayco-driven pace in the break on the Michaelskreuzstrasse climb, followed by Le Berre, Kepplinger, and Simmons as the gap hovered around 2:45..</p>\n<p>Riders continued to fall off as O‚ÄôConnor took over the pacemaking, trying to make it as difficult as possible for his breakaway companions with 16km to go. But the Australian is swamped before the top of the climb with Lemmen launching a move, quickly covered by Vauquelin, Gr√©goire and Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p>Gr√©goire pushed on, opening up a small advantage on the wet descent, getting seven seconds to Vauquelin, Lemmen and Alaphilippe, and 25 seconds to a second four-rider chase group with 9km to go.</p>\n<p>Going all in as the rain continued to pour, Gr√©goire stretched the gap out to 13 seconds with 2km to go, a gap he was able to build on to take the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) has won the 2025 Tour de Suisse Women. Wearing the yellow jersey since her stage 1 victory, the 33-year-old Swiss allrounder won the final stage to seal her GC victory.</p>\n<p>Reusser set the pace on the final climb, the steep Michaelskreuzstrasse, then attacked after the descent with 9.5km to go and soloed to the finish to conclude a big stage race win in style.</p>\n<p>28 seconds down, Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) beat Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) in the sprint for second place, but Vollering finishes overall runner-up, 36 seconds down, ahead of Niewiadoma-Phinney, who finishes 1:56 off Reusser.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great, I&#8217;m really, really, really happy,&#8221; Reusser said after the finish.</p>\n<p>Having missed much of the 2024 season due to post-Covid syndrome, Reusser is now back at the top and prefers to focus on the here and now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just back in life and super happy. On a day like today, I don&#8217;t think about last year. I just enjoy this day, and I really enjoyed the race. I enjoyed the crowd, I was very impressed how many people we had at the side of the road, I heard my name and encouragement all over the place, it was really, really nice,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>More and more, Reusser is emerging as the top challenger for Vollering.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we have this rivalry the whole year, and I&#8217;m just making so many steps at this moment, I&#8217;m really levelling up a lot, and I think it will keep being interesting,&#8221; finished Reusser.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 129.4km stage starting and finishing in K√ºssnacht began with a circuit that included the climbs of the Adligenwilerstrasse and Michaelskreuzstrasse followed by a mainly-flat loop alongside Lake Zug, Lake Lauerz and Lake Luzern before finishing with another lap of the Adligenwilerstrasse and Michaelskreuzstrasse.</p>\n<p>Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) led the peloton over the first Adligenwilerstrasse QOM, and this would eventually be enough to win her the red mountain jersey. Afterwards, a break of five riders got away, but only Afghan champion Fariba Hashimi (Ceratizit) was left at the front at the top of the steep Michaelskreuzstrasse, less than 30 seconds ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>After Hashimi was caught, 11 riders briefly formed a new front group, then Mikayla Harvey (SD Worx-Protime) and Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) held a five-second gap for about ten kilometres.</p>\n<p>Henrietta Christie (EF Education-Oatly) attacked with 64km to go and quickly built a 55-second advantage, but continuing attacks in the peloton and FDJ-Suez setting Vollering up for the two bonus sprints within a kilometre of each other brought the gap down to 13 seconds.</p>\n<p>Christie won both bonus sprints, Vollering snatched two bonus seconds in the first one while Reusser took the remaining one-second bonification.</p>\n<p>Steffi H√§berlin (SD Worx-Protime) and Julia Borgstr√∂m (AG Insurance-Soudal) then attacked between the two sprints, taking the bonus seconds at the second sprint and bridging to Christie soon after.</p>\n<p>At the Adligenwilerstrasse QOM, H√§berlin, Borgstr√∂m, and Christie were 24 seconds ahead of the chasing peloton where Lidl-Trek and FDJ-Suez did most of the work, reeling in the break with 19km to go, just before the foot of the Michaelskreuzstrasse.</p>\n<p>Climbing 3.9km at an average 9.1%, it was a fierce climb to decide the race, and Reusser took charge right away, setting the pace from the bottom. Halfway up, only Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering, and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) remained with Reusser, but C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), Marion Bunel (Visma-Lease a Bike), Yara Kastelijn (Fenix-Deceuninck), Sarah Gigante, and Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart (both AG Insurance-Soudal) managed to return one kilometre from the top.</p>\n<p>An acceleration by Fisher-Black could not drop any of the other eight riders, but when Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked 500 metres from the QOM point, the group fractured as only Fisher-Black, Reusser, and Vollering could follow.</p>\n<p>These four riders crested the climb together, and Niewiadoma-Phinney and Reusser pushed hard on the descent. Fisher-Black was dropped, but Vollering stayed with them. Niewiadoma-Phinney attacked again with 11km to go, quickly getting a gap as Reusser let Vollering do the chasing.</p>\n<p>Reusser then attacked from behind, and Vollering was unable to reply to her acceleration as the Swiss yellow jersey flew past Niewiadoma-Phinney. At the finish line, Reusser had opened a gap of 28 seconds and could celebrate the stage as well as the overall victory.</p>\n<p>With two stage victories, she also won the black points jersey.

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) stamped his authority on the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, soloing to a second mountain stage win on stage 7 and extending his GC lead over Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease A Bike).</p>\n<p>The Slovenian made his move 12km from the top of the day&#8217;s final climb, Valmeinier 1800, countering a move from Vingegaard&#8217;s teammate Sepp Kuss as he launched clear of the GC group.</p>\n<p>Behind, Vingegaard and Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) gave chase as Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) battled on further back. Vingegaard himself would go solo for the final 10km of the HC-rated climb, but the Dane couldn&#8217;t reel in the yellow jersey, and so he&#8217;d have to settle for another second place.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe wanted to take control on all the climbs, but Visma tried with all the attacks. I was pretty happy with how Pavel and the team rode today. It was sort of defence, to not get attacked by everyone from Visma. So, I launched it and maintained a good pace to the top. I was really happy that I could defend the jersey like this,‚Äù Pogaƒçar said after his stage win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThey attacked towards the top of the Croix de Fer and then actually I think they wanted to drop me on the downhill. They went a little bit dangerous in the first kilometres of the downhill. I didn‚Äôt like that, but it‚Äôs modern cycling.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen Pavel came back and took over the control again and it was all fine. On the last climb, he said he couldn‚Äôt do much longer, so he prepared me for an attack. I just committed because I didn‚Äôt want any attacks from behind.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúToday Jonas was really strong, but I also didn‚Äôt want to go too deep for myself. It was a super-hot and long climb. Luckily, I had enough time to ease up in the last kilometre a little bit and recover.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course, you look at the performances. You know that in the Tour they can be even stronger but also in our team we get two more climbers.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Vingegaard crossed the line 14 seconds after Pogaƒçar, with the gap at the top of the GC now an extended 1:01 ahead of Sunday&#8217;s final stage. Lipowitz finished in third place at 1:21 down, retaining his final podium spot.</p>\n<p>Further back, Evenepoel slipped behind Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility) to finish fifth on the day, 2:39 off Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>The top four spots in the general classification are unchanged heading into Sunday&#8217;s closing stage, with Pogaƒçar now 1:01 up on Vingegaard and 2:21 up on Lipowitz.</p>\n<p>Former race leader Evenepoel falls to a distant 4:11 in the standings in fourth place. Johannessen&#8217;s impressive ride, meanwhile, sees him move up to fifth overall, 5:55 away from yellow.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe penultimate stage of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© brought with it another slew of major mountains; this time, three hors-cat√©gorie ascents packed into just 131.6km of racing.</p>\n<p>The riders would barely have been able to enjoy a metre of flat roads on stage 7, with the climb of the Col de la Madeleine (24.6km at 6.2%) coming right from the very start.</p>\n<p>After a long descent, the Col de la Croix de Fer (22.4km at 6.9%) followed, with a longer descent and a spell in the valley to Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne lying ahead of the final climb to Valmeinier 1800 (16.5km at 6.7%).</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from the very start as riders sought to get away on the uphill start of the Madeleine. Victor Campenaerts (Visma-Lease A Bike) was the first man to make a move, though his efforts came to nothing as he was brought back.</p>\n<p>The Dutch team persisted in launching their men up the road, however, with Sepp Kuss and Matteo Jorgenson among the next batch of riders to make a move. Out front, Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep) were busy creating what would be the break of the day.</p>\n<p>Kuss would make the cut, too, countering after a Jorgenson group was caught. Along with Alexey Lutsenko (Israel-Premier Tech) and Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), he&#8217;d catch the two French leaders.</p>\n<p>The full break ‚Äì 15 riders in all ‚Äì would form by the top of the climb, with Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious), stage 3 winner Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar), Sergio Higuita (XDS-Astana), and Picnic-PostNL pairing Romain Bardet and Juan Martinez among those making the cut.</p>\n<p>The group had made a minute on the much-reduced peloton as they crested the top of the Madeleine, with Higuita grabbing the 15 mountain points there. Their advantage would increase by 15 seconds on the downhill, and all 16 riders began the Croix de Fer together.</p>\n<p>They&#8217;d hold their advantage on the way up, but Paret-Peintre wouldn&#8217;t make it to the top with the breakaway. The Frenchman dropped back to the peloton partway up the mountain, while accelerations from Healy and Bardet near the top put paid to the hopes of several more of their breakaway companions.</p>\n<p>Over the top, just nine remained in the break, with Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ) having bridged across on the way up. However, the peloton ‚Äì now a select group of GC riders led by Jorgenson ‚Äì had almost shut down the gap, with 20 seconds separating the two groups at the start of the descent.</p>\n<p>Bardet, keen to leave a mark on his final race as a professional, made a move to go clear at the front early on the way down. Behind him, the remainder of the break was absorbed by the GC men, though the Colombian trio of Buitrago, Higuita, and Martinez continued to chase in between the groups.</p>\n<p>They were swept up well before the race reached the valley, however, but Bardet continued on alone. With the GC group of around 25 riders unbothered by his presence, he&#8217;d only gain time by the bottom of the descent, hitting the 40km mark with a 50-second lead.</p>\n<p>A lengthy spell on the rising false flat of the valley, and that 16.5km final ascent still lay ahead, though. Pavel Sivakov led the way on behalf of race leader Pogaƒçar, while Vingegaard had strength in numbers with Jorgenson, Kuss, and Ben Tulett surrounding him.</p>\n<p>Bardet persisted at the front, leading the way over the day&#8217;s intermediate sprint at the base of the climb, before starting the ascent with a 35-second lead. Behind him, Decathlon AG2R led the GC group, chipping away at his lead until his solo ride was brought to an end 13km from the top.</p>\n<p>When the catch was made, Visma immediately countered, sending Kuss up the road before Sivakov took up the pacemaking in the group, Pogaƒçar in his wheel. Kuss&#8217;s move would only last a kilometre before the UAE duo dragged him back, though.</p>\n<p>Once the American was in the clutches of the group, Pogaƒçar sensed his chance, accelerating at the front and leaving the rest behind in a bid for his second stage win in as many days.</p>\n<p>The group behind exploded, with Vingegaard and Lipowitz setting in as the second group on the road 10 seconds down, while Evenepoel and Johannessen lay 30 seconds back.</p>\n<p>As the final 10km beckoned, Vingegaard went solo in the chase, dropping Lipowitz. The Dane couldn&#8217;t make up time on his grand rival, however, instead shedding seconds to Pogaƒçar as they raced towards the summit.</p>\n<p>At 7km to go, he lay 20 seconds down, with Lipowitz at 40 seconds, and Evenepoel just over a minute back. He&#8217;d limit his losses from there, though, despite the riders further down the road losing more and more time to Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>From there, as the riders raced into the final 5km of the climb and the stage, there was no major drama and no big changes at the front. Vingegaard battled to limit the time lost, holding the gap at 20 seconds until a late surge to the line saw him gain time after Pogaƒçar&#8217;s victory celebrations.</p>\n<p>It was win number three of the race for the maillot jaune, his 10th of the season, and he now looks all set to add the overall title to his palmar√®s.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) won stage 3 of the Tour de Suisse Women, beating Mischa Bredewold (SD Worx-Protime) by a few centimetres in a sprint that went down to a photo finish.</p>\n<p>Balsamo launched her sprint 250 metres from the finish and raised her left arm just before the finish line, but Bredewold came from behind on the final metres to make it a very close call.</p>\n<p>The Italian held on to win, though, coming away with her fifth win of the year. Swiss champion Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) rounded out the podium in third.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI am really happy. Today was a big goal for us. I was suffering so much the last two days, to win today was really good,‚Äù said Balsamo after her victory was confirmed by a photo finish</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was really tight, but my teammates worked so hard today that I really wanted to win, and I did a super long sprint.

These new attacks were quickly reeled in, though, and although there were more attacks on the run-in to K√ºssnacht, the stage came down to a sprint from a group of 34 riders.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez) gained one second on Marlen Reusser (Movistar) at the day‚Äôs bonus sprints and goes into the final stage with a three-second deficit on the Swiss rider in the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nCovering 123.1km from the Campus Sursee in Oberkirch to K√ºssnacht, the stage was mostly flat (the Swiss kind of flat) as it went past six different lakes. There were still two classified climbs, though, the B√∂√∂ler Passh√∂chi and the Aegeristrasse.</p>\n<p>Faulkner‚Äôs gap to the peloton increased steadily until she was 1:45 minutes ahead with 47km to go, then the peloton took up the chase, preparing for the two bonus sprints on the Tissot Kilometre with 39 and 38km to go. Faulkner took three bonus seconds in both, but behind her, Vollering picked up three bonus seconds while Reusser got two.</p>\n<p>Faulkner was only 20 seconds ahead now but held a small gap to the QOM point on the Aegeristrasse. Soon afterwards, Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit) attacked and bridged to the lone leader, quickly followed by Femke Gerritse (SD Worx-Protime) and Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>When this move was caught, Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike) launched the next attack that did not get away and was countered by C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly) with Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) and Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek) on her wheel, adding a bit of GC action to the stage.</p>\n<p>De Vries, Blanka Vas (SD Worx-Protime), Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez), Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco), and white jersey Eleonora Ciabocco (Picnic PostNL) jumped across the gap, and eventually the move was reeled in with 31km to go.</p>\n<p>Wyllie attacked again 11km from the finish, together with Hengeveld and Ricarda Bauernfeind (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto), but they never had a big gap, and after more riders bridged from the peloton, their move was brought back with 8km to go.</p>\n<p>Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL) made her move 7km from the line and was followed by Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal), Kraak, and De Vries, but they were reeled before the 5km mark. Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) crashed with 3.7km to go, but as she managed to chase back to the peloton, the Spaniard did not lose any time in GC.</p>\n<p>Reusser was brought onto the penultimate kilometre by her teammates Floortje Mackaij and Mareille Meijering, then Kerbaol took over with R√ºegg on her wheel before Emma Norsgaard (Lidl-Trek) came to the front at the flamme rouge with Balsamo.</p>\n<p>Vas moved up through the technical last kilometre and was first at the 400-metre mark with Balsamo and Bredewold on her wheel, opening up a gap. Balsamo then launched her long sprint, and although Bredewold came alongside on the last 75 metres, it was Balsamo who was first to the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Amber Kraak (FDJ-SUEZ) won stage 2 of the Tour de Suisse Women. She attacked from a long-range breakaway on the last climb of the day, dropping her companions and starting a 25-kilometre solo strike. Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) finished second, 1:55 down, after turning into the deviation on the final kilometre but quickly realising her mistake and returning on course.</p>\n<p>√âlise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) won the sprint for third against Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney at 2:43 back, while FDJ-SUEZ&#8217;s Demi Vollering and Marlen Reusser (Movistar) led home the next group at just over 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>Kraak, Lach, Carina Schrempf (Fenix-Deceuninck), Henrietta Christie (EF Education-Oatly), and Agnieszka Skalniak-S√≥jka (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) had gone clear from the peloton 56km into the 161.7km stage.</p>\n<p>Skalniak-S√≥jka lost contact on the Schallenberg climb, the other four stayed together until the Buecheh√ºbeli. Kraak had been sitting on at the back of the group, protecting the GC position of her team leader Vollering, but as their advantage over the peloton had become smaller, she decided to go for it alone on the final climb.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI suffered really a lot [in the heat]. Last week I was still in the Women‚Äôs Tour [of Britain] with nine degrees and full of rain, so yesterday I had a really tough day. Today I felt a little bit better, but I didn‚Äôt feel like I had the best day when I was in the break.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had to be there to be a relay for later in the race for Demi. But in the end, the gap was so big, and then we decided to go for the win,‚Äù said Kraak.</p>\n<p>The stage win is her second Women‚Äôs WorldTour victory after the final stage of the 2024 UAE Tour Women.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s really special, this is now my fourth year as a pro cyclist, and my second WorldTour win. It‚Äôs amazing that it goes this way, and especially with this team. With such good GC riders behind, you can play a bit more, and sometimes you have to work really hard, but other times you can get something back,‚Äù Kraak finished.</p>\n<p>There were no big changes in GC where Reusser still leads by four seconds to Vollering and 1:21 to Niewiadoma-Phinney.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOn the way from Gstaad to the Campus Sursee in Oberkirch, the riders had to tackle three classified climbs &#8211; the long but not particularly steep Schallenberg, the steep wall of Wintermatt, and finally the 5.7km, 6.1% climb of Buecheh√ºbeli, cresting 19.3km from the finish.</p>\n<p>The five escapees &#8211; Kraak, Lach, Schrempf, Christie and Skalniak-S√≥jka &#8211; quickly built a gap of several minutes, and although Skalniak-S√≥jka was dropped with 89km to go, the other four continued undeterred. At the Schallenberg QOM, they were 5:26 ahead, and at the intermediate sprint in Escholzmatt, this had even increased to 6:34.</p>\n<p>The Wintermatt climb saw the peloton take up the chase for real, though, and at the top, only 4:15 separated the break from the group of about 20 riders that had stayed together on the climb. Wearing the white U23 jersey, Eleonora Ciabocco (Picnic PostNL) then attacked from the peloton on the descent and quickly gained over a minute.</p>\n<p>At the start of the Buecheh√ºbeli climb, the four escapees were 2:50 ahead of Ciabocco and just over four minutes up on what remained of the peloton. Kraak went to the front right away and pushed hard, fracturing the group as each rider climbed at her own pace. At the QOM, Kraak had gained 1:34 on Lach while Schrempf and Christie were 3:10 behind.</p>\n<p>Ciabocco followed at 3:28 with Niewiadoma-Phinney at 3:40. The Polish all-rounder had made two moves on the climb before finally breaking free, cresting the climb 21 seconds ahead of the other GC riders.</p>\n<p>Niewiadoma-Phinney caught up with Ciabocco on the descent, and together they reeled in Schrempf and Christie. On the flat run-in to the finish, a group with Reusser, Vollering, Chabbey, Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek), Garc√≠a, Noemi R√ºegg, and C√©drine Kerbaol (both EF Education-Oatly) came back, forming a group of 11 riders.</p>\n<p>Kerbaol tried to get away but only succeeded in stringing the group out in single file. Garc√≠a launched her move and got a gap, with Niewiadoma-Phinney and Chabbey bridging to the Spaniard. This trio crossed the finish line 30 seconds ahead of the others, taking back some time in GC. Up front, though, Kraak‚Äôs stage victory was never in doubt.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14577&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) produced a stunning ride on stage 6 of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, dropping all of his rivals on the C√¥te de Domancy to both win the stage and wrest back control of the overall race lead in dominant fashion.</p>\n<p>After starting the day with time to make up on Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike), Pogaƒçar restored his position at the top after a rapid lead-out from his team and a subsequent ruthless seated attack.</p>\n<p>Jhonatan Narv√°ez did for everyone except for Vingegaard, proving his worth again as a new signing for 2025, before the world champion blasted away and dropped Vingegaard, riding in the saddle the whole time, with around 7km left to ride.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar quickly caught the last remnant of the early breakaway, Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost), then kicked on up the final C√¥te de la Cry climb to win solo at the finish, with big time gaps to those behind.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard was the second best on the road, but could only limit his losses to 1:01, with Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) continuing to impress in third, as Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Evenepoel crossed the line 1:30 and 1:50 down respectively.</p>\n<p>With the damage done, Pogaƒçar swapped out his rainbow jersey for a yellow one, with a 43-second advantage to Vingegaard in second, and a 54-second lead over surprise package Lipowitz in third, with the queen stage to come tomorrow, before a final mountain test on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel&#8217;s losses saw him drop to fourth overall at 1:22, after a valiant fight in the yellow jersey, with Jorgenson set to start stage 7 in fifth, at a 1:41 deficit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Tim [Wellens] was super strong, Pavel [Sivakov], Jhonny [Narv√°ez] too, they were really incredible today, all the team actually. In the end, I felt good, and we said we would go from the bottom of the climb on the steepest part,&#8221; said Pogaƒçar post-stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We committed, because we have nothing to lose, only to gain, and it was like this. It was a hot day, a hard day, and I had to hurry up just to see the finish of Ur≈°ka [≈Ωigart, his partner and women&#8217;s WorldTour pro] at the Tour de Suisse, and I made it just in time, so all good.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I was feeling really good and when I attacked, it was an all-out effort and I knew it was still around 15 minutes after the C√¥te de Domancy to the top, so I had to pace myself and the feeling was there, the legs were turning, and it was just in my favour to be in front and gain time. One minute is good, and I&#8217;m super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 6 of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© saw the riders set out to more hot and sunny conditions in Valserh√¥ne, with 126km and the first summit finish of the race awaiting them in Combloux.</p>\n<p>A rapid first hour of racing was opened up by green jersey Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), but the eight-man breakaway of the day didn&#8217;t form until 20 more kilometres of full-gas attacking and counter-attacking were completed.</p>\n<p>Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers) sparked a new move just inside 100km to go, with four riders initially following him: Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility), Pierre Thierry (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and Anthony Turgis (TotalEnergies).</p>\n<p>Van der Poel then ensured he didn&#8217;t miss out with another burst, but this time, he had both Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) and Romain Bardet (Picnic PostNL) for company, as they made it eight in the lead of stage 6 on the steep first categorised climb of the day up the C√¥te de Villy-le-Pelloux.</p>\n<p>With the break gone, the peloton settled into a holding pattern with Pogaƒçar&#8217;s UAE team keeping control in front of Evenepoel&#8217;s Soudal-QuickStep train. Unfortunately, for those in front anyway, this meant the gap was kept close, around 1:30, with Domen Novak working away for a likely Pogaƒçar assault in the final.</p>\n<p>As the second categorised climb up C√¥te de Mont-Saxonnex (5.5km at 8.6%), there was a change in the peloton, with Visma-Lease a Bike coming to the front with number, making sure Vingegaard was in an ideal position.</p>\n<p>The injection of pace behind saw Evenepoel left out of position and caught behind a split at the foot. It didn&#8217;t take him long to get back to the front, however, and he was soon on Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel as the men in yellow and black powered on in numbers.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel and Bardet dropped out of the break, with their advantage being halved to just 40 seconds with 43km to go. Armirail, Baudin and Leonard proved the strongest, but they would soon be caught, too.</p>\n<p>The first Visma move came from Sepp Kuss, with all the big names shutting it down instantly, but it was then Lipowitz who kicked on, prompting Jorgenson into chasing for Visma, with Pogaƒçar, Evenepoel and Vingegaard following in the wheel.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz was allowed some advantage, as Pogaƒçar waited for teammates to return and bring the German back gradually. While at the same time, the gap to now just Baudin and Leonard had stabilised to 45 seconds.</p>\n<p>Aside from the superstars and their teammates, just Enric Mas (Movistar), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla) and 18-year-old super talent Paul Seixas (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) could follow in the GC favourites group.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz was reeled back in by Wellens with 40km to go and just a few hundred metres of the climb to go, allowing Leonard and Baudin&#8217;s gap to extend back out to a minute.</p>\n<p>The GC group that formed on the road towards the final climb was made up of Vingegaard, Jorgenson, Ben Tullett (Visma-Lease a Bike), Pogaƒçar, Wellens, Evenepoel, Lipowitz, Mas, Seixas, Armirail, Dunbar, Leknessund and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>They were soon joined by a large chase group, led by Bahrain-Victorious for Santiago Buitrago and Lenny Martinez, with more teammates arriving to help both Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar. This let the leading duo build out their lead to 1:22, giving them a chance, yes, but only a very narrow one.</p>\n<p>With a duo of climbs set to decide the day, the breakaway remnants reached the foot of the C√¥te de Domancy (2.5km at 9.3%), with a lead of 1:14 en route to the finish up the C√¥te de la Cry (2.7km at 7.7%). On home roads, Baudin quickly left Leonard behind with 8km to go, in a hit out for glory on stage 6.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the previous climb, Pogaƒçar was led into the Domancy by three of his teammates, with Visma sitting close behind for Vingegaard. Jhonatan Narv√°ez took over for the world champion and set an infernal pace, dropping everyone, including Evenepoel, Jorgenson and Lipowitz, except for Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar took over on his own just 30 seconds behind the leader on the road, and while Vingegaard initially stuck to his wheel, quickly, balance was restored for Pogaƒçar, who powered away in the saddle with ease.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel lost 35 seconds in quick time, but paced at his own tempo behind to try and limit the damage. Vingegaard in no way blew up, but climbed 17 seconds behind Pogaƒçar, who caught Baudin with 6.7km to go and went solo in search of the stage win.</p>\n<p>However, the world champion continued to accelerate as those behind faltered.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz attacked a chasing group behind, having lost a minute to Pogaƒçar, which none of Evenepoel, Jorgenson or Wellens could follow. The American waited for his moment, but a few kilometres later, he also attacked away from the yellow jersey to try and minimise his loss.</p>\n<p>As the line arrived, Pogaƒçar looked as easy as ever to take victory solo, with the demolition behind following him in. Vingegaard was next finish having lost a minute, offering his congratulations to the new race leader at the finish. Behind, Evenepoel and the rest of the GC riders came home in ones and twos, having felt the full force of a top-level Tadej Pogaƒçar on stage 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Armirail, Baudin and Leonard proved the strongest, but they would soon be caught, too.</p>\n<p>The first Visma move came from Sepp Kuss, with all the big names shutting it down instantly, but it was then Lipowitz who kicked on, prompting Jorgenson into chasing for Visma, with Pogaƒçar, Evenepoel and Vingegaard following in the wheel.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz was allowed some advantage, as Pogaƒçar waited for teammates to return and bring the German back gradually. While at the same time, the gap to now just Baudin and Leonard had stabilised to 45 seconds.</p>\n<p>Aside from the superstars and their teammates, just Enric Mas (Movistar), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla) and 18-year-old super talent Paul Seixas (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) could follow in the GC favourites group.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz was reeled back in by Wellens with 40km to go and just a few hundred metres of the climb to go, allowing Leonard and Baudin&#8217;s gap to extend back out to a minute.</p>\n<p>The GC group that formed on the road towards the final climb was made up of Vingegaard, Jorgenson, Ben Tullett (Visma-Lease a Bike), Pogaƒçar, Wellens, Evenepoel, Lipowitz, Mas, Seixas, Armirail, Dunbar, Leknessund and Tobias Halland Johannessen (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>They were soon joined by a large chase group, led by Bahrain-Victorious for Santiago Buitrago and Lenny Martinez, with more teammates arriving to help both Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar. This let the leading duo build out their lead to 1:22, giving them a chance, yes, but only a very narrow one.</p>\n<p>With a duo of climbs set to decide the day, the breakaway remnants reached the foot of the C√¥te de Domancy (2.5km at 9.3%), with a lead of 1:14 en route to the finish up the C√¥te de la Cry (2.7km at 7.7%). On home roads, Baudin quickly left Leonard behind with 8km to go, in a hit out for glory on stage 6.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the previous climb, Pogaƒçar was led into the Domancy by three of his teammates, with Visma sitting close behind for Vingegaard. Jhonatan Narv√°ez took over for the world champion and set an infernal pace, dropping everyone, including Evenepoel, Jorgenson and Lipowitz, except for Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar took over on his own just 30 seconds behind the leader on the road, and while Vingegaard initially stuck to his wheel, quickly, balance was restored for Pogaƒçar, who powered away in the saddle with ease.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel lost 35 seconds in quick time, but paced at his own tempo behind to try and limit the damage. Vingegaard in no way blew up, but climbed 17 seconds behind Pogaƒçar, who caught Baudin with 6.7km to go and went solo in search of the stage win.</p>\n<p>However, the world champion continued to accelerate as those behind faltered.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz attacked a chasing group behind, having lost a minute to Pogaƒçar, which none of Evenepoel, Jorgenson or Wellens could follow. The American waited for his moment, but a few kilometres later, he also attacked away from the yellow jersey to try and minimise his loss.</p>\n<p>As the line arrived, Pogaƒçar looked as easy as ever to take victory solo, with the demolition behind following him in. Vingegaard was next finish having lost a minute, offering his congratulations to the new race leader at the finish. Behind, Evenepoel and the rest of the GC riders came home in ones and twos, having felt the full force of a top-level Tadej Pogaƒçar on stage 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech) has taken a surprise bunch sprint victory on stage 5 of the 2025 Criterium du Dauphine in a chaotic dash for the line at M√¢con, while race leader Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) was caught up in a late crash but could complete the stage.</p>\n<p>In the last 300 metres Lidl-Trek were leading the string close to the barriers for leading favourite and stage 2 winner Jonathan Milan, but when Stewart powered past on their right, Milan began to fade notably.</p>\n<p>Axel Laurence (Ineos Grenadiers) claimed second place behind the British sprinter, with S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) in third.

This in turn allowed two further riders, Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Thibaut Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;BHotels) to bridge across, with just over 100 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>The five stage leaders came through the first of a chain of four minor midstage climbs, the category 4 C√¥te de Saint-Amour, with their scant advantage still hovering at two minutes. Meanwhile, there was bad news for XDS-Astana as Harold Tejada, seventh overall, abandoned and then German sprinter Ackermann also had to quit because of a crash. Leader Evenepoel was not immune to misfortune, either, losing long standing team captain Louis Vervaeke to a fall. Vervaeke suffered a broken collarbone, which throws his Tour de France participation seriously in question as well.</p>\n<p>With 50 kilometres left, the five leaders&#8217; advantage on three counter-attackers &#8211; former World TT Champion Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers), Gregor Muhlberger (Movistar) and Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) &#8211; was still at 1:09, while the main group were at 1:37. Lidl-Trek&#8217;s fierce pace as the stage wound past vineyards and threaded its way through narrow village streets proved more than sufficient to reel in the trio of chasers shortly afterwards.</p>\n<p>The five leaders were another story, staying away stubbornly as the race ground over the grinding last categorized challenge of the day, the category 3 C√¥te des Quatre Vents.</p>\n<p>Finally, Thierry was the first to crack in the break halfway up the Quatre Vents, while Leijnse just managed to regain contact. One Picnic-PostNL rider angrily waved the TV camera bikes away from ahead of the peloton as they tried to chase down his breakaway teammate Leijnse on the fast descent and the flatter run that followed into M√¢con.

It is the ninth edition of the Tour de Suisse Women and the twentieth event of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour calendar. This year, the race is being held before the men&#8217;s Tour de Suisse.</p>\n<p>Marlen Reusser (Movistar) won stage 1 of the Tour de Suisse Women, beating Demi Vollering (FDJ-SUEZ) in a sprint √† deux in Gstaad. Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) finished third from a chase group of three, 1:41 minutes behind.</p>\n<p>Reusser attacked after the top of the first-category Jaunpass, flying down the descent, and Vollering bridged to her with considerable effort. From there, they effectively rode a pair TT together for 57km, sharing the time bonifications at the two bonus sprints and building an advantage of over two minutes on the chase group of Niewiadoma-Phinney, Niamh Fisher-Black, and Ur≈°ka ≈Ωigart, with the next group even further back.</p>\n<p>Reusser attacked 2.2km from the finish line but could not shake Vollering who then stayed on Reusser&#8217;s wheel all the way to the finishing straight which meant that their advantage shrank again.</p>\n<p>Vollering started her sprint with 250 metres to go, and it looked like she had beaten Reusser, but the Swiss woman came back and passed Vollering on the last 100 metres to win the stage and take the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt all went perfect, perfect, perfect, and I‚Äôm super happy. I think she [Vollering] went a bit early [in the sprint], it was perfect,‚Äù Reusser was happy about her stage win in the post-race interview.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was really our plan to make it a very, very small group, or if I‚Äôm alone, even, we didn‚Äôt care either. After that climbing, when the climb is hard, it‚Äôs going to be small groups that all have to push. There will be people looking at each other, there will not be so much cohesion, so you know that with not too big of an effort, you can go pretty far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought even if a group would come back, everybody needed to work, so it‚Äôs not so risky,‚Äù Reusser explained her long-range attack.</p>\n<p>She now leads the GC with four seconds on Vollering and 1:51 minutes to Niewiadoma.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs the goal [to defend the yellow jersey], although I have to say, it‚Äôs not going to be easy, and the result, we will see in the end. But we will try, of course,‚Äù finished Reusser.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing in Gstaad, the stage covered 95.5km on a large anti-clockwise loop through the Berner Oberland and parts of the cantons of Fribourg and Vaud. The two climbs of the Sannenm√∂ser and Jaunpass came in the first third of the stage, with the rest of the stage mainly flat (for Switzerland, that is).</p>\n<p>The peloton stayed together over the Sannenm√∂ser climb where Morgane Coston (Roland) took the QOM points, but the lower slopes of the Jaunpass reduced the peloton to about 30 riders as Movistar set a hard pace.</p>\n<p>Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked 4km from the top, but when Sarah Gigante (AG Insurance-Soudal) went after her and closed the gap, she brought the rest of the peloton with her.</p>\n<p>Gigante attacked again 3.1km from the top, and when Reusser, Niewiadoma-Phinney, Vollering ≈Ωigart, C√©drine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), Fisher-Black, and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) reeled her in with 2.2km to the QOM sprint, the selection was made.</p>\n<p>Garc√≠a and Kerbaol couldn‚Äôt follow the pace that was set by Reusser and Gigante, and the Australian led the group of six over the QOM summit, taking maximum points and moving into the red mountain jersey.</p>\n<p>After a breather at the back of the group, Reusser attacked into the descent, quickly opening a gap. Only Vollering was able to come back halfway down the mountain, and the two former teammates settled into a steady rhythm, trading turns equally on the way back to Gstaad.</p>\n<p>They rolled through the Tissot kilometre, two bonus sprints within 1,000 metres of each other at 16km and 15km to go, with Vollering taking the first one and Reusser the second, both gaining five bonus seconds each.

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Time trial world champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) blasted to victory and the overall race lead on stage 4 of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, completing the 17.4km individual time trial in 20:50 to take his second win in the discipline this year.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel takes over the yellow jersey from stage 3 winner Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar), and made gains on his two main GC rivals Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>Vingegaard finished second on the stage, 20 seconds down on Evenepoel, whilst Pogaƒçar took fourth, ceding 48 seconds to the Belgian at the halfway point of the race.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel came across the line 37 seconds faster than previous leader Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike), who was knocked off the hotseat but held on for third on the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was actually a tough one, it made me think of stage 7 of the Tour last year, a flat run-in and then the climb,&#8221; Evenepoel said at the finish, referencing another TT he won last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This one was a bit steeper, a bit harder, but my goal was to go as fast as possible until the intermediate, and then after that just try to get a steady pace to the finish line. I think the advantage I had was that there was a lot of headwind in the valleys before and after the climb so I used that to really take the benefit of my position and of the power that I can do, and then in the climb I just went as fast as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is some contention over whether the figure is actually correct, given some wins struck from the record, but Soudal-QuickStep are celebrating Evenepoel&#8217;s win as their 1000th victory, with special t-shirts and caps made for the occasion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy with this victory, number 1000, as the cap says, of the team. So I&#8217;m very proud to have done it,&#8221; Evenepoel said. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s one for Patrick [Lefevere, team founder] and the whole past and everything that he did for the team. This victory is for him and all of his career.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The mid-week time trial brought significant changes in the GC, with gaps beginning to emerge between the &#8216;Big Three&#8217;, with some others climbing the rankings too.</p>\n<p>After gaining time on stage 3 and finishing fifth in the TT, Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) is up to second overall, just four seconds behind Evenepoel, whilst Iv√°n Romeo&#8217;s effort sees him still in third, nine seconds down.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard is up to fifth, 16 seconds adrift of the leader, whilst Pogaƒçar in in eighth, 38 seconds down on Evenepoel. Matteo Jorgenson also jumped 19 places to ninth, just a second behind Pogaƒçar.</p>\n<p>Green jersey Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) is still fourth overall, 14 seconds down, with the chance of yellow not an impossibility with a punchy stage still to come on Thursday.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWednesday&#8217;s time trial offered a 17.4km test from Charmes-sur Rh√¥ne to Saint-P√©ray, with a 1,800-metre rise in the middle that added around 200 metres of elevation into the otherwise straightforward parcours.</p>\n<p>Setting off in reverse-GC order, the first riders didn&#8217;t set particularly meaningful markers, and it wasn&#8217;t until Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) finished that the real first benchmark time was set. He stopped the clock at 22:00, and remained in the lead for the first part of the day.</p>\n<p>It was R√©mi Cavagna (Groupama-FDJ) who eventually set the next best time, clocking in at 21:57. A few GC riders and climbers started to finish soon after Cavagna, but none troubled the French specialist&#8217;s time, with Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) both finishing 51 seconds down on Cavagna.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson, however, smashed the Frenchman&#8217;s time, going fastest by 28 seconds after a full-out effort to put himself into the hotseat. But with Evenepoel setting off soon after Jorgenson, as well as Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard, it seemed a given that the American&#8217;s impressive time would likely still fall.</p>\n<p>Predictably, Evenepoel took a whopping 37 seconds out of Jorgenson&#8217;s time, stopping the clock at 20:50, a time that, eventually, no one would beat. Vingegaard stopped the clock at 21:11, beating his teammate Jorgenson but still 21 seconds adrift of Evenepoel.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar was the slowest of the three big GC contenders, perhaps surprisingly, ceding 49 seconds to Evenepoel to finish fourth on the stage and move into eighth overall.</p>\n<p>Stage 3&#8217;s GC time winner Florian Lipowitz also put in a strong ride, finishing fifth on the stage which, combined with his exploits on Tuesday, sees him sit second overall, only four seconds back on Evenepoel and a clear GC contender after his runner-up finish at Paris-Nice.</p>\n<p>There are still four stages to go in France, but many GC riders are now over a minute down on Evenepoel, and it looks like the overall may be largely contested between the riders currently in the top 10, which includes the &#8216;Big Three&#8217;, Lipowitz, Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla) and Harold Tejada (XDS Astana).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I don&#8217;t know what to say, honestly, I think it was one of the toughest days of my life so far,&#8221; said Romeo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The breakaway, it was so hard to get into it, and I was not feeling really good. I had to tell the car I needed to take the risk and not be very active, so I waited to the last moment, and I know in this kind of flat final in a small break, I have good instinct and that if they give me some seconds, I can make it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The moment they didn&#8217;t chase me for like one minute, I thought &#8216;yes, I have to go flat out to the line&#8217;,&#8221; he added, with his winning move being the second attack he made in the final 10km.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew the final, I had this stage on my mind for one month, we have been doing altitude at Sierra Nevada, working super hard with all the team and they gave me this chance at the beginning of the week, so to be able to pull it off like this, I think I don&#8217;t know what I just did.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hard work always pays off, and today it was the case.&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe start of stage 3 at the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© was all about one man ‚Äì Romain Bardet (Picnic PostNL), with the race heading out from his hometown of Brioude, and large crowds of fans coming to see their local hero in his last race before retirement.</p>\n<p>However, once the heartwarming tributes were completed, it was time to race for the 153-rider strong peloton, and it was full gas right out of neutral for the 207.2km road east to Charantonnay.</p>\n<p>Several attacks were launched on C√¥te de Cornille (4.1 km at 4.8%) and C√¥te de la Barbate (5.8km at 6.8%), as the stage climbed immediately after the flag drop, with green jersey Van der Poel and Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) among the highest profile early movers.</p>\n<p>Bardet himself was involved in the furious fight for the break, but it was Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) who got the jump and momentarily found separation. By this point, yellow jersey Milan was already 2:40 in arrears.</p>\n<p>The big guns weren&#8217;t staying out of it either, with Evenepoel trying something in the opening hour, but as the intermediate sprint in La Chaise-Dieu approached, he was beaten to the line by Pogaƒçar and Barr√©, with the GC pair gaining 2 and 1 seconds respectively on Vingegaard.</p>\n<p>Respite arrived after the rapid opening 35km of climbing, with the next portion of descending roads allowing a group of 13 to form in front: Axel Laurance, Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers), Ivan Romeo (Movistar), Brieuc Rolland (Groupama-FDJ), Harold Tejada (XDS Astana), Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek), Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility), Krists Neilands (Israel-Premier Tech), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco AlUla), Anthony Turgis (TotalEnergies), Barr√© and Van der Poel.</p>\n<p>With UAE settling in to control the gap, which was out to one minute with 160km to go, Milan also had the chance to try and get rejoin the peloton, after dropping away during the brutal, attacking start.</p>\n<p>Milan made it back in by the foot of the next climb, C√¥te de Malataverne (5.4 km at 3.8%), but with the real GC threat of Lipowitz, Romeo and Dunbar being in the break, it saw UAE and Soudal cut the break&#8217;s advantage down from 2:40 to 1:30 on the climb, causing the yellow jersey to again get left behind.</p>\n<p>The Italian soon returned as the status quo resumed after the climb, with a long descent allowing him to get back in. UAE, Soudal and Visma did begin to chase, keeping the gap as close as 1:45 with 50km to go, but the approach to the C√¥te du Ch√¢teau saw the GC teams relent.</p>\n<p>With the next climb&#8217;s average gradients at 9.5%, and being a narrow road, the nerves in the peloton couldn&#8217;t have been higher, causing the GC teams to naturally bring the gap down to the break, as they looked to maintain front position for their leader.</p>\n<p>Those in the break hit the foot of the climb with 20km to ride and with a minute advantage, but behind, the pace was absolutely furious. Quickly, Leonard and Turgis were dropped as Bernard pressed on with an attack.</p>\n<p>Soon, however, the French rider was joined on the climb by a flying Lipowitz, Tejada and Leknessund, with the former trying to maximise his GC gain, with the likes of Van der Poel pacing in the first chase group up the steep gradients.</p>\n<p>A sharp tempo in front saw Milan drop early on the climb once again, losing a minute in quick time, but the GC favourites all sat comfortably together after Vingegaard recovered from a poor entry position and moved up to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel bridged across to the four leaders with some stellar descending, joined by Barr√©, making it now six in the lead with a 1:17 advantage over the UAE-led peloton, with 12km left to race. The Classics superstar&#8217;s presence saw the cooperation fail in front, though, and 10 of the original 13-man breakaway came back together.</p>\n<p>What followed was a messy series of attacks from the breakaway, with the peloton too far behind to make the catch, as Van der Poel, Lipowitz, Tejada and Bernard all tried to break away in front and hit out for stage glory.</p>\n<p>Instead, it was Romeo who found joy with a solo move, trying twice, with the second attempt sticking. Hesitation allowed his gap to grow, and attempts by Van der Poel and Lipowitz to bring him back were futile without full cooperation.</p>\n<p>The Spanish rider time trialled alone and survived all the way to the line, 14 seconds ahead of a three-man chase group, and 27 seconds in front of the Van der Poel-led group, who sprinted it out for fifth place.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and the rest of the GC favourites rolled across the line after a brutal day on the bike in the heat and with an average speed of 45kph, 1:08 down.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

UAE, Soudal and Visma did begin to chase, keeping the gap as close as 1:45 with 50km to go, but the approach to the C√¥te du Ch√¢teau saw the GC teams relent.</p>\n<p>With the next climb&#8217;s average gradients at 9.5%, and being a narrow road, the nerves in the peloton couldn&#8217;t have been higher, causing the GC teams to naturally bring the gap down to the break, as they looked to maintain front position for their leader.</p>\n<p>Those in the break hit the foot of the climb with 20km to ride and with a minute advantage, but behind, the pace was absolutely furious. Quickly, Leonard and Turgis were dropped as Bernard pressed on with an attack.</p>\n<p>Soon, however, the French rider was joined on the climb by a flying Lipowitz, Tejada and Leknessund, with the former trying to maximise his GC gain, with the likes of Van der Poel pacing in the first chase group up the steep gradients.</p>\n<p>A sharp tempo in front saw Milan drop early on the climb once again, losing a minute in quick time, but the GC favourites all sat comfortably together after Vingegaard recovered from a poor entry position and moved up to Pogaƒçar&#8217;s wheel.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel bridged across to the four leaders with some stellar descending, joined by Barr√©, making it now six in the lead with a 1:17 advantage over the UAE-led peloton, with 12km left to race. The Classics superstar&#8217;s presence saw the cooperation fail in front, though, and 10 of the original 13-man breakaway came back together.</p>\n<p>What followed was a messy series of attacks from the breakaway, with the peloton too far behind to make the catch, as Van der Poel, Lipowitz, Tejada and Bernard all tried to break away in front and hit out for stage glory.</p>\n<p>Instead, it was Romeo who found joy with a solo move, trying twice, with the second attempt sticking. Hesitation allowed his gap to grow, and attempts by Van der Poel and Lipowitz to bring him back were futile without full cooperation.</p>\n<p>The Spanish rider time trialled alone and survived all the way to the line, 14 seconds ahead of a three-man chase group, and 27 seconds in front of the Van der Poel-led group, who sprinted it out for fifth place.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar and the rest of the GC favourites rolled across the line after a brutal day on the bike in the heat and with an average speed of 45kph, 1:08 down.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Who else but Tadej Pogaƒçar? On a day destined for the fast men, the world champion won an incredible opening stage of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, out-sprinting Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) out of a star-studded breakaway into Montlu√ßon.</p>\n<p>The five-man move, which also contained Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious), was sparked by Vingegaard inside a chaotic final 6km filled with attacks after the last categorised climb.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel worked the hardest in the move after bridging across late with a sense it could stay away, but he lacked the punch in the final sprint to come around Van der Poel, who opened things up and finished third behind the two GC stars.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar burst late out of the slipstream, with Vingegaard nearly pipping him to the line. The pair of champions shared a nice moment past the line, before the world champion high-fived two fans, making their day after clearly enjoying the late attack.</p>\n<p>The bunch sprint was led in by Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech), but they were unable to deny the best rider in the world from taking yet another leader&#8217;s yellow jersey, finishing on the same time as him just metres behind. The Tour de France is still weeks away, but the stars are already coming to the fore.</p>\n<p>Was he expecting this? &#8220;No, I was not, I was all prepared to come back pretty fast to the bus after the finish, to take a shower, take a comfortable seat and enjoy the rest of the day, but I don&#8217;t mind being here as well,&#8221; said Pogaƒçar in his winner&#8217;s interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I followed the moves on the steep part of the climb, and then Visma was clearly going for the stage win; they were trying with everyone to attack on the top. Fortunately, I had good legs and I covered all the attacks. Then, even Jonas, for the cherry on top, he attacked and that one was painful; luckily, it was downhill all the way to the finish, so I could recover a bit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[With] 2km to go I was thinking more about the sprint than just the GC.

They were allowed to build a three-minute advantage but were kept relatively close by Lidl-Trek and Israel-Premier Tech, who were pacing for their respective sprinters.</p>\n<p>Thierry outlasted Ourselin, after making it to the first KOM sprints, leaving the former on his own with 54km to go, but the peloton was beginning to close in quickly.</p>\n<p>The action kicked off as the race reached the penultimate ascent of the C√¥te de Buffon (0.6km at 8.8%), where EF Education-EasyPost decided to test everyone&#8217;s legs with a move from long-range specialist Ben Healy and his compatriot Archie Ryan.</p>\n<p>They weren&#8217;t allowed any room to breathe, though, as suddenly the rainbow stripes of Pogaƒçar responded, perhaps showing his intentions, which of course, prompted Vingegaard to be attentive and snap onto his wheel.</p>\n<p>Things calmed, but it was a preview of the climb, which would arrive as the final characterised test of the stage, 8km from the finish in Montlu√ßon.</p>\n<p>Fred Wright (Bahrain-Victorious) countered over the top of the calming down, with Thierry&#8217;s day in front ending soon after the Brit bridged across to him. However, the Bahrain rider was soon back in with 7km to go, as the peloton ramped up in pace at the foot of the final climb.</p>\n<p>Axel Laurence (Ineos Grenadiers) opened up the racing on the 600-metre steep ascent, but there was little separation with all of the favourites for GC following close behind. Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) made a small move once it flattened out, but this prompted Van der Poel to respond, with Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard again on his wheel, cancelling it out.</p>\n<p>The big move, however, came from Vingegaard himself with a counter 5.5km from the finish. Pogaƒçar and Van der Poel went with him, as did Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious). Noticing the danger, Evenepoel then blasted across solo on the flat.</p>\n<p>All of the sprint teams behind struggled to find the numbers required to chase, with several small attacks only hurting the peloton&#8217;s chances. By the time the race reached the flamme rouge, those in front had worked well enough that it looked as though they would make it.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel in top condition would have cleaned up the GC stars in a sprint, but with his recent wrist fracture, he showed signs of weakness in the final sprint. He opened things up, but all of Evenepoel, Pogaƒçar and Vingegaard were closing.</p>\n<p>The former world champion faded, with the current rainbow jersey coming around him, Vingegaard too, with Pogaƒçar claiming a famous victory to open up this year&#8217;s Dauphin√©, after a finish dominated by four of cycling&#8217;s absolute best riders.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s stage from Pr√©milhat to Issoire features a similarly undulating parcours and could be one for the sprinters, but after today&#8217;s dramatic events, who knows whether Pogaƒçar and the rest of the superstars will decide whether it&#8217;s a day for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. </p>\n<p>Who else but Tadej Pogaƒçar? On a day destined for the fast men, the world champion won an incredible opening stage of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√©, out-sprinting Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) out of a star-studded breakaway into Montlu√ßon.</p>\n<p>The five-man move, which also contained Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain-Victorious), was sparked by Vingegaard inside a chaotic final 6km filled with attacks after the last categorised climb.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel worked the hardest in the move after bridging across late with a sense it could stay away, but he lacked the punch in the final sprint to come around Van der Poel, who opened things up and finished third behind the two GC stars.</p>\n<p>Pogaƒçar burst late out of the slipstream, with Vingegaard nearly pipping him to the line. The pair of champions shared a nice moment past the line, before the world champion high-fived two fans, making their day after clearly enjoying the late attack.</p>\n<p>The bunch sprint was led in by Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech), but they were unable to deny the best rider in the world from taking yet another leader&#8217;s yellow jersey, finishing on the same time as him just metres behind. The Tour de France is still weeks away, but the stars are already coming to the fore.</p>\n<p>Was he expecting this? &#8220;No, I was not, I was all prepared to come back pretty fast to the bus after the finish, to take a shower, take a comfortable seat and enjoy the rest of the day, but I don&#8217;t mind being here as well,&#8221; said Pogaƒçar in his winner&#8217;s interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I followed the moves on the steep part of the climb, and then Visma was clearly going for the stage win; they were trying with everyone to attack on the top. Fortunately, I had good legs and I covered all the attacks. Then, even Jonas, for the cherry on top, he attacked and that one was painful; luckily, it was downhill all the way to the finish, so I could recover a bit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[With] 2km to go I was thinking more about the sprint than just the GC. I knew Van der Poel was the fastest obviously in the group, but after a finish like this, you cannot count the rest out, they can be fast as well. I switched my focus, and it worked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can go home from Dauphin√© happy already, but I want to see how the shape will be in the TT and on the mountain stages.

So it came down to the last sprint, and there was a moment of doubt halfway through that last lap where I thought ‚ÄòI just cannot do this today‚Äô, and my teammates really helped me pull it together and pulled me to the front for the final.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage was held on an 8.4km city-centre circuit in Glasgow. With the start of the first lap neutralised, ten laps came out to a total of 82.2km of racing, with intermediate sprints offering time bonuses after the fourth, sixth, and eighth lap.</p>\n<p>Kool suffered a mechanical on lap 2 but quickly returned to the peloton. On lap 3, Anna Morris (Great Britain) launched a solo attack that lasted for a few kilometres before she was caught again.</p>\n<p>At the end of lap 4, Ferguson was first through the last corner with 170 metres to go and looked like the winner of the first intermediate sprint, but Wollaston squeezed past on the final metres to take three bonus seconds ahead of two for Ferguson, making up one second of her three-second deficit.</p>\n<p>Wollaston beat Ferguson to the line in the second intermediate sprint, too, and now sat only one second behind the green jersey. Ferguson continued the ‚Äòcurse of the leader‚Äôs jersey‚Äô ‚Äì after bad luck for Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) on stages 2 and 3, Ferguson had a mechanical halfway through lap 5.</p>\n<p>The 19-year-old Yorkshirewoman never panicked, did an excellent bike change and soon rejoined the back of the peloton. Her teammates brought her back to the front, and Ferguson was second in the last intermediate sprint, again behind Wollaston who now had the same time as the green jersey, setting up an exciting sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Morris attacked again on lap 9 and was ten seconds ahead as the bell rang for the final lap, but she was reeled in with just over 5km to go. On the turn into Glasgow Green, Marta Lach (SD Worx-Protime) took the front with Wiebes in her wheel, and the European champion launched her sprint at the 300-metre mark, going first through the final corner before accelerating again to win by several bike lengths to Kool.</p>\n<p>Behind Wiebes and Kool, Wollaston was piloted into third position by her teammate C√©lia Gery and kept this to the line, taking the last bonus seconds to win the overall classification. FDJ-Suez also won the team classification while Ferguson took the white U23 jersey and the red points jersey. Dominika W≈Çodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) won the blue QOM jersey, and Grace Lister (Hess) was the best-placed local Continental rider in 15th place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is decided in 2023 that the event will be transformed into a complete tour.</p>\n<p>Demi Vollering conquered the monstrous 19.1km Coll de Pal climb solo to win stage 2 of the Volta a Catalunya Femenina, after another perfect day for FDJ-Suez moved her into the race leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>The Dutch star attacked with 10.7km remaining on the brutal climb near La Molina, with only Visma-Lease a Bike&#8217;s Marion Bunel able to follow her initially. </p>\n<p>The pair extended their lead on all of the chasers out to more than 1:30 as the slopes continued, but Bunel always looked to be struggling more as Vollering powered on, eventually dropping her to go solo in the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Vollering took over the race lead from her teammate Elise Chabbey, who did a stellar job leading out the Dutch rider before her eventual attack, with stage runner-up Bunel moving into third overall thanks to her strong performance, crossing the line 31 seconds after Vollering.</p>\n<p>Chabbey lost the sprint for third place and the remaining bonus seconds to Femke de Vries (Visma-Lease a Bike), but kept her place on the overall podium after finishing two minutes down on her team leader. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a pretty hard day, a lot of climbing in the beginning, and it was super hot.

They held off the chase group of 17 riders by 38 seconds, and although Gasparrini lost contact at the 2km mark, she came back again and took the lead as they crossed the River Tweed on the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m over the moon. This was one of the races I was most excited to do this season, and I really wanted to come here in good form and show Britain how good I can be, and I think I proved that today,&#8221; said Ferguson after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really emotional, even talking about it now. It&#8217;s so lovely to have my family here, and it really is a team win, the team really supported me, and I feel so lucky to have them,&#8221; she continued.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We worked well together as a group, and I knew that if I positioned myself well into that final corner, I could probably win the sprint. It was useful that we&#8217;d done it before, in the intermediate sprint. I knew it was better to be second wheel and then launch first because you lose some momentum on the cobbles, and it&#8217;s hard to build it back up. So I didn&#8217;t look back and just kept going,&#8221; the 19-year-old described the sprint.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit nervous now, to be honest, it&#8217;s going to be a rough night&#8217;s sleep, I think. I really want to hold on to this jersey that I didn&#8217;t think I would be in, so we have to look and make a plan to hold on to it for tomorrow. We&#8217;ll see how it goes around the streets of Glasgow, I&#8217;ve raced there before, and we&#8217;ve got a strong and motivated team. We&#8217;ll do our best to defend it,&#8221; Ferguson said about the upcoming final stage.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting and finishing in Kelso, the stage consisted of a longer and a shorter loop around the Scottish Borders for a distance of 143.8 km. The longer loop included the climbs of Scott&#8217;s View, Dingleton, and Dunion Hill, with the first two being climbed again on the shorter loop.</p>\n<p>The peloton stayed together over the first ascent of Scott&#8217;s View, with Dominika W≈Çodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) taking maximum QOM points. Overnight leader Kristen Faulkner (EF Education) suffered a mechanical and changed to the bike of her teammate Babette van der Wolff.</p>\n<p>Amber Kraak (FDJ-Suez) attacked on the Dingleton climb, cresting it a few seconds ahead of the chasing peloton but was caught a couple of kilometres later. After a flurry of unsuccessful attacks, the pace dropped again, allowing Faulkner and other dropped riders to return.</p>\n<p>It started to rain heavily as the stage went on, and W≈Çodarczyk was first at the top again which made her the leader of the QOM classification when Mara Roldan (Picnic PostNL) crashed out of the race.</p>\n<p>This happened on a wet descent with 56km to go. Roldan was in third position going into a right-hand turn but slipped and crashed, immediately followed by dozens of other riders including Faulkner, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime), and Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal).</p>\n<p>The race had split completely because of the mass crash, and it took a while before riders came back to form a peloton of just over riders. Wollaston won the intermediate sprint in Kelso ahead of Ferguson and C√©lia Gery (FDJ-Suez), but the descent saw another crash where, among others, Faulkner went to the ground again. She had to switch one of her shoes afterwards and was on the back foot from there on, eventually finishing over three minutes behind and dropping out of the GC race.</p>\n<p>Up front, Uttrup Ludwig attacked on the second ascent of Dingleton, initiating the decisive move. Unfortunately for the Dane, she lost contact with the other five due to her mechanical, and the last 20km were a long-range chase between the frontrunners and the next group on the road ‚Äì with the front group going all the way to the finish where Ferguson won the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was perfect. In the end, she told me to attack and go for it. I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The opening stage at the Volta Ciclista a Catalunya Femenina offered a hilly 114.4km from El Perello to Reus with three categorised ascents at Coll del Guix (14.6km at 3.2%), Coll de Porrera (3.3km at 6.8%) and Coll d&#8217;Alforia (5km at 4.6%), followed by mostly descending all the way into Reus.</p>\n<p>The first separation from the peloton was by US rider Allison Mrugal (Cynisca Cycling) and South American Agua Maria Espinola (Team Farto-Kiroot), but went no farther than the 30 kilometres.

A further six seconds down, Ally Wollaston (FDJ-Suez) led home the next group on the road.</p>\n<p>After finishing ninth place among Wollaston&#8217;s chase group, Kristen Faulkner (EF Education-Oatly) takes over the green jersey of race leader from stage 1 winner Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal). </p>\n<p>The American racer now leads Markus by four seconds, while Wollaston is in third overall at 12 seconds. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Today still hasn&#8217;t fully sunk in! It was a hard and aggressive race as soon as we hit the circuit, but we rode really well as a team, always together and in position for the key moments,&#8221; Roldan said after her win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After yesterday&#8217;s disappointing mechanical and losing time on GC, I came into today super motivated, and so did the girls. We were fully committed to the plan. The team set me up perfectly going into the second lap, and I attacked on the steepest part of the climb.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As soon as I got a gap, I knew I had to commit and give it everything to the line. It was still a long way ‚Äì 15km ‚Äì but Callum in the car kept me motivated, and I dug deep all the way to the finish. I&#8217;m so thankful to all the girls for their hard work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a special feeling to take this win, especially as it&#8217;s my first in the Women&#8217;s WorldTour. It gives us so much confidence going forward, not just for the next two days of this race, but for the rest of the season!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStarting in Hartlepool, the stage looped around Teesside before ending with almost two laps of a circuit around Saltburn-by-the-Sea that included the Marske Lane climb and the climb up Saltburn Bank, finishing about 400 metres after the top for a total of 114.3km.</p>\n<p>Green jersey Le Court went down in a crash only a few minutes into the race, but fortunately, she could get back on her bike and continue the race.</p>\n<p>After 5km, Tiffany Keep (DAS-Hutchinson) went on the attack, and when Madeleine Leech (Handsling Alba Development) and Lucy Gadd (Smurfit Westrock) bridged to her, the break of the day was established.</p>\n<p>Their advantage maxed out at just over three minutes before the peloton started the chase. At the intermediate sprint in Guisborough, where Keep sprinted for the points, the gap was down to 2:04 minutes.</p>\n<p>Keep kept on going after the sprint, and Gadd came back to her while Leech dropped back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>Keep left Gadd behind on the way up Marske Lane and was first over the top, but the peloton was only 10 seconds down as Anouska Koster (Uno-X Mobility) just passed Gadd at the QOM sprint.</p>\n<p>With 30km to go, Keep&#8217;s breakaway was over. The peloton was down to about 60 riders, and Anna Henderson (Lidl-Trek) tried to get away over the rolling hills. A crash in a wet corner took down Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) and split the peloton, with Le Court in the second group.</p>\n<p>Deignan led into Saltburn Bank with one lap to go until Faulkner took over with Cat Ferguson and Henderson on her wheel.</p>\n<p>Henderson attacked 150 metres from the finish line in a bid for the time bonuses but missed out as Faulkner, Ferguson, and Karlijn Swinkels passed her on the line. Le Court was in a group 53 seconds down, with Wiebes even further behind.</p>\n<p>Picnic PostNL took charge and pushed the pace in the lead group with five riders, setting up Roldan&#8217;s attack on Marske Lane, where the 21-year-old Canadian gained a 20-second gap on the 15 riders that remained together behind her.</p>\n<p>Markus jumped away from that group on one of the brief descents in the rolling last 13km and inched towards Roldan on her own, reducing the gap to only nine seconds at one point. But Roldan kept going and held Markus at around 10 seconds up until the flamme rouge, where the climb of Saltburn Bank began.</p>\n<p>The Canadian gave it her all, attacking the climb with an open mouth and fervently pushing the pedals while Markus had a steadier pace. At the top of the climb, Roldan was sure of the victory but never slowed down, only celebrating after crossing the finish line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9063&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Mauritian crossed the QOM line five seconds ahead of Faulkner, with what remained of the peloton at 27 seconds.</p>\n<p>Faulkner joined Le Court on the descent, and behind them a chase group of 20 riders formed that was led by FDJ-Suez, later joined by Movistar. However, they didn‚Äôt make inroads on the gap to the front duo, who were 30 seconds ahead at the intermediate sprint in Newton-under-Roseberry.</p>\n<p>Eight km from the finish, the gap was still 24 seconds, and as they reached the coastal road with 2.5km to go, Le Court and Faulkner could be confident they would sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>Although the sprinters came closer in the end, Le Court beat Faulkner in the sprint to win by five seconds ahead of the chase group that was led home by Wiebes.

Between 2005 and 2018, it was organised as a 2.1 race on the UCI Europe Tour. The 2019 edition was classified as a 2.HC race. It became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco AlUla) won stage 1 of the Tour of Slovenia, launching a powerful sprint to the line in ≈†kofljica for just his second victory of the season.</p>\n<p>The Dutch champion was perfectly led into the final corner by his teammates in purple, however, he could sense it was too early. He then latched onto the final two riders of UAE Team Emirates-XRG&#8217;s train for the final sprint, before holding on to the line after kicking out of Ivo Oliveira&#8217;s slipstream with 150 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Groenewegen was able to celebrate just past the finish, before sitting down in the shade, exhausted from his effort, with Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain Victorious) taking second and Manuel Pe√±alver (Polti VisitMalta) finishing third a bike length behind.</p>\n<p>Tim Torn Teutenberg (Lidl-Trek) was perfectly placed to challenge the big Dutchman in his wheel, but couldn&#8217;t match his kick in the final, with Groenewegen adding to his win last month from the Tour of Hungary.</p>\n<p>He leads the race overall by one second from Fabio Christen (Q36.5 Pro Cycling), whose day in the early breakaway saw him take nine bonus seconds on the road. Groenewegen will likely have a chance to double his win tally Thursday on the undulating stage to Roga≈°ka Slatina.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The best position was in the wheel of Max [Walscheid], but these long straights into the last two corners were really important to have a good position,&#8221; said Groenewegen as he recalled the finish. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We were fighting a bit with UAE. Max took the perfect corner, but I was a little bit in between the UAE guys, so they let a gap go in the last corner. I went to the wheel, continued my sprint, and luckily it was enough. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was not my best day on the bike, because I was a bit sick three days before, but I recovered well, and I think it will be better every day now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy with how we did as the team, and really happy with the victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=211&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=211&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Ladies Tour of Norway ran from 2014 to 2021. </p>\n<p>Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) used a solo breakaway to capture a signature victory on stage 2 of Tour of Norway Women, simultaneously netting the overall title on home soil. </p>\n<p>Clad in the colours of Norwegian national champion, Ottestad caught and passed lone attacker Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit Pro Cycling) with 22km to go and continued for a double celebration in the two-day race. </p>\n<p>Susanne Andersen was best in the bunch sprint, 50 seconds after her Uno-X teammate had crossed the line and thus took second place on the stage, ahead of Margot Vanpachtenbeke (VolkerWessels Women&#8217;s Pro Cycling). </p>\n<p>Stage 1 winner and race leader Justine Ghekiere (AG Insurance-Soudal) finished in the chase group of 13 riders in sixth place, and relented the overall to Ottestad by 44 seconds.

A crash on the first lap separated the peloton into several groups, but the front two groups were back together for the second of the five circuits.</p>\n<p>AG Insurance-Soudal set the pace over the second pass of the category 3 climb and 73km to go, with race leader Ghekiere the first over the top. Visma-Lease a Bike and Uno-X Mobility amped up the charge on the other side for the first intermediate sprint points, Uno&#8217;X&#8217;s Andersen ahead of Visma&#8217;s Eva Van Agt.</p>\n<p>With 63km to go Maud Rijnbeek (VolkerWessles Cycling) went on a brief solo attack, but her surge was over 9km later. Hengeveld took over at the front, and soon had a 1:40 gap.</p>\n<p>With 44km and two laps to go, Hengeveld&#8217;s lead began to shrink, thanks to the duo of Vikt√≥ria Chlado≈àova (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Ottestad, who had closed to just under one minute, Chladonov√° taking 2 bonus seconds and Ottestad 1.</p>\n<p>The peloton began the penultimate lap 1:20 back and whittled the time back slowly.</p>\n<p>With 25km to go, Ottestad was alone in the chase and had Hengeveld in her sights, making the catch for the final lap. She then powered away at the front of her home race, Hengeveld having no response. </p>\n<p>AG Insurance-Soudal drove the pace of the peloton for the race leader, focused on closing a 48-second gap to the lone leader, but they could not close down the move.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24907&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24907&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24907&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=24907&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Just 24 hours after his epic ride into pink across the Colle delle Finestre, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) has clinched the overall victory in the 2025 Giro d&#8217;Italia ahead of Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>The final stage, a flat run starting and finishing in Rome on Sunday evening, ended with a bunch sprint victory for Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike), giving the Dutchman his second win of the race and Yates&#8217; team yet another reason to celebrate in the Giro.</p>\n<p>Yates&#8217; overall victory came after he launched a courageous last-ditch attack on the interminable, untarmacked slopes of the Colle delle Finestre on stage 20, ending an 11-day spell in the lead for Del Toro. The British racer completed the Giro safely in the main pack, nearly four minutes ahead Del Toro and almost five up on Carapaz.</p>\n<p>The points classification was won by Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), while Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) claimed the mountains ranking and Del Toro gained the victory in the best young rider&#8217;s competition.</p>\n<p>But the main spotlight in Rome on Sunday evening was firmly on Visma-Lease a Bike and Yates, whose victory in the Giro d&#8217;Italia is his second Grand Tour win after taking the Vuelta a Espa√±a back in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t wish for a better final weekend,&#8221; Kooij said afterwards. &#8220;Yesterday [Saturday] was really amazing for the team and today I had to give everything that was left in the legs.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My teammates made it a lot easier, I just had to push it all the way to the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yates captured the maglia rosa on an epic mountain stage Saturday, and rolled safely into Rome to officially win the overall on Sunday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still sinking in, what a huge moment this is for my career,&#8221; Yates said afterwards, &#8220;probably the defining moment. I&#8217;m just incredibly proud of my team and Olav just finished it off. It&#8217;s been an amazing three weeks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We kept the focus, we knew we had a good chance with Olav today and somehow we pulled it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had some good successes but I don&#8217;t think anything comes close to this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe stage began in a sombre mood, a minute of silence held by the entire peloton to mark the death from late last week of Daisy, the wife of former longstanding Visma-Lease a Bike rider Robert Gesink, following a short illness. </p>\n<p>Then there was a lengthy early neutralised segment, which saw the peloton pass through the parks of the Vatican City to hear a brief speech from Pope Leo XIV, flanked by the classification leaders. Once the riders remounted, they then headed out of the Vatican and back to Italy and racing, for one last time in this year&#8217;s Giro d&#8217;Italia got underway.</p>\n<p>The first few kilometres were raced extremely gently, though with the usual final stage multiple photo oppsortunities, on-bike glasses of champagne for the winner and his team and broad smiles all round.</p>\n<p>The stage then headed down to the Tyrrhenian coastline near Rome at the same gentle pace, before a nominal outbreak of hostilities at an intermediate sprint at Fontana dello Zodiaco. Dries de Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) secured second place behind Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta), enough to secure victory in that particular rankings, then Visma began to control affairs at the head of the bunch as the last part of the stage approached.</p>\n<p>After crossing the finish line for the first time as eight loops of a finishing 9.5km circuit commenced, Australian Michael Hepburn (Jayco-AlUla) was the first to try and defy the sprinters&#8217; teams. He was then joined by Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ), Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Josef ƒåerny (Soudal-QuickStep), Andrea Pietrobon (Polti-VisitMalta), and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) to open up a gap of 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>Into the final 50 kilometres of the Giro, the six breakaways continued ahead, but Visma-Lease a Bike, though, were happy to keep them fairly closely under control, boosted by support from Picnic-PostNL and Alpecin-Deceuninck, while Lidl-Trek were notable by their absence from the front end of affairs..</p>\n<p>A 2020 Giro third week breakaway stage winner, ƒåerny continued to blast away at speed, and as the six riders&#8217; margin unexpectedly widened to over 30 seconds on a warm, near-summer evening, the pace grew even higher. ƒåerny briefly broke away after he and Harper tussled for the last Red Bull sprint of the race, the Australian being successful, but he was unable to gain much of an advantage. That sustained acceleration nonetheless meant Pietrobon was the first to throw in the towel and Hepburn followed suit with two laps to go, even as Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale provided extra support to the other fastmen&#8217;s teams to bring in the remnants of the break.</p>\n<p>Verre, Paleni and ƒåerny ploughed on regardless of their depleted numbers and they still had 15 seconds as they tackled the slight rises, occasional section of cobbles, and the few more technical, narrow segments of the circuit in central Rome. Thankfully the weather was dry, reducing the risk of crashes.</p>\n<p>Paleni forged on oblivious of the shrinking gap, with ƒåerny his only companion as they entered the last lap and the Czech then went solo eight kilometres from the line, finally surrendering to the inevitable two kilometres further on.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck swept to the front of the bunch as they shot past ƒåerny, points leader Mads Pedersen also briefly pulling into view on the righthand side of the pack. Tudor and Decathlon, the latter riding for Sam Bennett, were also present in numbers as they sped alongside the side of the mighty River Tiber.</p>\n<p>However, Visma-Lease a Bike continued to dominate the stage at their pleasure, with Wout van Aert setting the tempo on a nasty last little rise early in the final kilometre, then Edouardo Affini maintaining the pace on the slight downhill that followed. All of this ensured Kooij was ideally placed for the closing metres and he was more than ready to respond.</p>\n<p>Kooij launched his move late, and Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5) provided an initial challenge, only to fade almost within sight of the line. Meanwhile Naples stage winner Kaden Groves then made a ferocious last acceleration that pulled the Australian into second, although he was a little blocked in as well. </p>\n<p>But even as Groves made his final lunge for the line, Kooij was already under the finishing gantry, with his second stage victory of the race and his team&#8217;s third comfortably in the bag. With Yates overall triumph to celebrate as well, Visma-Lease a Bike were certainly finishing the 2025 Giro d&#8217;Italia in the best way possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Tudor and Decathlon, the latter riding for Sam Bennett, were also present in numbers as they sped alongside the side of the mighty River Tiber.</p>\n<p>However, Visma-Lease a Bike continued to dominate the stage at their pleasure, with Wout van Aert setting the tempo on a nasty last little rise early in the final kilometre, then Edouardo Affini maintaining the pace on the slight downhill that followed. All of this ensured Kooij was ideally placed for the closing metres and he was more than ready to respond.</p>\n<p>Kooij launched his move late, and Matteo Moschetti (Q36.5) provided an initial challenge, only to fade almost within sight of the line. Meanwhile Naples stage winner Kaden Groves then made a ferocious last acceleration that pulled the Australian into second, although he was a little blocked in as well. </p>\n<p>But even as Groves made his final lunge for the line, Kooij was already under the finishing gantry, with his second stage victory of the race and his team&#8217;s third comfortably in the bag. With Yates overall triumph to celebrate as well, Visma-Lease a Bike were certainly finishing the 2025 Giro d&#8217;Italia in the best way possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>The Giro d&#8217;Italia was turned on its head on Saturday as Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) dropped race leader Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) on the interminable slopes of the Colle delle Finestre to clinch the maglia rosa with just one flat stage left.</p>\n<p>Having lost the Giro on the same climb to Chris Froome (Israel-Premier Tech) seven years ago, 2018 Vuelta winner Yates will head into Rome on Sunday with a second Grand Tour victory safely in his pocket, barring disaster.</p>\n<p>Heading into the stage 1:31 down, Yates finished on the final Alpine stage of the Giro behind the day&#8217;s winner, Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) and Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), to move ahead of both Del Toro and second-placed Richard Carapaz.</p>\n<p>The Briton attacked 13 kilometres from the summit of the Finestre and had an advantage of nearly two minutes by the top, where Del Toro might have been able to regain contact had the team&#8217;s tactics been better considered.</p>\n<p>However, Yates was able to count on valuable support from teammate Wout van Aert after he linked up with the Belgian star, who was part of the early breakaway. While Del Toro was able to shadow Carapaz all the way up the climb, on the descent there was no reciprocal collaboration from the Mexican and the two ended up drifting away from the overall win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think when the route of the parcours was released, I always had in the back of my mind to try and do something here and close the chapter, let&#8217;s say,&#8221; a visibly emotional Yates said afterwards. &#8220;I&#8217;m just still a bit speechless that I was able to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good, the whole race I did, but I never had the right moment to show what I could do and I found the opportunity today. I was trying to get away from Richard and Isaac because I knew when I could race at my own pace, I&#8217;d be really strong, and that&#8217;s what I managed to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole team have been fantastic the entire race, and without Wout in the valley and the rest of the team the entire day, it wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Maybe I was looking relaxed this morning, but I had doubts I could do it. The guys encouraged me, though, and believed in me, so thanks to them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable, I&#8217;m trying to find the words now, but words are failing me &#8211; sorry.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Victory for Harper</strong><br />\nChris Harper handed Jayco-AlUla their second stage win of the race, attacking from the breakaway to leave Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) to finish second on the epic stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mentally and physically it&#8217;s been a challenging Giro,&#8221; Harper said afterwards after he secured Jayco-AlUla&#8217;s second stage win of the race. &#8220;I came here looking for GC and I was feeling good in the first week, but then I got sick on the second rest day and slipped off of GC. After that, I was looking for a stage win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m happier about, getting a stage win or seeing Yatesy win pink. He&#8217;s an awesome guy, I had the pleasure of racing with him for a couple of seasons and I don&#8217;t think anyone deserves the pink jersey more than him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA flurry of early attacks created a first opening break with unusual speed for this year&#8217;s Giro d&#8217;Italia, allowing seven riders to forge a gap after barely a couple of kilometres. Timo Kielich (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ), Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers), Jacopo Mosca (Lidl-Trek) and Gianmarco Garofoldi, perhaps celebrating the renewal of his contract on Friday with Soudal-QuickStep, all made the initial cut.</p>\n<p>Realising they were running out of options as the Giro&#8217;s finish looms, and despite Heiduk&#8217;s protests at a lack of collaboration in the front group, a chasing group comprising Francesco Busatto (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mads Pedersen and Carlos Verona (both Lidl-Trek), Jon Barrenetxea (Movistar), Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep) and Manuel Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) then added their power to the early break. But even more reinforcements were yet to come.</p>\n<p>At 163 kilometres to go, an even bigger group made it over to the front: Quinten Hermans and Jimmy Janssens (both Alpecin-Deceuninck); Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels&#8217; Alessandro Verre; Pello Bilbao and Fran Miholjeviƒá (both Bahrain Victorious); Andrea Vendram√© (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale); Kevin Geniets, Quentin Pacher and R√©my Rochas (all Groupama-FDJ); Kevin Colleoni (Intermarch√©-Wanty); Simon Clarke (Israel-Premier Tech); Jefferson Cepeda (Movistar); Milan Vader (Tudor); Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla); Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL); Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta); Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®). It was a huge, 31-rider group, but with the Finestre as the main challenge of the day, whether anybody in the break would stay away to the line was anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>\n<p>For the next two hours, as bunch and breakaway trundled over the category 4 Corio and raced onwards towards the Colle del Lys, things evolved into an uneventful holding pattern. The 31 riders ahead pushed the lead up to nearly nine minutes before EF Education-EasyPost began chasing behind, presumably toughening things up for Carapaz. On the long, grinding ascent of the category 2 Colle del Lys, the gap began to shrink a little, sparking some exits from the back of the peloton amongst the sprinters. </p>\n<p>EF collectively had their hearts in their mouths when one of their riders misjudged a corner and the rest almost came off as a result, the incident looked far worse than it actually was, and there was no further drama.</p>\n<p>The incident allowed the breakaway to gain a potentially invaluable extra couple of minutes for the fast-approaching Finestre. Not even the addition of Israel-Premier Tech to the chase in the bunch and a major acceleration towards the climb seemed able to dent their advantage.</p>\n<p>Come the foot of the make-or-break Finestre ascent and its relentless gradient of 9% or higher, the break still had a cushion of over 10 minutes, with Lidl-Trek working as hard as possible for a second win for Verona. Pedersen pushed the pace early on the 18.5-kilometre ascent, rapidly shredding the group to a third of its original 31-man size. Finally, as Verona radioed to his team from the back of the group that he was struggling, a group formed under Rochas&#8217; impetus. Then, 16 kilometres from the top, the Harper went clear with Verre.</p>\n<p>EF, meanwhile, were using Rafferty, Steinhauser and Cepeda to kick as hard as possible right from the bottom, slicing through the peloton with a vengeance. Then suddenly and almost from the foot of the climb, after days when his attacks came too late, Carapaz kicked on hard from the gun, forcing Del Toro to react hard to get up to his back wheel.</p>\n<p>The Giro GC battle looked briefly as if it had come down to two, but Carapaz&#8217;s steady pace allowed Yates to bridge across, even while it was notable how Del Toro was unable to react. </p>\n<p>Yates, meanwhile repeatedly attacked, with Carapaz once again reacting and finally 13 kilometres from the top, Yates delivered the key punch, and managed to go clear.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the gap between Yates and his chasers hovered at around 10 seconds, particularly as Gee bridged across and initially began to work behind. At first, Del Toro had a chance to protect his lead, but Gee fell behind, and Carapaz&#8217;s repeated moves did little to shake Del Toro. </p>\n<p>There were points when Carapaz waited for Del Toro to take over, even allowing Gee to regain contact and shoot past briefly. But the three continued to hesitate, locked together and effectively giving Del Toro a free ride. Their stop-start tactics were only giving Yates an inexorable advantage.</p>\n<p>As soon as Del Toro&#8217;s provisional lead of 1:21 had evaporated completely, he was all but forced to work. Yates, meanwhile, was on a roll, gobbling up one rider after another from the break, and pushing the gap up to nearly two minutes with four kilometres to go as he neared the summit. Ultimately, Gee&#8217;s diesel efforts saw his engine overheat, allowing Carapaz and Del Toro to go clear.</p>\n<p>At the summit, Harper went over the top with Verre at 1:38, Yates at 4:43, and Del Toro and Carapaz passing over at 6:23. Gee was a further minute back and the Giro still hanging in the balance. Del Toro is a demon descender, but Yates, crucially had found teammate Wout van Aert ahead. At the same time, after Del Toro asked &#8211; finally &#8211; for Carapaz to work, there was a visible moment of disagreement between the two, giving Yates even more of an advantage.</p>\n<p>Yates, meanwhile, soldiered on, even after Van Aert had to throw in the towel on the grinding final ascent to Sestri√®re. It had seemed like an impossible task, given both Carapaz and Del Toro had proved superior on both of the previous stages, but his attack on the Finestre proved to be more than enough. </p>\n<p>While del Toro had to face Gee and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) pulling away on the final slopes, Yates was able to push his advantage to a jaw-dropping 5:13.</p>\n<p>Barely a smile crossed his face as he closed in on victory, but he crossed the line in third with his head in his hands and then burst into tears after the finish, speaking volumes at the scale of his success. To do so on the same climb on which he had lost the Giro six years ago was poetic justice of the kind few sports can offer, but cycling is definitely amongst them.</p>\n<p>As for Del Toro, he and Carapaz continued to shadow each other all the way to the line, the Mexican only managing to sprint ahead a little after what remains a remarkable achievement for the UAE racer, given his youth. Both of them will remain on the podium, with Del Toro at 3.56 and Carapaz in third at 4:43. The day, though &#8211; and the 2025 Giro &#8211; both belonged firmly and all but definitively to Simon Yates.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>The Giro d&#8217;Italia was turned on its head on Saturday as Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) dropped race leader Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) on the interminable slopes of the Colle delle Finestre to clinch the maglia rosa with just one flat stage left.</p>\n<p>Having lost the Giro on the same climb to Chris Froome (Israel-Premier Tech) seven years ago, 2018 Vuelta winner Yates will head into Rome on Sunday with a second Grand Tour victory safely in his pocket, barring disaster.</p>\n<p>Heading into the stage 1:31 down, Yates finished on the final Alpine stage of the Giro behind the day&#8217;s winner, Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) and Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), to move ahead of both Del Toro and second-placed Richard Carapaz.</p>\n<p>The Briton attacked 13 kilometres from the summit of the Finestre and had an advantage of nearly two minutes by the top, where Del Toro might have been able to regain contact had the team&#8217;s tactics been better considered.</p>\n<p>However, Yates was able to count on valuable support from teammate Wout van Aert after he linked up with the Belgian star, who was part of the early breakaway. While Del Toro was able to shadow Carapaz all the way up the climb, on the descent there was no reciprocal collaboration from the Mexican and the two ended up drifting away from the overall win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think when the route of the parcours was released, I always had in the back of my mind to try and do something here and close the chapter, let&#8217;s say,&#8221; a visibly emotional Yates said afterwards. &#8220;I&#8217;m just still a bit speechless that I was able to do it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I felt good, the whole race I did, but I never had the right moment to show what I could do and I found the opportunity today. I was trying to get away from Richard and Isaac because I knew when I could race at my own pace, I&#8217;d be really strong, and that&#8217;s what I managed to do.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The whole team have been fantastic the entire race, and without Wout in the valley and the rest of the team the entire day, it wouldn&#8217;t have been possible. Maybe I was looking relaxed this morning, but I had doubts I could do it. The guys encouraged me, though, and believed in me, so thanks to them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unbelievable, I&#8217;m trying to find the words now, but words are failing me &#8211; sorry.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Victory for Harper</strong><br />\nChris Harper handed Jayco-AlUla their second stage win of the race, attacking from the breakaway to leave Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) to finish second on the epic stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Mentally and physically it&#8217;s been a challenging Giro,&#8221; Harper said afterwards after he secured Jayco-AlUla&#8217;s second stage win of the race. &#8220;I came here looking for GC and I was feeling good in the first week, but then I got sick on the second rest day and slipped off of GC. After that, I was looking for a stage win.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m happier about, getting a stage win or seeing Yatesy win pink. He&#8217;s an awesome guy, I had the pleasure of racing with him for a couple of seasons and I don&#8217;t think anyone deserves the pink jersey more than him.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA flurry of early attacks created a first opening break with unusual speed for this year&#8217;s Giro d&#8217;Italia, allowing seven riders to forge a gap after barely a couple of kilometres. Timo Kielich (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ), Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers), Jacopo Mosca (Lidl-Trek) and Gianmarco Garofoldi, perhaps celebrating the renewal of his contract on Friday with Soudal-QuickStep, all made the initial cut.</p>\n<p>Realising they were running out of options as the Giro&#8217;s finish looms, and despite Heiduk&#8217;s protests at a lack of collaboration in the front group, a chasing group comprising Francesco Busatto (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Mads Pedersen and Carlos Verona (both Lidl-Trek), Jon Barrenetxea (Movistar), Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep) and Manuel Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) then added their power to the early break. But even more reinforcements were yet to come.</p>\n<p>At 163 kilometres to go, an even bigger group made it over to the front: Quinten Hermans and Jimmy Janssens (both Alpecin-Deceuninck); Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels&#8217; Alessandro Verre; Pello Bilbao and Fran Miholjeviƒá (both Bahrain Victorious); Andrea Vendram√© (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale); Kevin Geniets, Quentin Pacher and R√©my Rochas (all Groupama-FDJ); Kevin Colleoni (Intermarch√©-Wanty); Simon Clarke (Israel-Premier Tech); Jefferson Cepeda (Movistar); Milan Vader (Tudor); Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla); Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL); Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta); Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®). It was a huge, 31-rider group, but with the Finestre as the main challenge of the day, whether anybody in the break would stay away to the line was anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>\n<p>For the next two hours, as bunch and breakaway trundled over the category 4 Corio and raced onwards towards the Colle del Lys, things evolved into an uneventful holding pattern. The 31 riders ahead pushed the lead up to nearly nine minutes before EF Education-EasyPost began chasing behind, presumably toughening things up for Carapaz. On the long, grinding ascent of the category 2 Colle del Lys, the gap began to shrink a little, sparking some exits from the back of the peloton amongst the sprinters. </p>\n<p>EF collectively had their hearts in their mouths when one of their riders misjudged a corner and the rest almost came off as a result, the incident looked far worse than it actually was, and there was no further drama.</p>\n<p>The incident allowed the breakaway to gain a potentially invaluable extra couple of minutes for the fast-approaching Finestre. Not even the addition of Israel-Premier Tech to the chase in the bunch and a major acceleration towards the climb seemed able to dent their advantage.</p>\n<p>Come the foot of the make-or-break Finestre ascent and its relentless gradient of 9% or higher, the break still had a cushion of over 10 minutes, with Lidl-Trek working as hard as possible for a second win for Verona. Pedersen pushed the pace early on the 18.5-kilometre ascent, rapidly shredding the group to a third of its original 31-man size. Finally, as Verona radioed to his team from the back of the group that he was struggling, a group formed under Rochas&#8217; impetus. Then, 16 kilometres from the top, the Harper went clear with Verre.</p>\n<p>EF, meanwhile, were using Rafferty, Steinhauser and Cepeda to kick as hard as possible right from the bottom, slicing through the peloton with a vengeance. Then suddenly and almost from the foot of the climb, after days when his attacks came too late, Carapaz kicked on hard from the gun, forcing Del Toro to react hard to get up to his back wheel.</p>\n<p>The Giro GC battle looked briefly as if it had come down to two, but Carapaz&#8217;s steady pace allowed Yates to bridge across, even while it was notable how Del Toro was unable to react. </p>\n<p>Yates, meanwhile repeatedly attacked, with Carapaz once again reacting and finally 13 kilometres from the top, Yates delivered the key punch, and managed to go clear.</p>\n<p>For a long time, the gap between Yates and his chasers hovered at around 10 seconds, particularly as Gee bridged across and initially began to work behind.

It is considered as a successor to the stage race Ringerike GP, which is now a one-day race. It was started in 2011 as a result of the heightened interest in cycling in Norway. The race is ranked 2.HC on the UCI Europe Tour, and is part of the new UCI ProSeries since 2020. From the 2019 season the race merged with Tour des Fjords to form a new six day stage race that covers all of the southern counties of Norway; the race had previously only been held in Eastern Norway. </p>\n<p>Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) was the fastest on the uphill sprint to claim the stage 2 victory and the overall race lead at the Tour of Norway.</p>\n<p>Brennan launched his sprint in the closing metres to cross the line ahead of runner-up Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-Bora- hansgrohe) and third-placed Victor Langellotti (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n<p>The Visma-Lease a Bike rider moved into the overall race lead now 12 seconds ahead of Langellotti and 15 seconds ahead of Tibor Del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck) as the race heads into stage 3 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The second stage at the Tour of Norway offered the field a 208.1km race from Egersund to Oltedal with a category 2 climb over Rundtjon (4.4km at 6.1%), a category 1 climb over Sirdalstoppen (15.9km at 2.4%) and a late-race category 3 climbs over Dirdal (1.8km at 8.3%) before a descent and then a short uphill to the finish line.</p>\n<p>An early breakaway of three emerged that included Kasper Haugland (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Development), Brage Aulstad (Lillehammer CK Continental) and Emil Toudal (Team ColoQuick). The trio gain more than six minutes on a large chasing group and an additional minute ahead of the main field.</p>\n<p>However, as the breakaway hit the 100km mark, their gap was slashed to four minutes as the chase group and peloton reconnected and pushed the pace in the approach to the base of the 15km Sirdalstoppen ascent.</p>\n<p>Jonas Walton (Project Echelon Racing) counter-attacked in an attempt to bridge to the leading trio.

I cannot believe I&#8217;m this guy &#8211; this is such an incredible thing. I cannot believe I was up there.

I waited a long time for a win &#8211; and I won my first race three weeks ago. And now I win here in the Giro d&#8217;Italia. I&#8217;m very happy. It was a goal with the team to win one stage, and now it&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Prodhomme was active throughout the stage, joining the breakaway on the first climb in the opening kilometres, then following the constantly changing situation until he took matters into his own hands, attacking at the top of the Col Saint-Pantal√©on to thin out the lead group.</p>\n<p>Then, with just two riders left by his side, Prodhomme attacked with 7.2km to go on the penultimate climb, the Col de Joux, and held on to win the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a lot of a gap. When I followed the first attack, my feeling was not very good &#8211; my legs were very bad on the first climb, it was very steep and hard. In the last climb, I could see the gap was not very big, and I needed to take a risk because before today, I had two top-fives because I didn&#8217;t take a lot of risks. But today I wanted to play for the win.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 19 signalled the beginning of the Giro d&#8217;Italia end game, with five massive climbs punctuating a brutal 166-kilometre route from Biella to Champoluc.</p>\n<p>The sun was out and the roads dry, but with temperatures soaring, the conditions made a rough day in the saddle even harder.</p>\n<p>The first climb, the category 3 Croce Serra, kicked up after just 3.7km of riding, and there was a lot of action on the ascent. Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked like a boomerang, jetting out the front only to be caught and dropped.</p>\n<p>EF Education-EasyPost were keen to put a rider in the breakaway to have support for Richard Carapaz, and sent Georg Steinhauser on the attack. He was joined by Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Jan Tratnik (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). They were joined by Bart Lemmen (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-Quickstep), but the breakaway hadn&#8217;t been established yet.</p>\n<p>Four men were left with a 30-second gap as they neared the summit: Cattaneo, Steinhauser, Lemmen and Prodhomme. Behind, a large group of chasers formed and reformed as Cattaneo led the breakaway over the climb.</p>\n<p>The action in the peloton continued on the descent and flat roads of the valley. Steinhauser led over the sprint in Pont-Saint-Martin, and in the peloton, Lidl-Trek made sure any chasers were caught so that Pedersen could sweep up the points for fifth.</p>\n<p>The sprint was a good excuse for another attack from the bunch, and Pedersen propelled teammates Carlos Verona, Patrick Konrad and Jacopo Mosca into the move before dropping back.</p>\n<p><strong>Col Tzecore and Col Saint-Pantal√©on</strong><br />\nThe 33 riders in the chase caught the four leaders as they started up the Col Tzecore, with most of the teams represented. Having missed the move, Intermarch√©-Wanty sent Louis Meintjes up the road with Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) to join the escape.</p>\n<p>Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) was the highest-placed rider in the move, in 15th place at 14:48 from Del Toro.</p>\n<p>Christian Scaroni (XDS Astana) led the large breakaway over the summit of the category 1 Col Tzecore to protect teammate Lorenzo Fortunato&#8217;s lead in the mountains classification.</p>\n<p>There was barely time to breathe before the next category 1 climb, the Col Saint-Pantal√©on began. The peloton eased up and let the breakaway gain 3:10 by the time they reached the valley.</p>\n<p>There was no peace treaty in the breakaway, and Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) launched an attack to thin out the group. He was joined by Tiberi, Prodhomme, Verona, Steinhauser, Meintjes, Lemmen and Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates XRG).</p>\n<p>Prodhomme attacked near the summit of the Col Saint-Pantal√©on, drawing out Verona, with Tiberi and Arrieta just behind. They had 2:00 on the maglia rosa group with Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), Lemmen, and Meintjes in no man&#8217;s land.</p>\n<p><strong>Col de Joux</strong><br />\nAfter a long descent, the breakaway started up the Col de Joux, the third category 1 ascent in a row. Verona and Tiberi surged into the base of the climb, and while Prodhomme scrambled across, Arrieta drifted back to the chase group.</p>\n<p>With no riders left in the attack, EF Education-EasyPost led the chase in the maglia rosa group, three minutes behind the leaders.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike took over control of the chase, steadily chipping away at the gap. With 10km to the summit of the Col de Joux, the leaders had less than two minutes. Sensing the pressure, Prodhomme kept pushing the pace, and it briefly became too much for Tiberi, but he put his head down and rode his way back to them.</p>\n<p>Prodhomme stuck the knife in soon after, attacking with 7.2km to the summit. He rapidly distanced Verona and Tiberi, but the pink jersey group was closing in, just 1:10 back.</p>\n<p>Verona and Tiberi sat up and were caught by the maglia rosa group, leaving the Frenchman on his own. As they came back, Giulio Pellizzari (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) made a probing attack, with Carapaz showing his cards by quickly following.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates were still well equipped with Rafa≈Ç Majka and Brandon McNulty setting the pace and shutting down the moves. Just 12 riders made up the chase group, with Tiberi joining teammate Damiano Caruso. Also, there were the rest of the top 10 on GC, barring Adam Yates, who fell off the pace on the lower slopes.</p>\n<p>With the UAE riders were Carapaz, Egan Bernal (Ineos), Einer Rubio (Movistar), Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), Michael Storer (Tudor), Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Pellizzari.</p>\n<p>Carapaz attacked in the last kilometre of the climb, quickly marked by Simon Yates and Del Toro. The surge gapped out Bernal, Rubio, Pellizzari and Storer, but UAE Team Emirates XRG shut the move down, and the pink jersey group came back together, chasing at just under a minute at the summit.</p>\n<p><strong>Antagnod</strong><br />\nPellizzari attempted an attack just before the KOM line atop the Col de Joux, but Majka shut him down and gestured for everyone to remain calm for the short descent.</p>\n<p>The easing of the pace allowed Prodhomme to gain more time, and he started the final climb, the category 2 Antagnod, with a 1:24 lead on the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>The pace was so steady that it seemed as if there would be no action from the GC contenders, but with 6.7km to go and 1.8km to the top, Carapaz launched a vicious acceleration.</p>\n<p>While Del Toro was quick to mark the Ecuadorian, Yates and Gee were left behind. The duo gained 15 seconds on the chase before Gee attacked and was unsuccessful in ditching his companions.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Prodhomme was riding out of his skin to keep his gap of one minute. Carapaz was forced to do all the work to cement his second place in the GC, as Del Toro was content to sit on.</p>\n<p>Prodhomme made it over the top with his gap still intact and cruised to the biggest result of his career, his first WorldTour victory and first Grand Tour stage win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=19&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=19&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) scored the seventh victory of his career with a late burst on stage 1 of the Boucles de la Mayenne.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman attacked with just over 1km to go on the rolling 166km stage from Saint-Berthevin to Juvign√© to catch the fastmen out and solo to the win, three seconds ahead of anyone else.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty) sped to second place ahead of Paul Penho√´t (Groupama-FDJ) in the bunch sprint.

It is considered as a successor to the stage race Ringerike GP, which is now a one-day race. It was started in 2011 as a result of the heightened interest in cycling in Norway. The race is ranked 2.HC on the UCI Europe Tour, and is part of the new UCI ProSeries since 2020. From the 2019 season the race merged with Tour des Fjords to form a new six day stage race that covers all of the southern counties of Norway; the race had previously only been held in Eastern Norway. </p>\n<p>Storm Ingebrigtsen (Team Coop-Repsol) was the last rider standing from an original breakaway, making it to the finish line by a whisker ahead of a chase group to claim the victory on stage 1 at the Tour of Norway.</p>\n<p>Ingebrigtsen was part of an original six rider breakaway that was reduced to three on the run in to the shorter finishing circuits where he launched an attack on his rivals to go solo into in Solakrossen.</p>\n<p>He crossed the line just three seconds ahead of a small chase group. Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) won the sprint for second ahead of Tibor Del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Ingebrigtsen also secured the event&#8217;s first leader&#8217;s jersey and he sits 11 seconds ahead of Brennan and an additional three seconds ahead of Del Grosso ahead of stage 2 on Friday.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe opening stage at the Tour of Norway offered the field a 179.2km route to and from Solakrossen. A relatively flat course with a gradual 7km climb at Seldalsbakken and a 1.8km climb at Helland before a flat run-in to the finishing circuits.</p>\n<p>The early breakaway emerged in the first 10km of racing that included Daniel √Örnes (Van Rysel Roubaix), Trym Brenns√¶ter (Tirol KTM Cycling), Ludvik Holstad (Lillehammer CK Continental), Eirik Vang Aas and Storm Ingebrigtsen (both Team Coop-Repsol), and Joshua Gudnitz (Team ColoQuick).</p>\n<p>The six riders pushed their lead out to more than three minutes at the halfway point of the race with Visma-Lease a Bike and Uno-X Mobility taking up the chase from the field behind.</p>\n<p>Brenns√¶ter was the first rider distanced from the breakaway over the Helland ascent as the gap to the five remaining escapees dropped to just over a minute with 65km left to race.</p>\n<p>A crash in the peloton resulted in separations among the main field, which split in two, with a front group of roughly 25 riders including Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility), Juan Sebastian Molano (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Brennan.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG did the lion&#8217;s share of the work at the front of the rsmall group holding the gap to the breakaway at 1:30 on the flat roads toward the Solakrossen circuits.</p>\n<p>The breakaway was reduced to just four as √Örnes, Vang Aas, Ingebrigtsen and Gudnitz held onto a slim 20-second lead into the final three kilometres.</p>\n<p>As the four raced into the final stretch, Ingebrigtsen launched his sprint first, as his rivals were caught and passed by a small chase group of nine. However, the Norwegian managed to hold off the chasers to claim the victory and the first leader&#8217;s jersey of the four-day event.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=71&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=71&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He then blasted clear alone  19 kilometres from the line to clinch the third Giro stage win of his career.</p>\n<p>Second, around 50 seconds back, was Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) with Edward Planckaert (Alpecin-Deceuninck) claiming third.</p>\n<p>The GC peloton finally rolled home more than 10 minutes down, with Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) not amongst their number. The Spaniard, already suffering an injured knee and stung by a bee on stage 17, abandoned after just 30 kilometres of racing.</p>\n<p>For Denz and Red Bull, though, there was a strong sense of redemption as the 31-year-old allrounder said afterwards, commenting that &#8220;this is probably the most emotional one [of my Giro stage victories] after losing Jai early on and then Primo≈æ.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We invested a lot, every in the whole team, not only the riders, we had the one big goal &#8211; to win the Giro d&#8217;Italia with Primo≈æ.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were at altitude for two months, now three months gone from home and I haven&#8217;t seen my wife and children.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you lose a leader like Primo≈æ you lose a dream and it feels like all this hard work is for nothing. But luckily we turned it around and could motivate ourselves, and winning on Father&#8217;s Day, too, by the way, is pretty special.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>While Ayuso struggled and finally capitulated in the early phase of the stage, Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) and Felix Engelhardt (Jayco-AlAla) were two of the most active riders as the race blasted past Lago di Como. But at least initially it looked very hard for any move to stick. Wave after wave of attacks went clear, and with no other transition stages left, it was clearly going to be a fight to the death for the early break.</p>\n<p>The presence of Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was not overly welcomed in the front group of some 40 riders and it came down to the category 2 ascent of Parlasco, the hardest climb of the day, for a definitive move to emerge at the front end of the race.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck, with Planckaert racing for Kaden Groves, were amongst those most determined to give it a go and keep it clear. Christian Scaroni (XDS Astana) briefly went solo and claimed maximum points at the top of the Parlasco, but he was never going anywhere alone. Finally, on the smaller chain of hills that followed, the chasing peloton relented, and 35 riders carved out enough time to stay away for good.</p>\n<p>The massive move comprised Denz (Red Bull); Groves, Planckaert and Fabio Van den Bossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck); Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-Samsic); Edoardo Zambanini (Bahrain Victorious); Stefano Oldani (Cofidis); Dries De Bondt, Dorion Godon, Stan Dewulf and Andrea Vendrame (all Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale); Remy Rochas (Groupama-FDJ); Francesco Busatto (Intermarche-Wanty); Daan Hoole, Matias Vacek and Mads Pedersen (all Lidl-Trek); Jon Barrenetxea (Movistar); Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep); Davide De Pretto and Felix Engelhardt (both Jayco-AlUla); Alexander Edmondson (Picnic-PostNL); Mattia Bais, Giovanni Lonardi and Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta); Wout van Aert and Dylan Van Baarle (Visma-Lease a Bike); Rick Pluimers, Yannis Voisard and Larry Warbasse (all Tudor); Filippo Magli, Martin Marcellusi and Manuele Tarozzi (all VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®); Diego Ulissi, Nicola Conci and Christian Scaroni (all XDS Astana). But despite its considerable size, with Ulissi the closest in the move on GC at over 40 minutes down, the break hardly constituted an overall threat. With two big mountain stages fast approaching, UAE Team Emirates XRG were more than content to let it go clear.</p>\n<p>By the time the break had more than six minutes advantage, it was clear that it would come down to the move to fight for the stage win. Rather than risk waiting with Pedersen and Groves leaving him no option in a sprint, Busatto opted to open up hostilities in the last of the foothills in the first half of the stage, jumping away with 62 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Another group of three, comprising Rochas and VF teammates Tarozzi and Marcellusi also chanced it, but with so much flat in the last part of the stage, waiting for the final finishing circuit &#8211; two and a half local laps of 12 kilometres in the Milan suburb of Cesano Maderno &#8211; was arguably the most practical pathway to success.</p>\n<p>With 30 kilometres to go, a dangerous move including Conci (XDS Astana), Planckaert (Alpecin-Deceuninck) Warbasse (Tudor), Van Baarle (Visma-Lease a Bike), Edmondson (Picnic-PostNL), De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Denz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Hoole (Lidl-Trek), De Pretto (Jayco-AlUla), Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) and Magli (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) emerged from the massive break of 35. Most importantly, Van Aert, Pedersen&#8217;s and Groves&#8217; teams were all represented in this group of stage leaders, meaning the biggest sprinters squads were under no obligation to chase.</p>\n<p>This instantly allowed those ahead to open up a gap of over a minute and with so much to play for an uneasy truce settled down amongst the 11 ahead as they concentrated on keeping their margin open. With some 18 kilometres to go, though, Denz opted for an early attack and he got away in style.</p>\n<p>A double winner in the 2023 Giro, both times from breakaways, Denz was clearly on a roll, and with GC leaders Rogliƒç and Hindley regrettably out of the picture, it was definitely the perfect moment for the Red Bull team workers to shine. De Bondt was quick enough to respond, but as the lap bell rang out with 12.8 kilometres to go, Denz was still 25 seconds ahead and looking like a man on a mission.</p>\n<p>While the chasers in the break continued to look at each other too hard and try and regain contact Denz had no such issues. One of the last to get to the break of 11 and one of the few riders with no teammates in the original massive move of 34, once he was on his own, he was clearly in his element. Warbasse tried to react alongside Maestri to at least secure a podium place, but with Denz showing no sign of weakening, getting any better result on the stage was an almost impossible task.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Primo≈æ left the Giro, I went through the route book and between the Mortirolo [on stage 17] and the Col de Finestre [on stage 20] there was only this stage that was possible for me,&#8221; Denz explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the plan and the freedom to go for today. I got in the break and then it was all about following my instincts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the final, there wasn&#8217;t much collaboration in the break and I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot. All on one card.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The peloton returns to the mountains on stage 19 for two last ultra-tough stages, where the GC battle will predominate. Red Bull won&#8217;t be fighting for the victory, and it remains to be seen if their promising young substitute contender Giulio Pellizzari can hang on to a top 10 finish, or maybe do even better. But come what may, Denz&#8217;s stage victory means Bora won&#8217;t be leaving the Giro empty-handed at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Finally, on the smaller chain of hills that followed, the chasing peloton relented, and 35 riders carved out enough time to stay away for good.</p>\n<p>The massive move comprised Denz (Red Bull); Groves, Planckaert and Fabio Van den Bossche (Alpecin-Deceuninck); Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-Samsic); Edoardo Zambanini (Bahrain Victorious); Stefano Oldani (Cofidis); Dries De Bondt, Dorion Godon, Stan Dewulf and Andrea Vendrame (all Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale); Remy Rochas (Groupama-FDJ); Francesco Busatto (Intermarche-Wanty); Daan Hoole, Matias Vacek and Mads Pedersen (all Lidl-Trek); Jon Barrenetxea (Movistar); Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep); Davide De Pretto and Felix Engelhardt (both Jayco-AlUla); Alexander Edmondson (Picnic-PostNL); Mattia Bais, Giovanni Lonardi and Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta); Wout van Aert and Dylan Van Baarle (Visma-Lease a Bike); Rick Pluimers, Yannis Voisard and Larry Warbasse (all Tudor); Filippo Magli, Martin Marcellusi and Manuele Tarozzi (all VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®); Diego Ulissi, Nicola Conci and Christian Scaroni (all XDS Astana). But despite its considerable size, with Ulissi the closest in the move on GC at over 40 minutes down, the break hardly constituted an overall threat. With two big mountain stages fast approaching, UAE Team Emirates XRG were more than content to let it go clear.</p>\n<p>By the time the break had more than six minutes advantage, it was clear that it would come down to the move to fight for the stage win. Rather than risk waiting with Pedersen and Groves leaving him no option in a sprint, Busatto opted to open up hostilities in the last of the foothills in the first half of the stage, jumping away with 62 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Another group of three, comprising Rochas and VF teammates Tarozzi and Marcellusi also chanced it, but with so much flat in the last part of the stage, waiting for the final finishing circuit &#8211; two and a half local laps of 12 kilometres in the Milan suburb of Cesano Maderno &#8211; was arguably the most practical pathway to success.</p>\n<p>With 30 kilometres to go, a dangerous move including Conci (XDS Astana), Planckaert (Alpecin-Deceuninck) Warbasse (Tudor), Van Baarle (Visma-Lease a Bike), Edmondson (Picnic-PostNL), De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Denz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Hoole (Lidl-Trek), De Pretto (Jayco-AlUla), Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) and Magli (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) emerged from the massive break of 35. Most importantly, Van Aert, Pedersen&#8217;s and Groves&#8217; teams were all represented in this group of stage leaders, meaning the biggest sprinters squads were under no obligation to chase.</p>\n<p>This instantly allowed those ahead to open up a gap of over a minute and with so much to play for an uneasy truce settled down amongst the 11 ahead as they concentrated on keeping their margin open. With some 18 kilometres to go, though, Denz opted for an early attack and he got away in style.</p>\n<p>A double winner in the 2023 Giro, both times from breakaways, Denz was clearly on a roll, and with GC leaders Rogliƒç and Hindley regrettably out of the picture, it was definitely the perfect moment for the Red Bull team workers to shine. De Bondt was quick enough to respond, but as the lap bell rang out with 12.8 kilometres to go, Denz was still 25 seconds ahead and looking like a man on a mission.</p>\n<p>While the chasers in the break continued to look at each other too hard and try and regain contact Denz had no such issues. One of the last to get to the break of 11 and one of the few riders with no teammates in the original massive move of 34, once he was on his own, he was clearly in his element. Warbasse tried to react alongside Maestri to at least secure a podium place, but with Denz showing no sign of weakening, getting any better result on the stage was an almost impossible task.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Primo≈æ left the Giro, I went through the route book and between the Mortirolo [on stage 17] and the Col de Finestre [on stage 20] there was only this stage that was possible for me,&#8221; Denz explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the plan and the freedom to go for today. I got in the break and then it was all about following my instincts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the final, there wasn&#8217;t much collaboration in the break and I thought I&#8217;d give it a shot. All on one card.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The peloton returns to the mountains on stage 19 for two last ultra-tough stages, where the GC battle will predominate. Red Bull won&#8217;t be fighting for the victory, and it remains to be seen if their promising young substitute contender Giulio Pellizzari can hang on to a top 10 finish, or maybe do even better. But come what may, Denz&#8217;s stage victory means Bora won&#8217;t be leaving the Giro empty-handed at all.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=18&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited.

It looked as though the stage would culminate in a three-man sprint to the line, but Del Toro had other ideas and put in one last move to go clear on the streets of Bormio.</p>\n<p>Carapaz didn‚Äôt have it in him to match the acceleration and shed four seconds ‚Äì plus six bonus seconds ‚Äì to the 21-year-old Mexican at the line as Bardet beat him to second place.</p>\n<p>Further back, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) led home the chase group at 15 seconds down, with Giulio Pellizzari (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) among those accompanying the Briton.</p>\n<p>Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) came home in the next group on the road, 1:10 down, while Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling) finished four minutes back. The big GC loser of the day, however, was Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), who lost even more time after dropping on the stage‚Äôs big climb, the Passo del Mortirolo.</p>\n<p>Del Toro now continues in the race lead with an extended 41-second lead over new second-placed rider Carapaz. The EF rider jumps above Yates, who now lies third at 51 seconds down. Gee, lying in fourth, is the only other rider within two minutes of the lead at 1:57 down.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI imagined that I could win a stage with the Maglia Rosa,‚Äù Del Toro said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe Giro has been very good so far. The fight for the podium is incredible and today I realised that I will never give up. I will always try to win. I have nothing to lose. It wasn‚Äôt any easier today than yesterday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWith the team, we expected some attacks to take place on the Mortirolo. We didn‚Äôt want to let all the GC riders go. I went across to them and I took it easy a bit. I caught them in the descent. We had made this plan with the team that I would attack on the last small climb.‚Äù</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nStage 17 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia saw the peloton continue with another challenging mountain stage, this time taking in 155km of racing between San Michele all‚ÄôAdige and Bormio.</p>\n<p>Three major climbs lay on the route ‚Äì the second-category Passo del Tonale (15.2km at 6%), the first-category Passo del Mortirolo (12.6km at 7.6%), and the third-category Le Motte (3.1km at 8%), 9km from the finish.</p>\n<p>On a day potentially suited to a big breakaway battle for the stage victory, it was no surprise to see a multitude of attacks fly. Riders including Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike), and Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) tried moves during the rising opening 20km, but nothing got away before the intermediate sprint at Cles at 23.5km.</p>\n<p>There, Pedersen hit the front again to beat Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) to the line and add another 12 points to his mammoth maglia ciclamino total. The attacks continued shortly afterwards, with the road still rising towards the base of the Passo del Tonale.</p>\n<p>Pedersen was on the move again, this time accompanied by a host of others as the break finally got away. In total, 39 riders made the move, with Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) easily the best-placed man on GC out front, the American lying 7:43 off the race lead.</p>\n<p>Maglia azzurra Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) was unsurprisingly in the group, as were numerous other strong climbers, including Bardet, Steven Kruijswijk (Visma-Lease a Bike), Dani Mart√≠nez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), and Filippo Zana (Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n<p>The peloton, aside from Polti-VisitMalta, who had missed the move, was happy with the composition of the group, and let the break ride three minutes up the road on the early slopes of the Tonale.</p>\n<p>Up the road, the break quickly blew apart on the climb, with an acceleration by Fortunato putting the weaker climbers out the rear before the midway point. Having split in half on the way up, around 25 men were back at the front at the top of the climb.</p>\n<p>Fortunato put in another acceleration across the summit to add 18 points to his KOM total. With 337 points on the board, he enjoyed a massive 212-point lead over Astana teammate Cristian Scaroni, while Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) lay in third with just 54 points.</p>\n<p>On the way down, the break‚Äôs lead grew out to four minutes, with Visma-Lease a Bike‚Äôs climbers Kruijswijk, Bart Lemmen, and Wilco Kelderman leading the way onto the fearsome Mortirolo.</p>\n<p>The break, and the chasing peloton, quickly shattered on the way up as the harsh gradients bit. Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) and Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) were notable names dropping from the peloton during the early slopes of the climb with over 50km left to run.</p>\n<p>At the front, Fortunato tried another move midway up the climb, though a counter-attack from Mart√≠nez proved stronger. The Colombian flew past and established a 20-second lead before he was joined by Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) 4km from the top.</p>\n<p>More riders, including Fortunato, Cattaneo, Bardet, McNulty, Efonso Eul√°lio (Bahrain Victorious), and Florian Stork (Tudor) came across before the summit, with Eul√°lio ‚Äì responding to a move by Bardet ‚Äì leading the race over the top and going solo on the descent.</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, the GC action was kicking off as Giulio Pellizzari (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) mounted the first attack from the much-reduced group.</p>\n<p>Riders including race leader Isaac del Toro, Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike), and Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) struggled to hang on, and were put deeper in trouble when Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) launched a move of his own close to the summit.</p>\n<p>The Ecuadorian‚Äôs attack saw no reaction from behind, though he wouldn‚Äôt stay away for long, even as teammate Georg Steinhauser dropped back from the break to help. Carapaz was brought back to the GC group on the way down, the riders lying 2:30 from the front of the race heading into the final 50km.</p>\n<p>On the descent, things came back together at the front, with Eulalio caught back by the chasers. Bardet, Fortunato, Cattaneo, Kelderman, and Stork linked up with the Portuguese rider, with Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) also coming across to make it an eight-man group.</p>\n<p>Back in the GC group of 20 riders or so, the gap to the break only diminished as UAE and Q36.5 put in work on the front. At the Red Bull Kilometre is Le Prese, 25km from the line, it was down to 1:40.</p>\n<p>From there, UAE continued to push on towards Le Motte, shaving second after second from the breakaway‚Äôs advantage. On the climb itself, a short but sharp test before a downhill run to Bormio, they brought it under 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Bardet put in one last-ditch attack from the break as the remainder of the move was brought back by the GC men. Behind him, only Cattaneo could hold off the charge behind. He‚Äôd soon be caught and passed, too, however, as Del Toro launched towards the top of the climb.</p>\n<p>The Mexican, responding to a move from Rubio, shot past the Colombian, taking Carapaz with him as the pair left the rest of the GC hopefuls in their dust, with Bernal and Pidcock having already dropped from the group.</p>\n<p>Heading down the descent and into the final 7km, the pair trailed Bardet by 10 seconds, but the gap was only closing as the riders raced towards Bormio. At 5.5km to go, the Frenchman was caught before latching onto the rear.</p>\n<p>Back down the road, Yates, Pellizzari, Rubio, Eulalio, Caruso, and Gee chased with a 20-second deficit. They wouldn‚Äôt make it back to the leaders before the line, though, and had to fight to the finish to limit their losses.</p>\n<p>Del Toro and Carapaz looked set to duke it out for the stage win, but it was the race leader who made the decisive move 1.7km from the line.

He put in another attack, this time on a descent, to catch Carapaz out and snatch precious seconds, and a career-first Grand Tour stage victory to boot.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>A massive upheaval in the Giro d&#8217;Italia overall has seen Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) cling onto pink by less than 30 seconds after rivals Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) and Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) launched major attacks on the final ascent of the day.</p>\n<p>The 202km monster Alpine stage was won by Christian Scaroni after he and teammate Lorenzo Fortunato moved away from a break five kilometres to go, ending Italy&#8217;s longest drought on stage victories since 2017 with a spectacular two-up victory for XDS Astana.</p>\n<p>But the big news of the day long-term came in the GC battle as first Primoz Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) crashed for a fourth time in the race, and abandoned, while Del Toro&#8217;s teammate Juan Ayuso, previously third overall, lost all chance of overall victory after he cracked on the second last climb, the Santa Barbara.</p>\n<p>Del Toro then was forced into serious defensive mode on the final ascent of San Valentino when Carapaz seared his way clear, and things looked even worse when Simon Yates followed suit and dropped the struggling maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>The Mexican clung on bravely to cross the line 1:36 down on Carapaz. But overall, with Yates now shortening the gap to just 26 seconds and Carapaz at 31 seconds, as UAE&#8217;s grip on the overall falters notably, the Giro is looking more wide open than ever.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy about it,&#8221;  stage winner Scaroni said, &#8220;Me and Fortunato felt really good right from the start, and even when it rained I felt really good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We dropped all the other riders and I wasn&#8217;t sure if Carapaz would catch us. Then in the last kilometre I was really suffering, but we stayed together, and this victory is for the team.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first news of the opening leg of week 3 of the 2025 Giro d&#8217;Italia was not even about the stage itself, rather who was taking part. After his crash-ridden opening fortnight and ensuing time losses, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) surprisingly confirmed his presence, only for disaster to strike later on. </p>\n<p>Then, when racing got underway, seven riders broke away almost immediately despite the appalling weather, amongst them Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Darren Rafferty (EF Education-EasyPost), Lorenzo Germani (Groupama-FDJ), Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers), Jon Barrenetxea (Movistar), Mikel Azparren (Q36.5) and Josef Cerny (Soudal-Quick Step). Tarling was forced to abandon after crashing on a roundabout in the first hour, but the other six ploughed on through the rain.</p>\n<p>XDS Astana were not overly happy at the prospect of mountains leader Lorenzo Fortunato losing ground to rivals, though, and they launched a major counter-move, allowing a further 18 riders to come across to the day&#8217;s leaders. Fortunato was amongst them, logically, but also teammates Fausto Masnada and Christian Scaroni, as well as Luca Covili and Alessio Martinelli (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√©), Yannis Voisard (Tudor), the Bais brothers, Davide and Mattia (Polti-VisitMalta), Gijs Leemreize (Picnic-PostNL), Felix Engelhardt (Jayco-AIUIa), Jefferson Cepeda (Movistar), Simone Petilli (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers), David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ), Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) and Simon Gugliemi (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels).</p>\n<p>Shortly before the summit of the first climb of the day, the Cat.2 Carbonare, the two groups fused, making for a group of 24 ahead. With Fortunato at 48 minutes down overall as the biggest GC threat, the main peloton was content to let the stage leaders get on with it, and over the summit, after the Italian had darted ahead to gain more points, their advantage had yawned to over six minutes.</p>\n<p>Regrettably, the drop off the Carbonare proved far more consequential than the ascent, as both Rogliƒç and Martinelli fell and crashed out of the race. Martinelli was transported to hospital after skidding spectacularly at speed on a sweeping right-hand bend, fortunately remaining conscious despite falling into a ravine. But Rogliƒç, whose injuries were also unclear, but merely compounded his previous difficulties, had to quit.</p>\n<p>Once past the Candriai, a fearsomely long Cat.1 climb and the third of five main ascents on the day, as yet more riders fell on a course that was proving to be a treacherous skating rink, there was a distinct lull in the GC action. </p>\n<p>The gap between the break and bunch shrank almost of its own volition to just over five minutes on the descent, only to balloon back up to eight on the flat which followed. At the intermediate sprint at Cavendine, Van Bondt and Van Aert briefly went clear just as the sun appeared for the first time in the race, and with a potentially stage-winning margin for the break now emerging for sure, the collaboration became less and less marked amongst the 23 stage leaders.</p>\n<p>Come the second last climb, on the Santa Barbara, the break predictably began to disintegrate, with XDS Astana trying to keep the move under control, Van Aert being amongst those immediately affected. Ineos, however, were the team piling on the pressure the most with Castroviejo, only for EF to add on the heat and shred the GC group yet further.</p>\n<p>The pace proved too much for Ayuso, fading out of contention with around 45 kilometres to go. Riding steadily and rising in and out of the saddle, Ayuso&#8217;s near-isolation as he faced his difficulties was a clear indication that UAE were placing all their bets on Del Toro. In the space of less than 500 metres, he was already 45 seconds behind despite Igor Arrieta finally being ordered back to support him. But the way Ayuso was banging on the handlebars in frustration was an indication of a key moment in the overall battle. </p>\n<p>Finally, he lost nearly 15 minutes on the stage, his GC hopes completely gone. Then when Bernal also fell behind, as Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) upped the pace in person to chase down a move by Michael Storer (Tudor) and Max Poole (Picnic PostNL),  it became even more clear this could be a critical GC day.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the break had shrunk considerably on the Santa Barbara, leaving just seven riders ahead out of the original 23 &#8211; Bilbao, Moniquet, Cepeda, a very active Leemreize, Voisard, Fortunato and Scaroni &#8211; but still enjoying having a 4:30 gap. Finally, on one of the last sections of flat of the stage, Voisard opted to go clear and he reached the foot of the monster San Valentino ascent, the decisive climb of the day, alone with a 20-second margin on the six chasers.</p>\n<p>With only a victory in the Tour of Hungary in his palmares to date, Voisard was clearly determined to go for the biggest win of his career, doubling that advantage before Scaroni began to chase behind. The smooth, steady slopes in the first part of the 18.2 kilometre ascent, though, quickly enabled Cepeda and mountains leader Fortunato to start to close the gap. </p>\n<p>It was 13 kilometres from the summit where the two XDS Astana racers and Cepeda reached the Swiss racer. Scaroni then zipped away alone in pursuit of Italy&#8217;s first stage win. Fortunato dropped Cepeda in turn, too, quickly bridging across to his teammate, and safely keeping a margin of 46 seconds on their sole chaser. </p>\n<p>The two then hung on together all the way to the summit, Scaroni suffering notably in the last metres to keep in contact. But finally Fortunato gestured his teammate round, and after a shake of hands, the two crossed the line with Scaroni just ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>The GC battle</strong><br />\nIn the GC group on the San Valentino, EF piled on the pressure yet again in the pink jersey, but the most notable change of pace came thanks to Van Aert, out of the early break but still providing sterling support for teammate Simon Yates. Meanwhile, Del Toro was already relying mostly on just Rafa≈Ç Majka for support, and the Polish climber and former Tour mountains winner was more than happy to allow a non-GC contender like Giulio Pellizzari (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) to go for his own and clip away from the break. However, the real interest centred on whether Del Toro &#8211; increasingly isolated and with no Ayuso to support him in an 11-man GC group &#8211; could defend his lead.</p>\n<p>Finally, some 8.5 kilometres from the summit, the challenges began to pour in. First, Simon Yates charged away, pulling Del Toro and Carapaz  &#8211; clearly not suffering from an earlier crash &#8211; with him. Shortly afterwards, Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) bridged across. The climb&#8217;s radically uneven slopes seemed to be no problem for Yates, accelerating viciously, briefly out of the saddle time and again, but finally it was Carapaz, about a kilometre later, who stomped his way clear. Critically, there was no reaction from Del Toro.</p>\n<p>Gee forced his way clear, but Del Toro was not pushing so hard, staying with Yates and the two briefly collaborated as they drew up to the Canadian. Finally, with 4.7 kilometres to go, Del Toro simply could not respond to the Briton&#8217;s repeated digs and his head swaying, was forced to let his closest GC pursuer go free. Even when Bernal drew up to his back wheel, there was seemingly nothing he could do.</p>\n<p>Carapaz forged on, meanwhile, and even if he could not catch Pellizzari for the bonus seconds, he sprinted across the line, in fourth, 1:08 down on the victorious XDS Astana duo. Yates crossed the line in eighth place, 1:52 behind, and the wait to see how much damage had been inflicted on Del Toro began.</p>\n<p>Finally, the verdict was that the Mexican had suffered a severe setback, but by no means a complete rout. He crossed the line in 13th place, 2:46 back, enough to retain his overall lead by 26 seconds on Yates. 2019 Giro winner Carapaz, despite his blistering effort on the last ascent, remains in third place, 31 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Three mountain stages remain, and after UAE&#8217;s near-stranglehold on the overall crumbled significantly in just one day of full-on climbing, Del Toro will have a much tougher time holding onto the pink than anyone could have expected 24 hours earlier. The Mexican has been punching above his weight for nearly two weeks now. The big question is &#8211; how much longer can he continue to do so?</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Carlos Verona (Lidl-Trek) secured a 40km solo victory on stage 15 at the Giro d&#8217;Italia, holding off a chase group and crossing the line 22 seconds ahead of<br />\nFlorian Stork (Tudor Pro Cycling) and an additional second ahead of Christian Scaroni (XDS Astana) on the streets of Asiago.</p>\n<p>At 219km in length, the stage marked the second-longest of this year‚Äôs Giro d‚ÄôItalia, and it was Verona who made a decisive move at the foot of the Passo Dori, holding on over the top of the climb and extended his gap on those behind until his lead was unassailable, soloing to the finish to take the second professional victory of his career and a first Grand Tour stage win.</p>\n<p>A veteran of 16 Grand Tours, the 32-year-old Spaniard is a deserving winner, having ridden as a domestique for most of his career. It also adds yet another success for his Lidl-Trek team at this Giro d‚ÄôItalia and a much-needed lift within the team after losing Giulio Ciccone on yesterday‚Äôs stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I certainly didn&#8217;t come to the Giro thinking that I could win a stage, and I was happy with that. I was here in full support for Mads Pedersen and Giulio Ciccone. Everything changed yesterday when we lost Cicco. Today is my day. I didn&#8217;t want to do it for me, but I wanted to do it for the team, knowing how much Giulio had worked for this race,&#8221; Verona said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I was in the breakaway, I thought we were missing one rider, but everything happens for a reason. I had to be in that break. I stayed focused. I had the legs to be there. I had to go from far out, and I had to win for the team.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On a day that saw the general classification riders attacking over the main ascents, mid-race Monte Grappa and late-race Passo Dori, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was dropped on the final climb, as several teams looked to distance him further before the finish. He would lose a minute and a half to maglia rosa Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), dropping him down to tenth in the overall standings.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) attempted to test the legs of Del Toro on both the Monte Grappa and the Passo Dori, but the 19-year-old Mexican marked every move with ease and kept his overall lead intact come the finish.</p>\n<p>There were some issues for his teammate Juan Ayuso on the Monte Grappa though, as after a poorly timed mechanical, the Spanish rider found himself distanced by the likes of Bernal, Carapaz and Del Toro over the top of the climb and was forced to rely on his team to pace him back on the descent.</p>\n<p>Del Toro continues to lead the overall classification by 1:20 ahead of Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and 1:26 ahead of Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), as the race heads into its second rest day on Monday before stage 16&#8217;s mountainous race into San Valentino (Brentonico) on Tuesday.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was a fierce battle for the breakaway at the beginning of the day, as teams fought to get riders up the road in the first part of the stage ahead of the Monte Grappa and Passo Dori later on.</p>\n<p>It took around 62km of racing for a breakaway to eventually form, as a group of 35 riders established itself at the head of the race. They would be allowed an advantage of around three minutes, as UAE Team Emirates-XRG managed the gap in the peloton behind.</p>\n<p>The sheer size of the breakaway inevitably led to some issues with cooperation, as several riders attempted to draw a smaller group clear. However, the front group would come back together on the lower slopes of the Monte Grappa, as Movistar and XDS Astana set the pace.</p>\n<p>It would then begin to fracture at the head of the race, as the climbers came to the fore on the steeper gradients, and several small moves started to go off the front</p>\n<p>In the peloton behind, a small issue for Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) left him off the back with around 8km to go on the climb. His struggles were then compounded as Ineos Grenadiers began to set a hard pace in the main group just as he was beginning to return.</p>\n<p>After all of the work from his team, Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) then launched an attack with 3km to go until the summit, with Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) immediately following, before Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) bridged across.</p>\n<p>Arensman worked hard to extend the gap for Bernal, with Carapaz also keen to capitalise on the opportunity, whilst Del Toro was forced to sit on with Ayuso caught out behind.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the climb, Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) took the maximum points to extend his lead in the maglia azzurra, as the gap to the breakaway fell to around a minute over the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG worked to bring Ayuso back into contention, bridging the gap to the group of Del Toro on the descent.</p>\n<p>In the breakaway, Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech) went clear on the descent as the rest of the group was caught. He had a gap of around 20 seconds as they entered the valley road, before being joined by a chasing group of ten riders that had attacked out of the peloton.</p>\n<p>The newly formed group were given a sizeable advantage by the peloton, as their gap grew quickly.</p>\n<p>As they reached the foot of the Passo Dori, a surprise move from Carlos Verona (Lidl-Trek) was not immediately marked, with Gianmarco Garofoli (Soudal Quick-Step) the only rider to go with the Spanish veteran.</p>\n<p>However, the young Italian could not hold Verona‚Äôs wheel, as he was then joined by Filippo Zana (Jayco AlUla), before the pair were eventually reabsorbed by the remnants of the breakaway.</p>\n<p>There were some attempted moves from the GC contenders on the climb and it was Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) who suffered the most, as he was dropped along with Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) with around 30km to go.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian rapidly lost time in the final 2km of the climb and would concede a minute and a half to his rivals at the finish, as all of the teams in the peloton worked to distance him as much as possible.</p>\n<p>After reaching the summit of the final climb, Verona began to extend his gap on the chasers behind him on the undulating plateau to the finish. With a gap of around 40 seconds as he entered the final 5km of the stage, he began the final descent into Asiago with the stage win well within his grasp.</p>\n<p>Verona crossed the line to take an incredible victory, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the remnants of the breakaway led by Florian Stork (Tudor Pro Cycling), whilst the maglia rosa group arrived a few seconds later.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=15&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=15&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) came home two minutes down to lose 1:44 to the lead group, while Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) lost minutes after resuming from the crash over six minutes down.</p>\n<p>The new GC picture sees Del Toro holding pink by an extended 1:20 from Simon Yates, while Ayuso lies third at 1:26. Rogliƒç remains fifth, now at 2:23 down rather than 1:35, while Tiberi drops five places to eighth at 3:02.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the mountainous final week of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia looming, only a handful of chances remained for the sprinters of the peloton, with stage 14&#8217;s trip to the Slovenian border providing another opportunity.</p>\n<p>The largely flat stage, featuring just under 1,000 metres of climbing, headed 195km east from Treviso to the cross-border city of Nova Gorica-Gorizia. Just three fourth-category climbs lay in wait for the peloton, with Goniace (3.5km at 4.9%) and two ascents of Saver (700m at 7.7%) coming in the final 40km of the stage.</p>\n<p>The break of the day took some time to go clear as attacks flew from the start. The first 20km of the stage saw a strong group jump away, including Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike), Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost), Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Josef Cerny (Soudal-QuickStep), and Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>That breakaway attempt wouldn‚Äôt succeed, however, but Asgreen continued to push alone at the front. He drew a sole chaser in Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta), before Cl√©ment Davy (Groupama-FDJ), Louis Meintjes (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) also came across.</p>\n<p>Attacks continued behind, but as Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck set about taking control of the peloton with 160km to go, that quintet was set as the break of the day. They‚Äôd take 90 seconds on the main group, but Meintjes only lasted 10km with the leaders before dropping back.</p>\n<p>On the pan-flat run to the border, rain showers came and went and then came back again, though little else of note occurred as the riders raced eastwards. Maestri led over the first intermediate sprint at Morsano al Tagliamento before Marcellusi beat him to the line at Talmassons, 94km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Both sprints saw De Bondt jump out of the peloton to sprint against maglia ciclamino Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), an odd matchup given the Belgian lay seventh in the standings, 178 points down on the Dane. He took the singular point on offer on each occasion, in any case.</p>\n<p>At the next sprint, the Red Bull Kilometre at 62km to go, the break race on with an 80-second lead while Maestri led the way once again as Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck continued at the head of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Throngs of Slovenian fans, out in force to support their hero Rogliƒç, greeted the Giro at the border, where the riders finally hit the first climb of the day at Gonlace, 42km from the line.</p>\n<p>The break soon became a trio on the way up as Davy dropped off the back. Asgreen led them over the top while back in the peloton, Ineos Grenadiers accelerated to the front, bringing the gap down to a minute.</p>\n<p>On the city circuit, a tightening bend at 23km to go brought the first major drama of the day as the squeeze in the peloton brought on a multi-rider crash and a split in the group. Lidl-Trek GC leader Giulio Ciccone went down hard and took some time to get going again, resuming six minutes off the lead.</p>\n<p>The split also saw a swathe of other GC riders ‚Äì including Rogliƒç, Ayuso, Bernal, and Tiberi ‚Äì on the back foot, forced to chase a lead peloton which included race leader Del plus Carapaz, Simon Yates, and Gee.</p>\n<p>Out front, the break was hanging on to a 25-second lead heading into the final 10km. Rogliƒç, Ayuso, Bernal and his teammate Arensman lay 1:10 down, while Tiberi and several teammates chased from a two-minute deficit.</p>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of Visma-Lease a Bike chasing the break for their sprinter Kooij, it would be the break which fought for the victory ‚Äì or one of their number, at least. Asgreen, the sole WorldTour representative in the move, went for it on the day‚Äôs final climb with 6.5km to go.</p>\n<p>He held onto an ever-tightening gap during the closing kilometres. However, it was an advantage which hovered around the 10 to 15-second mark rather than melting into single figures.</p>\n<p>The Dane, a winner from the break at the Tour de France two years ago, held on to hold off the select chase group and record the 14th victory of his career, EF‚Äôs second in four days at the Giro.</p>\n<p>16 seconds later, the fastmen Groves, Kooij, and Orluis Aular (Movistar) led home the chase, while, further back, a swathe of major Giro contenders were left counting their losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost) hung on for a famous breakaway victory on stage 14 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, the Dane‚Äôs triumph coming on a day of unexpected GC drama thanks to a crash on the closing circuit.</p>\n<p>As the race visited the Italy-Slovenia cross-border city of Gorizia-Nova Gorica, what was expected to be a straightforward sprint stage was turned on its head by a multi-rider crash in the peloton 23km from the line.</p>\n<p>GC contenders Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers), Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), and Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) were all caught out in the fall, shedding major time at the end of the 195km stage.</p>\n<p>Out front, Asgreen took advantage of the split in the peloton and resulting chaos to go solo 6.5km from the line.</p>\n<p>He left behind breakaway survivors Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) to solo home and win the stage by 16 seconds as Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease A Bike) led a 16-rider peloton across the line.</p>\n<p>Maglia rosa Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was safe among the lead group, as were other major GC names Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost), Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike), Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious), and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>The next group on the road, at 1:04 down on Asgreen and those losing 48 seconds to Del Toro et al, were Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), the Ineos Grenadiers duo of Egan Bernal and Thymen Arensman, and Michael Storer (Tudor).</p>\n<p>It was an even worse day for Italy‚Äôs top GC hopefuls. Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) came home two minutes down to lose 1:44 to the lead group, while Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) lost minutes after resuming from the crash over six minutes down.</p>\n<p>The new GC picture sees Del Toro holding pink by an extended 1:20 from Simon Yates, while Ayuso lies third at 1:26. Rogliƒç remains fifth, now at 2:23 down rather than 1:35, while Tiberi drops five places to eighth at 3:02.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the mountainous final week of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia looming, only a handful of chances remained for the sprinters of the peloton, with stage 14&#8217;s trip to the Slovenian border providing another opportunity.</p>\n<p>The largely flat stage, featuring just under 1,000 metres of climbing, headed 195km east from Treviso to the cross-border city of Nova Gorica-Gorizia. Just three fourth-category climbs lay in wait for the peloton, with Goniace (3.5km at 4.9%) and two ascents of Saver (700m at 7.7%) coming in the final 40km of the stage.</p>\n<p>The break of the day took some time to go clear as attacks flew from the start. The first 20km of the stage saw a strong group jump away, including Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike), Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Kasper Asgreen (EF Education-EasyPost), Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Josef Cerny (Soudal-QuickStep), and Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>That breakaway attempt wouldn‚Äôt succeed, however, but Asgreen continued to push alone at the front. He drew a sole chaser in Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta), before Cl√©ment Davy (Groupama-FDJ), Louis Meintjes (Intermarch√©-Wanty), and Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) also came across.</p>\n<p>Attacks continued behind, but as Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck set about taking control of the peloton with 160km to go, that quintet was set as the break of the day. They‚Äôd take 90 seconds on the main group, but Meintjes only lasted 10km with the leaders before dropping back.</p>\n<p>On the pan-flat run to the border, rain showers came and went and then came back again, though little else of note occurred as the riders raced eastwards. Maestri led over the first intermediate sprint at Morsano al Tagliamento before Marcellusi beat him to the line at Talmassons, 94km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Both sprints saw De Bondt jump out of the peloton to sprint against maglia ciclamino Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), an odd matchup given the Belgian lay seventh in the standings, 178 points down on the Dane. He took the singular point on offer on each occasion, in any case.</p>\n<p>At the next sprint, the Red Bull Kilometre at 62km to go, the break race on with an 80-second lead while Maestri led the way once again as Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck continued at the head of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Throngs of Slovenian fans, out in force to support their hero Rogliƒç, greeted the Giro at the border, where the riders finally hit the first climb of the day at Gonlace, 42km from the line.</p>\n<p>The break soon became a trio on the way up as Davy dropped off the back. Asgreen led them over the top while back in the peloton, Ineos Grenadiers accelerated to the front, bringing the gap down to a minute.</p>\n<p>On the city circuit, a tightening bend at 23km to go brought the first major drama of the day as the squeeze in the peloton brought on a multi-rider crash and a split in the group. Lidl-Trek GC leader Giulio Ciccone went down hard and took some time to get going again, resuming six minutes off the lead.</p>\n<p>The split also saw a swathe of other GC riders ‚Äì including Rogliƒç, Ayuso, Bernal, and Tiberi ‚Äì on the back foot, forced to chase a lead peloton which included race leader Del plus Carapaz, Simon Yates, and Gee.</p>\n<p>Out front, the break was hanging on to a 25-second lead heading into the final 10km. Rogliƒç, Ayuso, Bernal and his teammate Arensman lay 1:10 down, while Tiberi and several teammates chased from a two-minute deficit.</p>\n<p>Despite the best efforts of Visma-Lease a Bike chasing the break for their sprinter Kooij, it would be the break which fought for the victory ‚Äì or one of their number, at least. Asgreen, the sole WorldTour representative in the move, went for it on the day‚Äôs final climb with 6.5km to go.</p>\n<p>He held onto an ever-tightening gap during the closing kilometres. However, it was an advantage which hovered around the 10 to 15-second mark rather than melting into single figures.</p>\n<p>The Dane, a winner from the break at the Tour de France two years ago, held on to hold off the select chase group and record the 14th victory of his career, EF‚Äôs second in four days at the Giro.</p>\n<p>16 seconds later, the fastmen Groves, Kooij, and Orluis Aular (Movistar) led home the chase, while, further back, a swathe of major Giro contenders were left counting their losses.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In addition to the four-second bonus for the stage finish, he also claimed a two-second bonus in the intermediate sprint, stretching his advantage in the GC standings even further.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with this one and adding 50 points to the ciclamino jersey. I&#8217;m overwhelmed about winning again &#8211; it&#8217;s one insane Grand Tour,&#8221; Pedersen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had to open up on the right side, close to the barrier, so I went a bit earlier than I really wanted to, but on such a hard day and an uphill final like this, it&#8217;s sometimes it&#8217;s OK to go early, because everyone have burning legs the last 100 meters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pedersen&#8217;s team put him in a perfect position with Mathias Vacek attacking over the top of the final climb with Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL). The pair were caught inside the final kilometre, but Pedersen was hoping his teammate could hang on and take the win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He deserved it so much &#8211; if there would have been a little bit more hesitation in the in the peloton, he and Bardet would have had 25-30 seconds, and then I&#8217;m pretty sure they would have made it to the finish line.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So this was ideal &#8211; he got the chance of winning the stage, and then we could sit behind and let all the teams keep a really high speed. So it was an ideal situation for us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Del Toro had a moment where he thought he might be able to win the stage after following Alpecin&#8217;s Edward Planckaert to the front on the climb but he faded quickly once Pedersen came flying past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have the sprint in the legs. I just feel worse and worse. And then Mads Pedersen comes super fast and Wout van Aert follows, and I tried to follow, but I didn&#8217;t have the legs to stay in the wheel even, it was a super strong finish. And yeah, chapeau &#8211; I did my best.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He leads the Giro d&#8217;Italia by 38 seconds over teammate Juan Ayuso after taking the time bonuses, with Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) still in third at 1:18.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere was an aggressive start out of the neutral zone in Rovigo, with lots of teams interested in trying to make a breakaway on stage 13 of the Giro d&#8217;Italia. With 180km on the menu and some open, exposed roads, the threat of wind had everyone on edge.</p>\n<p>Several teams tried their luck, but Visma-Lease a Bike and Lidl-Trek made their intentions for the day clear, ensuring a group that wasn&#8217;t too big got away.</p>\n<p>Splits formed at points, and the peloton was lined out single file, as the wind blew hard into the peloton. Sven Erik Bystr√∏m (Groupama-FDJ) was the first rider who really got any separation, and the break of the day was formed when eight riders bridged across to his wheel.</p>\n<p>What looked like it could have been a crazy start was calmed down, with those in the peloton wanting the victory allowing the nine men to get away: Bystr√∏m, Lorenzo Germani (Groupama-FDJ), Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar), Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL), Mattia Bais (Polti VisitMalta), Filippo Magli (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®), Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Fran Miholjeviƒá (Bahrain Victorious) and Luca Mozzato (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels).</p>\n<p>A normal pattern of a breakaway wouldn&#8217;t follow, however, with Lidl-Trek, Visma and Q36.5 all putting a rider on the front to ensure the nine-rider move didn&#8217;t get much of an advantage to play with on the road to Vincenza.</p>\n<p>With Pedersen, Van Aert and Pidcock among their ranks, all three had one of the favourites of the day to work for.</p>\n<p>The average speed was rapid throughout the opening 100km of the stage, with the work behind keeping the break&#8217;s advantage under the three-minute mark for the entire time. Such was the pace behind that with 55km and only the circuits around the finish remaining, their lead was down to less than one minute.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final 50 kilometres, Ineos Grenadiers applied pressure as the breakaway&#8217;s gap fell under 30 seconds, and while maglia rosa Isaac del Toro was attentive and up front, his UAE Team Emirates-XRG teammate Juan Ayuso was left to close down a gap on his own.</p>\n<p>Germani attacked and left his breakaway companions behind, but it was an act of desperation as the peloton was bearing down on the escapees.</p>\n<p>Ben Turner set such a wicked pace on the lower slopes of the San Giovanni in Monte climb that even Ineos teammate Thymen Arensman struggled to stay on. The effort shredded the peloton into bits, but Del Toro was there all the while.</p>\n<p>An attack from Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) followed, and Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) bridged across but they weren&#8217;t able to stay clear. The pace slowed, and riders like Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) made it back into the lead chase.</p>\n<p>Germani was the only breakaway rider left at the summit of the San Giovanni in Monte climb and, with a steep, technical descent, the Giro d&#8217;Italia contenders fought to hold a good position.</p>\n<p>Just before the top, Christian Scaroni (XDS Astana) bridged across to Germani and led over the summit, helping to breathe new life into the breakaway.</p>\n<p>The duo built up a lead of almost one minute with 25km to go, but the chase behind was on at such a furious pace, that the maglia rosa nearly came down in a sharp turn but managed to stay up.</p>\n<p>With the Red Bull KM time bonus sprint coming on a climb with 10.4km to go, UAE Team Emirates chased down the breakaway, catching Germani before the sprint line.</p>\n<p>Scaroni stayed clear to take the six-second bonus, but Del Toro let Ayuso win the sprint for second. That let Ayuso carve two seconds out of the maglia rosa&#8217;s advantage but the pair gained time on everyone else.</p>\n<p>Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL) attacked after the sprint and was quickly joined by Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek). The duo powered out a 17-second lead with 4km to go, and with points leader Pedersen absolved of putting the team behind a chase, that work fell exclusively to Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck.</p>\n<p>The two leaders had only 10 seconds with 2km to go, but with only eight seconds as they passed under the 1km banner, the catch was certain.

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>An expected day for the breakaway on stage 11 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia instead brought a minor GC skirmish on the final climb of Pietra di Bismantova, as Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) staged a 9km solo raid to take his fourth career Giro stage victory.</p>\n<p>The Ecuadorian sped past the day‚Äôs breakaway on the final second-category climb of the challenging mid-mountain stage to little reaction from the remainder of the GC group. He pushed on alone over the top and the remaining 5km to win and move up in the standings.</p>\n<p>Carapaz crossed the line in Castelnovo ne‚Äô Monti 10 seconds ahead of the chasing group, which was led home by maglia rosa Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) ahead of Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) to celebrate the 24th win of his career.</p>\n<p>Del Toro spent the day secure in the pink jersey, only adding to his race lead at the finish after coming off Tom Pidcock‚Äôs (Q36.5) wheel and leading the GC group around the final corner.</p>\n<p>The Mexican led home a group of 17 GC contenders, with Ciccone, Pidcock, and Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) on his wheel, while teammate Juan Ayuso and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) finished further back in seventh and 12th.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a very difficult stage. On the first climb, so many riders were suffering, and then I knew I had great legs. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the moment to attack,&#8221; Carapaz said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose the right moment, and luckily I was able to hold on until the finish. It was almost a time trial until the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to dedicate the victory to my son, who is celebrating his birthday, and my wife. I hope they enjoyed what I did today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt plan on taking it easy, I‚Äôm going to keep fighting until the end of the Giro.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With 10 seconds added to his 10-second time bonus, 2019 Giro champion Carapaz now moves up from his previous ninth place to sixth on the general classification, 1:56 off Del Toro.</p>\n<p>The race leader heads into stage 12 with an extended 31-second lead over Ayuso, while Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) lies in third at 1:07. Rogliƒç, 1:24 down, has 32 seconds over the resurgent Carapaz.</p>\n<p>Despite the breakaway not contesting the finish, having been caught 9km from the line, stage 11 was a big day for maglia azzurra Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), who added 58 points to his mountain classification total to end the day with a huge lead on 156 points.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 11 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia was one suited to the breakaway battlers with 3,800 metres of elevation lying between the riders setting out from Viareggio, Tuscany and the finish in Castelnovo ne‚Äô Monti, Reggio Emilia.</p>\n<p>Following a largely flat start to the 186km stage, the Alpe San Pellegrino (13.7km at 8.8%) would provide the toughest test of the day, though at 92km from the finish, the first-category climb wouldn‚Äôt be decisive.</p>\n<p>Instead, the later climbs of Toano (11.1km at 4.9%), 39km from the line, and Pietra di Bismantova (5.8km at 5.8%), 5km out, would have a greater effect on the stage‚Äôs final result.</p>\n<p>It took some time for the break of the day to get established at the front, with attacks flowing out of the peloton on the flat roads of the opening 70km.</p>\n<p>Riders including Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep), Yanis Voisard (Tudor), Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), and Jimmy Janssens (Alpecin-Deceuninck) made moves in the opening 40km. A two-man attack from Xabier Azparren (Q36.5) and Steven Kruijswijk (Visma-Lease a Bike) led over the intermediate sprint at Borgo a Mozzano after 46km.</p>\n<p>It all came back together shortly afterwards, however, though more attacks came 60km in, on the hill at Barga (3.6km at 5.9%) on the approach to Alpe San Pellegrino. Wout Poels (XDS-Astana) led the moves, while his teammate, mountain classification leader Lorenzo Fortunato, was part of a larger group coming up behind.</p>\n<p>Wilco Kelderman (Visma-Lease A Bike) joined Poels at the front going over Barga, while over 20 riders closed in just behind. The groups would merge in time for Alpe San Pellegrino, hitting the start of the climb at 1:40 up on the peloton.</p>\n<p>Among the riders coming across were Lidl-Trek duo Mads Pedersen and Mathias Vacek, Visma-Lease a Bike pairing Steven Kruijswijik and Bart Lemmen, plus Jan Tratnik (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Nairo Quintana (Movistar), Davide Piganzoli (Polti-VisitMalta), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), James Knox (Soudal-QuickStep), Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), and Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n<p>The group didn‚Äôt stick together for long as Fortunato took off at the front 11km from the top of the climb in search of another 40 mountain points. As UAE Team Emirates-XRG pulled in the peloton behind, Fortunato, racing two hours from his hometown of Bologna, pulled out a 30-second lead over the remainder of the break.</p>\n<p>Five kilometres from the top, 97km from the finish, a move from Plapp provoked further splits in the break as Quintana, Poels, and Bilbao joined him to make it four chasing Fortunato.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back in the peloton, Ineos Grenadiers were cooking up something. At 95km to go, Egan Bernal made a move off the front, the Colombian champion swiftly marked by UAE duo Isaac Del Toro and Juan Ayuso.</p>\n<p>The acceleration saw both Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and his brother Adam (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) among the notable names dropping from the GC group. Rogliƒç looked less than comfortable a day on from his time trial recon crash, too.</p>\n<p>All were back on for the descent, however, with the GC group now slimmed down to around 20 riders a minute behind Fortunato, who added 40 points to his previous total of 98 as he led the race across the summit.</p>\n<p>A long descent followed, with 42km standing between the riders and Cerredolo, which hosted the day‚Äôs second intermediate sprint and the start of the climb of Toano.</p>\n<p>Partway down, 81km from the finish, Fortunato was caught by the chasing quartet to make it five out front. Back in the GC group, now almost two minutes down, UAE ‚Äì with all eight men on the front ‚Äì continued to control as dropped riders made their way back on.</p>\n<p>At Cerredolo, the leading quintet lay 2:15 up on the now-enlarged peloton, with Fortunato leading the group across the intermediate sprint with 50km to run before they began the Toano ascent.</p>\n<p>UAE and the peloton were in no rush to get to the top, leaving the break to ride up the climb gaining time as they went. At the top, where Fortunato took 18 points to take his total to 156, the group lay 2:50 down.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the climb, maglia ciclamino Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) took over the pacemaking from UAE, cutting 90 seconds from the time gap before the race hit the Red Bull Kilometre at Villa Minozzo, 24km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Quintana led the way over the sprint, 1:20 up on the peloton with a short descent and 6km in the valley lying ahead of Pietra di Bismantova and the final run to the line. Another 45 seconds had melted away at the start of the climb with 10km to go.</p>\n<p>The break battled on up the day‚Äôs final climb, but their time out front was numbered as the peloton closed in and made the catch 9km out. Carapaz attacked past them on the way up, with maglia rosa Del Toro and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) leading the chase 10 seconds back.</p>\n<p>With few behind interested in the chase, Carapaz pulled out a 30-second gap by the top of the climb.

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>An expected day for the breakaway on stage 11 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia instead brought a minor GC skirmish on the final climb of Pietra di Bismantova, as Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) staged a 9km solo raid to take his fourth career Giro stage victory.</p>\n<p>The Ecuadorian sped past the day‚Äôs breakaway on the final second-category climb of the challenging mid-mountain stage to little reaction from the remainder of the GC group. He pushed on alone over the top and the remaining 5km to win and move up in the standings.</p>\n<p>Carapaz crossed the line in Castelnovo ne‚Äô Monti 10 seconds ahead of the chasing group, which was led home by maglia rosa Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) ahead of Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) to celebrate the 24th win of his career.</p>\n<p>Del Toro spent the day secure in the pink jersey, only adding to his race lead at the finish after coming off Tom Pidcock‚Äôs (Q36.5) wheel and leading the GC group around the final corner.</p>\n<p>The Mexican led home a group of 17 GC contenders, with Ciccone, Pidcock, and Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) on his wheel, while teammate Juan Ayuso and Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) finished further back in seventh and 12th.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a very difficult stage. On the first climb, so many riders were suffering, and then I knew I had great legs. Then it was just a matter of waiting for the moment to attack,&#8221; Carapaz said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose the right moment, and luckily I was able to hold on until the finish. It was almost a time trial until the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to dedicate the victory to my son, who is celebrating his birthday, and my wife. I hope they enjoyed what I did today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don‚Äôt plan on taking it easy, I‚Äôm going to keep fighting until the end of the Giro.&#8221;</p>\n<p>With 10 seconds added to his 10-second time bonus, 2019 Giro champion Carapaz now moves up from his previous ninth place to sixth on the general classification, 1:56 off Del Toro.</p>\n<p>The race leader heads into stage 12 with an extended 31-second lead over Ayuso, while Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) lies in third at 1:07. Rogliƒç, 1:24 down, has 32 seconds over the resurgent Carapaz.</p>\n<p>Despite the breakaway not contesting the finish, having been caught 9km from the line, stage 11 was a big day for maglia azzurra Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), who added 58 points to his mountain classification total to end the day with a huge lead on 156 points.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 11 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia was one suited to the breakaway battlers with 3,800 metres of elevation lying between the riders setting out from Viareggio, Tuscany and the finish in Castelnovo ne‚Äô Monti, Reggio Emilia.</p>\n<p>Following a largely flat start to the 186km stage, the Alpe San Pellegrino (13.7km at 8.8%) would provide the toughest test of the day, though at 92km from the finish, the first-category climb wouldn‚Äôt be decisive.</p>\n<p>Instead, the later climbs of Toano (11.1km at 4.9%), 39km from the line, and Pietra di Bismantova (5.8km at 5.8%), 5km out, would have a greater effect on the stage‚Äôs final result.</p>\n<p>It took some time for the break of the day to get established at the front, with attacks flowing out of the peloton on the flat roads of the opening 70km.</p>\n<p>Riders including Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep), Yanis Voisard (Tudor), Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), and Jimmy Janssens (Alpecin-Deceuninck) made moves in the opening 40km. A two-man attack from Xabier Azparren (Q36.5) and Steven Kruijswijk (Visma-Lease a Bike) led over the intermediate sprint at Borgo a Mozzano after 46km.</p>\n<p>It all came back together shortly afterwards, however, though more attacks came 60km in, on the hill at Barga (3.6km at 5.9%) on the approach to Alpe San Pellegrino. Wout Poels (XDS-Astana) led the moves, while his teammate, mountain classification leader Lorenzo Fortunato, was part of a larger group coming up behind.</p>\n<p>Wilco Kelderman (Visma-Lease A Bike) joined Poels at the front going over Barga, while over 20 riders closed in just behind. The groups would merge in time for Alpe San Pellegrino, hitting the start of the climb at 1:40 up on the peloton.</p>\n<p>Among the riders coming across were Lidl-Trek duo Mads Pedersen and Mathias Vacek, Visma-Lease a Bike pairing Steven Kruijswijik and Bart Lemmen, plus Jan Tratnik (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Nairo Quintana (Movistar), Davide Piganzoli (Polti-VisitMalta), Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious), James Knox (Soudal-QuickStep), Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), and Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n<p>The group didn‚Äôt stick together for long as Fortunato took off at the front 11km from the top of the climb in search of another 40 mountain points. As UAE Team Emirates-XRG pulled in the peloton behind, Fortunato, racing two hours from his hometown of Bologna, pulled out a 30-second lead over the remainder of the break.</p>\n<p>Five kilometres from the top, 97km from the finish, a move from Plapp provoked further splits in the break as Quintana, Poels, and Bilbao joined him to make it four chasing Fortunato.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, back in the peloton, Ineos Grenadiers were cooking up something. At 95km to go, Egan Bernal made a move off the front, the Colombian champion swiftly marked by UAE duo Isaac Del Toro and Juan Ayuso.</p>\n<p>The acceleration saw both Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike) and his brother Adam (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) among the notable names dropping from the GC group. Rogliƒç looked less than comfortable a day on from his time trial recon crash, too.</p>\n<p>All were back on for the descent, however, with the GC group now slimmed down to around 20 riders a minute behind Fortunato, who added 40 points to his previous total of 98 as he led the race across the summit.</p>\n<p>A long descent followed, with 42km standing between the riders and Cerredolo, which hosted the day‚Äôs second intermediate sprint and the start of the climb of Toano.</p>\n<p>Partway down, 81km from the finish, Fortunato was caught by the chasing quartet to make it five out front. Back in the GC group, now almost two minutes down, UAE ‚Äì with all eight men on the front ‚Äì continued to control as dropped riders made their way back on.</p>\n<p>At Cerredolo, the leading quintet lay 2:15 up on the now-enlarged peloton, with Fortunato leading the group across the intermediate sprint with 50km to run before they began the Toano ascent.</p>\n<p>UAE and the peloton were in no rush to get to the top, leaving the break to ride up the climb gaining time as they went. At the top, where Fortunato took 18 points to take his total to 156, the group lay 2:50 down.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the climb, maglia ciclamino Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) took over the pacemaking from UAE, cutting 90 seconds from the time gap before the race hit the Red Bull Kilometre at Villa Minozzo, 24km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Quintana led the way over the sprint, 1:20 up on the peloton with a short descent and 6km in the valley lying ahead of Pietra di Bismantova and the final run to the line. Another 45 seconds had melted away at the start of the climb with 10km to go.</p>\n<p>The break battled on up the day‚Äôs final climb, but their time out front was numbered as the peloton closed in and made the catch 9km out. Carapaz attacked past them on the way up, with maglia rosa Del Toro and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) leading the chase 10 seconds back.</p>\n<p>With few behind interested in the chase, Carapaz pulled out a 30-second gap by the top of the climb. UAE settled into the lead of the group without much concern for Carapaz. After all, the 10-second time bonus taken by Carapaz meant that they were in no danger of ceding that time to fast finisher Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>The Ecuadorian duly held on to take the stage win, celebrating as he rolled home with some solid time in the bag. Del Toro pushed to the front to lead home the chase group, adding a valuable six seconds to his lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=11&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=11&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Daan Hoole stormed to Lidl-Trek‚Äôs fourth victory of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia, upsetting the odds to beat overwhelming time trial favourite Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) to win stage 10 in Pisa.</p>\n<p>The Dutch champion completed his ride within the first hour of the time trial, beating previous hot seat occupier Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep) by 10 seconds to set a time of 32:30 with an average speed of 52.8kph.</p>\n<p>Tarling, who set off two minutes after Hoole finished his ride, was quickest at the first checkpoint in Pontetto but faded as his ride went on. He shed 24 seconds to Hoole after the first checkpoint and eventually crossed the line seven seconds down to surprisingly miss out on the win.</p>\n<p>Tarling‚Äôs time of 32:37 put him three seconds up on Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep), who finished five minutes later, leaving the two Britons to fill out the podium behind Hoole.</p>\n<p>Italian riders Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) and Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease A Bike) rounded out the top five with times of 32:53 and 32:54, with the quintet the only riders to break the 33-minute barrier on the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t sink in yet, I cannot believe it. I&#8217;m full of emotions, and I want to thank so many people. It&#8217;s crazy,&#8221; Hoole said after his stage win, the second victory of his career and first at WorldTour level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was aiming for this day. I was feeling good all week, but to win, I never thought about it. The GC guys had rain, which changed a lot, but I&#8217;m still happy I could beat Tarling in the same conditions. It&#8217;s an insane feeling,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;[Tarling is] one of the best time triallists in the world. I think he started super fast, and when I saw his first intermediate time, I was thinking it would be hard to beat. I did a good second part and took some time back. Maybe he exploded a little bit. It&#8217;s crazy, I cannot understand it yet. Victory in the Giro is so special. I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Late rainfall around Pisa meant that the GC contenders, starting some two hours later than the podium trio, had no chance of realistically challenging for the stage victory. With the rain starting to fall during Primo≈æ Rogliƒç‚Äôs (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) ride and getting heavier as time progressed, it meant that only the final seven or eight riders had to deal with the very worst conditions.</p>\n<p>Despite the downfall, maglia rosa Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) came home with a time of 34:52, 2:22 off Hoole in 37th place, to defend his race lead. The 21-year-old Mexican held off his teammate Juan Ayuso, defending his 1:13 race lead as the Spaniard put 48 seconds into him to finish in 22nd with a time of 34:04.</p>\n<p>The pair ceded time to Rogliƒç, who had recovered from his spill in the pre-stage recon. The Slovenian, who benefited from racing in slightly drier conditions 25 minutes before the UAE pair, came home with a time of 33:45 for 17th place, making up a potentially valuable 19 seconds on his main pink jersey rival Ayuso.</p>\n<p>The new general classification sees Del Toro lead Ayuso by 25 seconds, with Rogliƒç now in fifth place at 1:18.</p>\n<p>Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) set a strong time of 34:23 for 26th to keep his podium battle alive. The Italian now lies 1:01 off the race lead in third overall, while Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike) is fourth overall after racing to 23rd place with a time of 34:13.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Giro d‚ÄôItalia kicked back into action on Tuesday following the second rest day with the second time trial of the race, a 28.6km time trial between the Tuscan cities of Lucca and Pisa.</p>\n<p>One small hill, at Foro di San Giuliano, marked the midpoint of the largely flat route, while two checkpoints lay in Pontetto at 8.3km and Asciano at 20.5km. Following stage 7&#8217;s summit finish at Tagliacozzo and Sunday‚Äôs trip over the strade bianche on stage 9, the day would bring another GC showdown.</p>\n<p>With riders heading out in reverse GC order, however, there‚Äôd be a three-hour wait for the maglia rosa contenders to start their rides. Instead, Michael Hepburn (Jayco-AlUla) set the quickest early time, topping the timesheets with times of 10:24, 24:04, and, at the finish, 33:20.</p>\n<p>Hepburn, the ninth man off, was beaten by the 22nd, Ethan Hayter as the Briton set a finishing time of 32:40. Shortly afterwards, time trial specialists Josef Cerny (Soudal-QuickStep) and Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease A Bike) came and went with times of 33:54 and 32:54 respectively.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until Daan Hoole set off as the 43rd rider that Hayter‚Äôs time would be beaten. The Dutch champion, second at the first checkpoint, improved as his ride went on, going quickest at the second checkpoint before finishing with a time of 32:30 to take over the hot seat.</p>\n<p>Several big hitters began their rides after an hour of racing, with Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Josh Tarling all setting off in swift succession.</p>\n<p>Plapp (10:08) and Van Aert (10:09) were both quick at the first checkpoint, but Tarling was far quicker, hitting the first checkpoint in a time of 9:49. He shed four seconds to Hoole over the hill at the second checkpoint, but was still on course to beat Plapp (33:14) and a slowing Van Aert (33:39) at the finish.</p>\n<p>He wouldn‚Äôt beat Hoole, however, instead losing three more seconds on the run into Pisa to cross the line in second place with a time of 32:37. A minute later, Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) came home in fifth in 33:07, a time which might have been even better but for an early bike change.</p>\n<p>What followed that flurry of stage contenders was a period of quiet as various domestiques and no-hopers completed their runs before the GC men got underway in the final hour. After Tarling and Vine, the wait for another rider to crack the top 10 would last almost an hour as 56 riders completed their rides.</p>\n<p>Italian pair Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech) and Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) were the next men to make the top 10, setting times of 33:17 and 32:53, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>The GC battle</strong><br />\nThe top 20 GC riders would be along shortly afterwards, with Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL) and Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) both putting in solid runs with times of 33:34 and 33:30 to place themselves just outside the top 10 places.</p>\n<p>Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek), meanwhile, flew at the start of his ride, going second at the first checkpoint. The rain started falling in Pisa shortly afterwards, however, meaning that none of the late riders would trouble the very top of the timesheets.</p>\n<p>Vacek decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the risk and backed off, while the remainder of the GC men were noticeably slower in the latter kilometres, leaving Hoole ever more comfortable in the hot seat.</p>\n<p>All eyes were on Primo≈æ Rogliƒç after his crash in the recon earlier in the day. The Slovenian, who missed out on stage 2 victory by a second, was 20th at the first checkpoint and 18th at the second before crossing the line in 17th place with a time of 33:45.</p>\n<p>His time was better than most of the GC men, with nobody else really troubling it before his main rival Juan Ayuso set off second last. Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) on 33:58, Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious) on 34:24, and Simon Yates on 34:13 all put in solid rides, however.</p>\n<p>Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) was one of the unlucky few to crash during his ride, the Colombian champion falling before the first checkpoint and coming home down in 64th place, 2:58 off Hoole.</p>\n<p>Antonio Tiberi started off the final trio with a solid ride, the third-best of the top 10 on GC. His time of 34:23 kept him third overall at the end of the day. Ayuso was off next, recording 33rd at the first checkpoint, eight seconds down on Rogliƒç, before improving over the mid-section of the stage to go 12 seconds up on the Slovenian.</p>\n<p>The heavy rain at the finish, however, put paid to his hopes of gaining more time on the 35-year-old, with the slowed run-in to Pisa seeing him shed 31 seconds between the second checkpoint and the finish line.</p>\n<p>Del Toro, last off, was out to fight for his pink jersey, and he managed it. He lost 26 seconds to Ayuso at the first checkpoint and was 43 seconds down at the second.</p>\n<p>The rain equalised their times over the final section, though, with Del Toro only shedding a further five seconds into Pisa and thus hanging on to the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=10&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) clapped his doubters about the ears with an emphatic victory on stage 9 of the Giro d&#8217;Italia, out-sprinting Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates XRG) into the Piazza del Campo in Siena.</p>\n<p>The duo were part of a group that bridged to the breakaway on the second sector of gravel on the 181km stage, and, after leaving attacker Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) behind, gained enough time to put Del Toro into the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) won the sprint from the chasing group, 58 seconds behind Van Aert, with Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost), Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike), Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG), Bernal and Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates XRG) rounding out the top 10 on the stage.</p>\n<p>The stage was a minor disaster for Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who was caught up in a crash on the second sector and finished 2:22 behind the stage winner.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s victory was Van Aert&#8217;s first since injuring his knee in the Vuelta a Espa√±a last year, and the result makes up for months of criticism from the Belgian media after his winless spring.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This victory means a lot to me. I almost cannot explain it,&#8221; Van Aert said. &#8220;It had to be here, I believe, because this place is where my road career started back in 2018. To win this stage after a long period without delivering, finally again, it feels so good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van Aert apologised for not working with Del Toro throughout the final kilometres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have to say [Del Toro] did such an amazing ride. I felt a bit shit to not pull too much with him, because obviously he&#8217;s also a competitor for my teammate, Simon Yates, and had to leave the work to him. But still, it was so close to beat him. I had to fight all the way to the top, to the streets of Siena. I know the final pretty well, I needed to do the move in the last three corners.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking after the race, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç took a somewhat more philosophical view of the day&#8217;s events. &#8220;We will see at the end what it means &#8211; today we lose this minute &#8211; sometimes you lose, sometimes you win,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still a long way &#8211; first I need to check the wounds, try to recover and see how to approach it for the next ones,&#8221; Rogliƒç added.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Giro d&#8217;Italia peloton was reduced to 172 riders with the abandon of Koen Bouwman (Jayco-AlUla) as they set off from Gubbio for the highly anticipated &#8216;strade bianche&#8217; stage of the race.</p>\n<p>With dark clouds looming on the horizon, the breakaway clipped off with little resistance from the rest of the bunch. Five riders: Kaden Groves and Quinten Hermans (Alpecin-Deceuninck), their former teammate Dries De Bondt (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) and Milan Fretin (Cofidis) were the first to go clear.</p>\n<p>Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarche-Wanty) attacked to get across and was quickly joined by Luke Lamperti (Soudal-Quickstep). Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) tried to join the pair, but decided otherwise. It took Lamperti and Van der Hoorn a while to get across what was the breakaway&#8217;s maximum gap of three minutes. Eventually, the quartet decided to slow up and let them join, which they did with 160km still to race.</p>\n<p>From there on, the escapees were kept on a short leash. The peloton kept pushing at a rapid pace and held the six men up front to 1:30 for the bulk of the run-up to the gravel sectors.</p>\n<p>De Bondt led the breakaway through the first intermediate sprint in Mercatale after 46.6km of racing, while Hermans claimed the maximum prize atop the first classified climb, La Cima, at kilometre 52.6.</p>\n<p>Fretin overcooked a turn on the descent, but was up quickly and getting a spare bike further down the road. The incident slowed the breakaway, but once they got reorganised, their advantage went back out to 1:30. De Bondt led the escape through the second sprint in Sinalunga with 89.4km remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Pieve a Salti (8.0 km) &#8211; Pedersen shatters the peloton</strong><br />\nThe sun came out over the breakaway as they hit the first gravel sector with 68km to go. In the peloton behind, Van Aert led a full-on lead-out for the entrance to the sector, with Richard Carapaz slotting in near the front as they made the right turn into the gravel.</p>\n<p>The surge in pace reduced the breakaway&#8217;s gap to 1:15, and it fell further throughout the eight-kilometre stretch of gravel once ciclamino jersey wearer Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) came to the front and drilled the pace.</p>\n<p>In the breakaway, Fretin was struggling at the back with Groves and De Bondt as Van der Hoorn, Hermans, and Lamperti opened up a significant gap on the descent. But when the sector began to climb, Groves made it back to the leaders.</p>\n<p>Groves and Hermans left Van der Hoorn and Lamperti behind on the climb, expanding a gap that had been as low as 38 seconds back out to 45.</p>\n<p>Pedersen&#8217;s no-brakes descent spooked the peloton, too, with gaps forming all up and down the long line of chasers. Midway through the sector, Pedersen swept past Fretin with a group of 30 or so riders, including Giulio Ciccone, Juan Ayuso, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, and Tom Pidcock, but no maglia rosa. Ulissi was more than a minute behind the Pedersen group by the time they reached the tarmac.</p>\n<p>Pedersen continued to drive the pace, opening the gap to the pink jersey to 1:40.</p>\n<p><strong>Serravalle (9.3 km) &#8211; Disaster for Rogliƒç</strong><br />\nThe second gravel sector proved the adage that riders don&#8217;t win the Giro on a stage like this, but they certainly can lose it.</p>\n<p>The breakaway entered sector 2 with 41 seconds on the Pedersen-led peloton and heading flat-out into the hard right turn onto the gravel.</p>\n<p>Michael Storer (Tudor) crashed with a teammate on that turn. The gravel claimed another victim early in the sector when a crash from Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates XRG) took down Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) and Chris Hamilton (Ineos) with 51km to go.</p>\n<p>That incident disrupted the chase, but Egan Bernal and his teammates set off in pursuit of the leaders, who were a few seconds ahead.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç, whose bike was tangled up in the crash, was left chasing without teammates at first, but a group from behind bridged across and began to close the gap.</p>\n<p>At the front, the two remaining escapees, Groves and Hermans, were joined by Isaac del Toro (UAE), Van Aert, Thymen Arensman, Bernal, and Brandon Rivera (Ineos) to make a seven-man leading group with 3km of gravel still to cross.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç&#8217;s group had a minute to close when another disaster for the Slovenian struck before the end of the sector, when he had to stop for a bike change, leaving him chasing with hardly a breather between sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>San Martino in Grania (9.3 km) &#8211; Then there were four</strong><br />\nDust heavily obscuring the situation ahead, the third group couldn&#8217;t see that they were just 20 seconds behind the first chase containing Juan Ayuso, and Rogliƒç chasing with three others in a dust cloud further back.</p>\n<p>The groups ahead began to fracture on the steep climb. Groves, Hermans, and then Arensman were dropped from the lead group, leaving Van Aert, Bernal, Del Toro and Rivera at the front of the race.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç ended up in the second chasing group with Pidcock, Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) and Storer, while the maglia rosa group was almost three minutes behind with Ulissi in danger of losing the jersey.</p>\n<p>Bernal led the breakaway across the summit 44 seconds ahead of the Ayuso group, 1:17 over Rogliƒç and 3:23 on the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Once on the tarmac, Rivera kept the pace high with Bernal on his wheel, while Van Aert and Del Toro sat on. Chasing, Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) and Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) were in no-man&#8217;s land between the leaders and the first chase.</p>\n<p>Vacek left Harper behind and made it across to the leaders with 22.5km to go. Rivera&#8217;s solo work kept the first chase at 54 seconds while Rogliƒç&#8217;s group began to close down the gap to the riders ahead.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the short fourth sector, Rivera dropped off, having done his job, while Del Toro led the quartet onto the gravel, and only Van Aert could match his pace.</p>\n<p>Bernal lost touch briefly but clawed his way back with Vacek. They came off the sector with 1:13 on group 1, 1:55 on the second chase and 3:38 on the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Gee, sensing the chance to make up ground, attacked with 17km to go and was joined by Rogliƒç, but the surge in pace only served to reinvigorate the group behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Colle Pinzuto (2.3 km) &#8211; Then there were two</strong><br />\nThe Colle Pinzuto was the last chance for the GC riders to close the gap to Bernal. Del Toro pushed the pace at the start of the climb, pulling Van Aert away and leaving Bernal and Vacek behind.</p>\n<p>With the Red Bull time bonus sprint ahead, Del Toro pushed on full gas. Rogliƒç was losing more time to Ayuso, with the gap going out over one minute.</p>\n<p>Del Toro led over the sprint point ahead of Van Aert to take the six-second bonus, while Bernal picked up the two-second bonus for third.</p>\n<p>Heading toward the grand finale climb to the Piazza del Campo in Siena, the two leaders had 25 seconds on Bernal, 1:04 on Ayuso and 2:05 on Rogliƒç with the maglia rosa virtually on the shoulders of Del Toro, who started the stage 26 seconds down on Ulissi.</p>\n<p>Adam Yates led the chase as the Ayuso group caught Vacek and had a glimpse of Bernal in his sights. They brought the Colombian champion back with 6km to go.</p>\n<p>Del Toro led the entire way in, with Van Aert glued to the young Mexican&#8217;s wheel. He held on through the steepest part before taking the lead in the final few hundred metres.</p>\n<p>Van Aert claimed victory as Del Toro seized the maglia rosa, the first Mexican to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In the peloton behind, Van Aert led a full-on lead-out for the entrance to the sector, with Richard Carapaz slotting in near the front as they made the right turn into the gravel.</p>\n<p>The surge in pace reduced the breakaway&#8217;s gap to 1:15, and it fell further throughout the eight-kilometre stretch of gravel once ciclamino jersey wearer Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) came to the front and drilled the pace.</p>\n<p>In the breakaway, Fretin was struggling at the back with Groves and De Bondt as Van der Hoorn, Hermans, and Lamperti opened up a significant gap on the descent. But when the sector began to climb, Groves made it back to the leaders.</p>\n<p>Groves and Hermans left Van der Hoorn and Lamperti behind on the climb, expanding a gap that had been as low as 38 seconds back out to 45.</p>\n<p>Pedersen&#8217;s no-brakes descent spooked the peloton, too, with gaps forming all up and down the long line of chasers. Midway through the sector, Pedersen swept past Fretin with a group of 30 or so riders, including Giulio Ciccone, Juan Ayuso, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, and Tom Pidcock, but no maglia rosa. Ulissi was more than a minute behind the Pedersen group by the time they reached the tarmac.</p>\n<p>Pedersen continued to drive the pace, opening the gap to the pink jersey to 1:40.</p>\n<p><strong>Serravalle (9.3 km) &#8211; Disaster for Rogliƒç</strong><br />\nThe second gravel sector proved the adage that riders don&#8217;t win the Giro on a stage like this, but they certainly can lose it.</p>\n<p>The breakaway entered sector 2 with 41 seconds on the Pedersen-led peloton and heading flat-out into the hard right turn onto the gravel.</p>\n<p>Michael Storer (Tudor) crashed with a teammate on that turn. The gravel claimed another victim early in the sector when a crash from Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates XRG) took down Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) and Chris Hamilton (Ineos) with 51km to go.</p>\n<p>That incident disrupted the chase, but Egan Bernal and his teammates set off in pursuit of the leaders, who were a few seconds ahead.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç, whose bike was tangled up in the crash, was left chasing without teammates at first, but a group from behind bridged across and began to close the gap.</p>\n<p>At the front, the two remaining escapees, Groves and Hermans, were joined by Isaac del Toro (UAE), Van Aert, Thymen Arensman, Bernal, and Brandon Rivera (Ineos) to make a seven-man leading group with 3km of gravel still to cross.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç&#8217;s group had a minute to close when another disaster for the Slovenian struck before the end of the sector, when he had to stop for a bike change, leaving him chasing with hardly a breather between sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>San Martino in Grania (9.3 km) &#8211; Then there were four</strong><br />\nDust heavily obscuring the situation ahead, the third group couldn&#8217;t see that they were just 20 seconds behind the first chase containing Juan Ayuso, and Rogliƒç chasing with three others in a dust cloud further back.</p>\n<p>The groups ahead began to fracture on the steep climb. Groves, Hermans, and then Arensman were dropped from the lead group, leaving Van Aert, Bernal, Del Toro and Rivera at the front of the race.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç ended up in the second chasing group with Pidcock, Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) and Storer, while the maglia rosa group was almost three minutes behind with Ulissi in danger of losing the jersey.</p>\n<p>Bernal led the breakaway across the summit 44 seconds ahead of the Ayuso group, 1:17 over Rogliƒç and 3:23 on the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Once on the tarmac, Rivera kept the pace high with Bernal on his wheel, while Van Aert and Del Toro sat on. Chasing, Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) and Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) were in no-man&#8217;s land between the leaders and the first chase.</p>\n<p>Vacek left Harper behind and made it across to the leaders with 22.5km to go. Rivera&#8217;s solo work kept the first chase at 54 seconds while Rogliƒç&#8217;s group began to close down the gap to the riders ahead.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the short fourth sector, Rivera dropped off, having done his job, while Del Toro led the quartet onto the gravel, and only Van Aert could match his pace.</p>\n<p>Bernal lost touch briefly but clawed his way back with Vacek. They came off the sector with 1:13 on group 1, 1:55 on the second chase and 3:38 on the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Gee, sensing the chance to make up ground, attacked with 17km to go and was joined by Rogliƒç, but the surge in pace only served to reinvigorate the group behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Colle Pinzuto (2.3 km) &#8211; Then there were two</strong><br />\nThe Colle Pinzuto was the last chance for the GC riders to close the gap to Bernal. Del Toro pushed the pace at the start of the climb, pulling Van Aert away and leaving Bernal and Vacek behind.</p>\n<p>With the Red Bull time bonus sprint ahead, Del Toro pushed on full gas. Rogliƒç was losing more time to Ayuso, with the gap going out over one minute.</p>\n<p>Del Toro led over the sprint point ahead of Van Aert to take the six-second bonus, while Bernal picked up the two-second bonus for third.</p>\n<p>Heading toward the grand finale climb to the Piazza del Campo in Siena, the two leaders had 25 seconds on Bernal, 1:04 on Ayuso and 2:05 on Rogliƒç with the maglia rosa virtually on the shoulders of Del Toro, who started the stage 26 seconds down on Ulissi.</p>\n<p>Adam Yates led the chase as the Ayuso group caught Vacek and had a glimpse of Bernal in his sights. They brought the Colombian champion back with 6km to go.</p>\n<p>Del Toro led the entire way in, with Van Aert glued to the young Mexican&#8217;s wheel. He held on through the steepest part before taking the lead in the final few hundred metres.</p>\n<p>Van Aert claimed victory as Del Toro seized the maglia rosa, the first Mexican to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=9&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Despite the name of the race, since the addition of an individual time trial in 1963, the race has been held over a 5 or 6 day period for most of its history. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) claimed the fourth stage of the 4 Jours de Dunkerque, out-sprinting Movistar&#8217;s Carlos Canal on the uphill sprint to Cassel.

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Team Jayco‚ÄìAlUla) took a career-defining stage win at the Giro d&#8217;Italia after launching a stunning solo attack outside the final 40km on the hilly terrain of stage 8.</p>\n<p>Plapp rode triumphantly into Castelraimondo with a gap of 38 seconds over Wilco Kelderman (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) in second place, while Diego Ulissi (XDS Astana) finished third. The two riders formed a chase from the fragments of a substantial 19-man breakaway that broke free outside 100km to go.</p>\n<p>Plapp attacked over the summit of the category 3 climb of Montelago from a four-man attack and carved out an impressive gap through his heroic solo effort on the technical terrain that concluded the Apennine stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I still can&#8217;t believe it, to be honest,&#8221; Plapp said following the race finish. &#8220;I feel like it&#8217;s been a long time coming ‚Äì always targeting the Aussie summer, and just never been able to make a result happen in Europe.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year, got so close to the Giro so many times. And for today to happen is so, so special,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We marked it as a stage for a few weeks now, and then this morning on the bus,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;re really, really excited to make it happen ‚Äì it&#8217;s a dream come true.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked why he decided to attack with 45km remaining, Plapp replied, &#8220;I knew I couldn&#8217;t beat any of them in a sprint!&#8221;</p>\n<p>He went on to say, &#8220;I think the way the racing has been going this year, the long moves, have been really, really successful. So I just thought I&#8217;d give it a crack. And to be honest, just wanted a bit of a head start on the descent as well. To stay away all the way to the finish is definitely not what I expected.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking about his recent misfortune &#8211; a broken wrist in February and a fall on the opening time trial, Plapp said, &#8220;I mean, the lows in cycling are super, super low, and there&#8217;s a long time between highs. So to have a result like this is amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the main group, Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) attacked on the final ascent, but a determined UAE Team Emirates-XRG squad ensured he was given no grace. Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), however, managed to steal a few critical seconds from Roglic in the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>Diego Ulissi (XDS Astana) battled in the chase group, not only to reel in Plapp but in the hopes of claiming the maglia rosa from Primo≈æ Rogliƒç &#8211; having been the best placed GC rider in the front groups.</p>\n<p>His finishing margin of over four minutes over the maglia rosa group saw him take the race lead and pink jersey. He becomes the first Italian in four years to wear the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton set off below a stunning blue sky in the coastal town of Giulianova. Ahead of them was a 197km jagged profile stage, punctuated with the cat 1 ascent of the Sassotetto almost dead centre of the day&#8217;s route.</p>\n<p>The climb&#8217;s 13.1km at an average of 7.4% offered both the chance for breakaway success, or general classification disruption, and so it was no surprise that tensions were high in the undulating opening kilometres.</p>\n<p>Despite countless attacks, surprisingly, it was the man who had worn the maglia rosa himself only 48 hours ago who established the day&#8217;s first viable attack. Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) carved a gap along with Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) and Davide De Pretto (Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n<p>The trio were the dominant attackers of the first 50km, but the ascent of Croce di Casale proved enough of a challenge to bring them back.</p>\n<p>A brief move by Davide Piganzoli (Polti-VisitMalta), Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) and Nairo Quintana (Movistar) gained a mild lead over the summit, but the peloton soon pulled it in.</p>\n<p>On the approach to the intermediate sprint of Sarnano, it was a small, uncategorised climb that provided the launching pad for the day&#8217;s biggest breakaway, containing 19 riders.</p>\n<p>That breakaway consisted of Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Georg Steinhauser (EF Education &#8211; EasyPost), and Romain Bardet (Picnic PostNL), Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana), Jonathan Lastra (Team Cofidis), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Stefano Oldani (Team Cofidis), Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Marco Frigo (Israel &#8211; Premier Tech), Davide Formolo (Movistar Team), Damien Howson (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team), Koen Bouwman (Team Jayco‚ÄìAlUla), Luke Plapp (Team Jayco‚ÄìAlUla), Wilco Kelderman (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Dylan Van Baarle (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group &#8211; Bardiani CSF &#8211; Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Among the escapees, Romain Bardet proved to be the main aggressor of the day, forging a gap with Lorenzo Fortunato, Georg Steinhauser and Andrea Vendrame, before attacking solo from that group.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Diego Ulissi (XDS Astana), and Wilco Kelderman (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) bridged across to Bardet&#8217;s group, before Bardet and Steinhauser found themselves distanced and pulled back to the fragmented breakaway remnants.</p>\n<p>The new alliance at the front didn&#8217;t last long, with Plapp attacking Kelderman, Arrieta and Ulissi over the summit of the category 3 climb of Montelago, and the Australian used the technical descent to pry a gap of 40 seconds as the race entered the final 30km.</p>\n<p><strong>A solo finale</strong><br />\nThe peloton lingered 5:30 behind Plapp&#8217;s solo lead, and with Fortunato sitting in the virtual lead, it was time for the major teams to consider the general classification gaps that may emerge on the stage.</p>\n<p>Ahead, the winding route to Castelraimondo had just the category 3 climb to Gagliole within the final 10km, and Plapp showed no sign of losing his advantage, as he slipped over the one-minute mark entering the final 25km.</p>\n<p>The trio of Kelderman, Arrieta and Ulissi rode in an impressively cohesive chase, but Plapp seemed fixed in an unstoppable rhythm upfront, even distancing the main peloton by over six minutes.</p>\n<p>The chase also took on a new significance, with Italians Ulissi and Fortunato hovering in and out of the virtual race lead, meaning the pink jersey race was now to be determined between these two chase groups, both of which had formed from the day&#8217;s original breakaway.</p>\n<p>Arrieta did Ulissi no favours when he attacked the duo of Kelderman and Ulissi, grasping for sight of Plapp. Despite initially chipping into Plapp&#8217;s leading margin, Arrieta was unable to make any serious challenge to the Australian&#8217;s lead, while derailing the original rhythm of the three-man break. Ulissi probably wouldn&#8217;t hold it against him, though, after claiming the maglia rosa only a few kilometres later.</p>\n<p>With 10km left, only a small climb ahead of him and a gap of over a minute, Plapp was looking at an open road to stage victory, and all eyes were on the solo escapee.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

And for today to happen is so, so special,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We marked it as a stage for a few weeks now, and then this morning on the bus,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We&#8217;re really, really excited to make it happen ‚Äì it&#8217;s a dream come true.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked why he decided to attack with 45km remaining, Plapp replied, &#8220;I knew I couldn&#8217;t beat any of them in a sprint!&#8221;</p>\n<p>He went on to say, &#8220;I think the way the racing has been going this year, the long moves, have been really, really successful. So I just thought I&#8217;d give it a crack. And to be honest, just wanted a bit of a head start on the descent as well. To stay away all the way to the finish is definitely not what I expected.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking about his recent misfortune &#8211; a broken wrist in February and a fall on the opening time trial, Plapp said, &#8220;I mean, the lows in cycling are super, super low, and there&#8217;s a long time between highs. So to have a result like this is amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the main group, Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) attacked on the final ascent, but a determined UAE Team Emirates-XRG squad ensured he was given no grace. Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), however, managed to steal a few critical seconds from Roglic in the finishing sprint.</p>\n<p>Diego Ulissi (XDS Astana) battled in the chase group, not only to reel in Plapp but in the hopes of claiming the maglia rosa from Primo≈æ Rogliƒç &#8211; having been the best placed GC rider in the front groups.</p>\n<p>His finishing margin of over four minutes over the maglia rosa group saw him take the race lead and pink jersey. He becomes the first Italian in four years to wear the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton set off below a stunning blue sky in the coastal town of Giulianova. Ahead of them was a 197km jagged profile stage, punctuated with the cat 1 ascent of the Sassotetto almost dead centre of the day&#8217;s route.</p>\n<p>The climb&#8217;s 13.1km at an average of 7.4% offered both the chance for breakaway success, or general classification disruption, and so it was no surprise that tensions were high in the undulating opening kilometres.</p>\n<p>Despite countless attacks, surprisingly, it was the man who had worn the maglia rosa himself only 48 hours ago who established the day&#8217;s first viable attack. Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) carved a gap along with Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) and Davide De Pretto (Jayco-AlUla).</p>\n<p>The trio were the dominant attackers of the first 50km, but the ascent of Croce di Casale proved enough of a challenge to bring them back.</p>\n<p>A brief move by Davide Piganzoli (Polti-VisitMalta), Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) and Nairo Quintana (Movistar) gained a mild lead over the summit, but the peloton soon pulled it in.</p>\n<p>On the approach to the intermediate sprint of Sarnano, it was a small, uncategorised climb that provided the launching pad for the day&#8217;s biggest breakaway, containing 19 riders.</p>\n<p>That breakaway consisted of Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Georg Steinhauser (EF Education &#8211; EasyPost), and Romain Bardet (Picnic PostNL), Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana), Jonathan Lastra (Team Cofidis), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Stefano Oldani (Team Cofidis), Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Marco Frigo (Israel &#8211; Premier Tech), Davide Formolo (Movistar Team), Damien Howson (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team), Koen Bouwman (Team Jayco‚ÄìAlUla), Luke Plapp (Team Jayco‚ÄìAlUla), Wilco Kelderman (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Dylan Van Baarle (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike), Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group &#8211; Bardiani CSF &#8211; Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Among the escapees, Romain Bardet proved to be the main aggressor of the day, forging a gap with Lorenzo Fortunato, Georg Steinhauser and Andrea Vendrame, before attacking solo from that group.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Diego Ulissi (XDS Astana), and Wilco Kelderman (Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike) bridged across to Bardet&#8217;s group, before Bardet and Steinhauser found themselves distanced and pulled back to the fragmented breakaway remnants.</p>\n<p>The new alliance at the front didn&#8217;t last long, with Plapp attacking Kelderman, Arrieta and Ulissi over the summit of the category 3 climb of Montelago, and the Australian used the technical descent to pry a gap of 40 seconds as the race entered the final 30km.</p>\n<p><strong>A solo finale</strong><br />\nThe peloton lingered 5:30 behind Plapp&#8217;s solo lead, and with Fortunato sitting in the virtual lead, it was time for the major teams to consider the general classification gaps that may emerge on the stage.</p>\n<p>Ahead, the winding route to Castelraimondo had just the category 3 climb to Gagliole within the final 10km, and Plapp showed no sign of losing his advantage, as he slipped over the one-minute mark entering the final 25km.</p>\n<p>The trio of Kelderman, Arrieta and Ulissi rode in an impressively cohesive chase, but Plapp seemed fixed in an unstoppable rhythm upfront, even distancing the main peloton by over six minutes.</p>\n<p>The chase also took on a new significance, with Italians Ulissi and Fortunato hovering in and out of the virtual race lead, meaning the pink jersey race was now to be determined between these two chase groups, both of which had formed from the day&#8217;s original breakaway.</p>\n<p>Arrieta did Ulissi no favours when he attacked the duo of Kelderman and Ulissi, grasping for sight of Plapp. Despite initially chipping into Plapp&#8217;s leading margin, Arrieta was unable to make any serious challenge to the Australian&#8217;s lead, while derailing the original rhythm of the three-man break. Ulissi probably wouldn&#8217;t hold it against him, though, after claiming the maglia rosa only a few kilometres later.</p>\n<p>With 10km left, only a small climb ahead of him and a gap of over a minute, Plapp was looking at an open road to stage victory, and all eyes were on the solo escapee.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Despite the name of the race, since the addition of an individual time trial in 1963, the race has been held over a 5 or 6 day period for most of its history. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Pierre Gautherat (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) struck out solo on a huge attack in the final kilometre and captured the first professional victory of his career on stage 3 of the 4 Jours de Dunkerque.</p>\n<p>Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech) finished second in the rush behind which could not close down the 22-year-old&#8217;s acceleration, while Alex Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) took third. </p>\n<p>With bonus seconds, Zingle holds on to the GC lead headed into the final two stages on the weekend. Lewis Askey (Groupama-FDJ), who finished fifth on the stage, dropped from second to third on GC.</p>\n<p>Gautherat, who was second last Sunday at Tro-Bro L√©on, jumped 14 spots to take Askey&#8217;s place on second in the overall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had told myself I would win this week, and I did,&#8221; he said after the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFrom the start in Valenciennes, the peloton headed south for 5km to pass near Famars, then begin a counter-clockwise loop of 25km, repeated six times. Each full lap included two sections of cobblestones, Qu√©r√©naing √† Maing (2.6km long) and Famars √† Artes, the latter set up by a punchy, categorised climb of half a kilometre at Maing.</p>\n<p>With 100km to go, a group of four ventured off together for the first breakaway &#8211; Antoine Huby (Soudal-QuickStep), Casper Pedersen, Killian Th√©ot (Van Rysel Roubaix) and Javier Ib√°√±ez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA). They opened an account of three minutes, but were reeled back to the peloton with 61km to go.</p>\n<p>More attacks followed across the next 20km, with a move from Alec Segaert (Lotto), Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) and Matis Louvel (Israel-Premier Tech) looking strong. </p>\n<p>With 35km to go, the lead trio headed to the dry, dusty pave and their banked time depleted to under one minute and then saw a reconnection from behind, Cofidis, Israel-Premier Tech, Soudal-QuickStep and Uno-X involved at the front of the chase.</p>\n<p>After a few more unsuccessful attacks, the peloton was together for the sixth and final circuit. Gil Gelders (Soudal-QuickStep) accelerated away with 20km to go. He stayed away for 8km, caught and passed with a fight for position at the front by Groupama-FDJ, riding for Askey, and Ineos Grenadiers, riding for Ben Swift, but no Visma-Lease a Bike yellow jerseys close by, yet, in support of Zingle.</p>\n<p>The road narrowed and the pace slackened on the approach to the final pass of cobbles, with a small downhill on the second half of the sector, then 4km to the finish. Groupama-FDJ quickly put two riders at the front with Askey. Then Cedric Beullens and Elia Viviani manoeuvred to the front for Lotto, setting the pace back on the tarmac.</p>\n<p>Italian champion Alberto Bettiol (XDS Astana) sparked a noticeable acceleration in the peloton with 2.2km to go on the flat run-in to the finish, and headed through the roundabout that signalled the final kilometre, Gautherat struck out solo on a huge attack, which proved successful and just held off late reactions from the favourites.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=175&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=175&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) struck the first major GC blow of the 2025 Giro d‚ÄôItalia, sealing victory on the race‚Äôs first summit finish on stage 7 in Tagliacozzo with a late burst 550 metres from the finish line.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard led home his teammate Isaac Del Toro for a UAE one-two to close out the 168km stage through the Apennines of Abruzzo, while Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) impressed to finish in third, having struck out with an attack of his own inside the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>The final climb to the line had been a slow burn, with the gentler slopes of the opening 9km giving way to double-digit gradients in the final 3km. Following work by Ineos Grenadiers and Bahrain Victorious on the way up, attacks by Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) kicked off the GC action.</p>\n<p>Bernal, looking stronger than he has since before his horrific training crash in early 2022, was next to hit the front along with his teammate Thymen Arensman, before he too made a move 800 metres from the top.</p>\n<p>It was a powerful move, but not the winning one. Instead, that fell to Ayuso, who revved up from seventh wheel as Bernal, Del Toro, and Ciccone led at the front. The 22-year-old muscled his way to the front and sped away during the closing 400 metres, putting four seconds ‚Äì plus a 10-second time bonus ‚Äì between himself and the rest as he sped to his sixth win of the season.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fourth Grand Tour, and especially in the two Vuelta a Espa√±as I raced I was sometimes very close, but I never managed to pull it off, so to finally do it today in my first Giro d&#8217;Italia is something super special and I will always remember,&#8221; Ayuso said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew that I only had to do one attack, I couldn&#8217;t mess around and do two or three. In these finals, which are super explosive, you only have one bullet to use. So I let others start attacking before, and then when I saw my distance, I went full gas into the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Behind Bernal and Del Toro, it was Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) who recovered to take fourth place. The Slovenian had been on the defensive rather than on the front foot as the GC men did battle on the steep upper inclines of the climb.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the 2023 champion is back in the maglia rosa of race leader overnight, with race leader Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) having dropped back from the peloton early on the slopes of the 12km finishing ascent.</p>\n<p>He returns in the race lead and may remain in pink for some time with a strade bianche stage and a time trial the biggest GC challenges before the next summit finish on stage 16. He leads Ayuso by four seconds, while Del Toro lies in third place at nine seconds down.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 7 of the Giro d‚ÄôItalia posed the riders their toughest challenge of the race so far with 3,390 metres of ascent lying on the 168km course in the form of four classified climbs.</p>\n<p>The peloton headed north-west across Abruzzo from Castel di Sangro to Tagliacozzo with the third-category climb of Roccaraso (7.8km at 5.8%) to start the day. Monte Urano (5.7km at 8%) followed at 70km before the 21.6km, 3.6% second-category climb of the Vado della Forcella at 104.9km. The day‚Äôs final climb, the race‚Äôs first summit finish at the first-category climb of Tagliacozzo, measured in at 11.9km and an average of 5.5%.</p>\n<p>With nine mountain classification points available 7km into the stage atop Roccaraso, it was no surprise that the battle for the breakaway began as soon as the flag dropped. The blue jersey of classification leader Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) was prominent at the front and the Italian duly led the way over the top.</p>\n<p>Nine points there took his mountain classification total to 58, 36 clear of Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), who took third on the climb.</p>\n<p>Fortunato didn‚Äôt push on over the plateau following the peak, however. Instead, his Astana teammate Cristian Scaroni ventured out into the break. He was joined by the intermediate sprint and fuga prize leader Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) on his third day in the break, plus Gianmarco Garofoli (Soudal-QuickStep), and Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe controlled the situation at the front of the peloton, though Paul Double (Jayco-AlUla), Gijs Leemreize (Picnic-PostNL), and Red Bull Kilometre classification leader Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) also made it across to the break in time for the long descent following the plateau.</p>\n<p>Tonelli duly led the seven-man break over the day‚Äôs first intermediate sprint, 50km into the stage at Sulmona, while the move hit an advantage of 2:30 on the road to the second climb of the stage, Monte Urano.</p>\n<p>At the top of the climb, Double sprinted across the line first to claim 18 points. Tonelli followed for eight with Scaroni taking six points for third place.</p>\n<p>The uphill run to Vado della Forcella was next on the menu, with the break extending their lead to four minutes on the long drag. At the top, Double once again struck out to lead the race over another climb, picking up another 18 points in the process.</p>\n<p>Behind him, Tarozzi and Leemreize followed, with the seven-man group regrouping before the second intermediate sprint at Ovindoli and the subsequent descent. Tonelli, clearly targeting the intermediate sprint prize, led the way through Ovindoli and into the final 50km as 3:15 separated the break and peloton.</p>\n<p>The gap would only decrease as the riders flew down the interrupted descent towards the valley in Avezzano. Lidl-Trek and race leader Mads Pedersen joined the chase, with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe also on the front as they had been all day.</p>\n<p>Once the race hit the valley, with 30km left to run, the gap to the leaders had fallen to 1:30, while at the rear of the peloton Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL) was receiving treatment at the medical, having fallen on the long descent.</p>\n<p>Another Frenchman, David Gaudu, saw his entire Groupama-FDJ squad drop back on the flat as he struggled to get back on following a fall of his own. They made it back in time for the Red Bull Kilometre and start of the climb up Marsia above the town of Tagliacozzo, while up front Tarozzi led through the sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>The final climb</strong><br />\nIneos Grenadiers hit the front to start the ascent, the peloton now just 40 seconds behind the break, 12km from the top. Scaroni, Double, and Leemreize were the first riders to drop back to the peloton, while maglia rosa Pedersen was quick to slip back from the rear of the group.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious were next to take over the pacemaking, leading to the remainder of the break being caught 5km from the line. The peloton remained large on the gentler slopes leading into the tougher closing 3km, however.</p>\n<p>The double-digit gradients bit at the top of the climb, meaning the top favourites and best climbers of the Giro led the way at the front for the first time in this year‚Äôs race.</p>\n<p>Rafa≈Ç Majka took it over for UAE Team Emirates-XRG at 2.5km to go, the Pole working for Juan Ayuso and Adam Yates as the likes of Egan Bernal, Primo≈æ Roglic, Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), and Giulio Ciccone followed close behind.</p>\n<p>At 1.5km to go, the lead group had slimmed down to around 20 men, while Ciccone struck out soon after to kick off the GC attacks. Bernal was the quickest to react, dragging the Italian back before his Ineos teammate Thymen Arensman took over to lead the group into the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>The Dutchman pulled until the 800-metre marker, at which point Bernal launched his move. Behind the Colombian champion, Del Toro, Ciccone, and Tiberi lined up in pursuit, while Rogliƒç was rarely in shot and certainly not taking the initiative at the front.</p>\n<p>Instead, it was Ayuso who landed the biggest blow. The 22-year-old Spaniard accelerated from seventh wheel, manoeuvring past Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL) and the Bahrain pairing of Tiberi and Damiano Caruso before passing Ciccone, Bernal and Del Toro.</p>\n<p>Once Ayuso hit the front, there was no coming back for his rivals, with his turn of pace unmatchable on the run to the finish.</p>\n<p>Del Toro came past Ciccone and Bernal to seal a one-two for UAE at the line, while Bernal held off Rogliƒç on the flatter finish to round out the stage podium.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) sprinted to victory on stage 6 of the Giro d&#8217;Italia, winning in Naples on a day that was defined by crashes and chaos.</p>\n<p>Groves won by quite a margin ahead of Milan Fretin (Cofidis) and Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep), reaping the rewards of Alpecin-Deceuninck&#8217;s organisation in a hectic sprint.</p>\n<p>It was a frantic finale that saw the peloton only catch the breakaway duo of Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ) with 2.5km to go. A late flyer from Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) then threatened an upset, but he was swept up, and his sprinter Olav Kooij finished outside of the top 5 after a messy effort from Visma.</p>\n<p>Three-time stage winner Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) did not figure in the sprint after easing up in the finale and finishing in a group behind the main peloton, but will remain in the race lead because of the neutralisation.</p>\n<p>After a mass crash with 70km to go forced the race to stop, the GC times for the stage were neutralised, meaning all riders were given the same time on the line regardless of gaps, with no bonus seconds or sprint points awarded.</p>\n<p>That meant that despite not finishing in the main group, Pedersen holds onto the race lead for another day and will wear the pink jersey in stage 7.</p>\n<p>As well as the crash earlier in the day, a spectator appearing to hold a sign walked into the road in the final three kilometres, which disrupted the riders, but they avoided any serious incident.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not been a great start to the season.

They always do a super job,&#8221; Groves said.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Giro&#8217;s longest stage started in Potenza, with 227km of racing on the way to Naples and an expected bunch sprint on the flat finish. Despite the flat final 60km, there was plenty of climbing packed into the long day, with the 20km Valico di Monte Carruozzo and the 14.6km Monteforte Irpino to contend with on the way.</p>\n<p>Despite the likelihood of a sprint finish, there was a big battle for the day&#8217;s breakaway, with various moves going and coming back in the first 30km, and it wasn&#8217;t until kilometre 32 that an attack from Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) seemed to draw out the day&#8217;s established break. The Dutchman initially went away alone, but was then joined by Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ) as the peloton settled and seemed happy for the pair to go up the road for the day.</p>\n<p>On the first climb, Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) attacked to chase down mountains points, with Lucas Hamilton (Ineos Grenadiers) briefly trying to follow but failing to hold on. The Italian successfully joined the break and took the maximum points over the climb, but then sat up to wait for the peloton as the leaders&#8217; gap increased to over three minutes with 150km to go.</p>\n<p>At the intermediate sprint in Lioni, Van der Hoorn and Paleni picked up the maximum points, while behind Pedersen, Kooij and Jensen Plowright (Alpecin-Deceuninck) battled for the remaining points, with Plowright winning the three-way battle ahead of Kooij, who edged out Pedersen.</p>\n<p>From here, the situation remained stable through the main middle part of the race, though the leaders&#8217; advantage did slowly but steadily come down as the day went on, falling under a minute with still 90km to go.</p>\n<p><strong>Crash and neutralisation</strong></p>\n<p>The rain started to fall in the second half of the race, and the slick roads were to blame for a big, widespread crash on a downhill with 70km to go. More than 40 riders went down or were held up, including Jai Hindley, Adam Yates, Derek Gee and Richard Carapaz. With so many riders down, the race was then neutralised, and the peloton were held at a speed of 20km/h to allow riders to make it back on.</p>\n<p>Whilst most riders resumed riding, Hindley stayed down for a long time after appearing to take the heaviest fall, and he later climbed into an ambulance, putting an end to his Giro d&#8217;Italia. Josef ƒåern√Ω (Soudal-QuickStep) also got into an ambulance but then continued riding, whilst Juri Hollmann (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Dion Smith (Intermarch√©-Wanty) later joined the abandons.</p>\n<p>After a few kilometres of neutralised riding, it was announced on race radio that the race would be paused entirely with riders brought to a complete stop to allow things to regroup. Despite some protest from some riders, the break and peloton did all stop with 60km to go.</p>\n<p>With the race stopped, the discussions between the riders, organisers and commissaires continued, but after only a few minutes of stoppage, racing restarted with the breakaway given their one-minute gap back.</p>\n<p><strong>A close finale in Naples</strong><br />\nAfter the restart, given the weather and poor roads into Naples, it was confirmed that the GC times would be neutralised for the stage, with the whole peloton being given the same time at the finish regardless of gaps, with no time limit and no bonus seconds for the top three, or sprint points.  Moreover, there were no points or time bonuses awarded at the Red Bull Kilometre with 52km to go.</p>\n<p>Despite the GC neutralisation, there was still a stage win up for grabs, and Visma-Lease a Bike and Alpecin-Deceuninck started to ride to bring the break back in the final 50km. Lidl-Trek were noticeably missing from the front of the peloton, with Pedersen easing up and dropping into a second group, with his race lead safe due to the GC neutralisation.</p>\n<p>With 20km to go, Paleni and Van der Hoorn still had a 30-second lead, despite the best efforts of Visma, Alpecin and Picnic PostNL ‚Äì with many GC teams taking the opportunity to take it easy into Naples, there was less firepower to close the gap.</p>\n<p>They held a gap into the final 10km, and then with 5km to go, their lead was still 20 seconds as it looked touch-and-go whether the catch would actually materialise. Visma lost some organisation on the city roads, giving way to a more organised chase from Alpecin-Deceuninck, and it was the Belgian team who made the catch with 2.5km to go.</p>\n<p>The organisation of the lead-outs fell apart somewhat in the final kilometre, with Jensen Plowright (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Van Aert flying off the front of the bunch without their sprinters on their wheels, but Alpecin&#8217;s effort paid off nevertheless, and a perfectly-launched sprint delivered Groves to the win with breathing room behind him.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Despite the name of the race, since the addition of an individual time trial in 1963, the race has been held over a 5 or 6 day period for most of its history. Since 2005, the race has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) earned the victory on the first day of 4 Jours de Dunkerque, taking advantage of an unorganised sprint train by Israel-Premier Tech in the closing 200 metres into Amiens.</p>\n<p>Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL) trailed the Frenchman for second place while Stian Fredheim (Uno-X Mobility) grabbed third, keeping Classique Dunkerque winner Pascal Ackermann (Israel-Premier Tech) off the podium by one position.</p>\n<p>A five-rider breakaway still had hopes to remain clear on the first passage of the finish line with 24km to go ‚Äì Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Luca de Meester, Gil Gelders, Danny van der Tuuk, and Per Strand Hagenes. With 6.2km to go, their day ended, and the sprint teams went to work. However, Ackermann could not find the wheel of his lead-out man Jake Stewart and Zingle used the slipstream to score his first victory of the season.</p>\n<p>Zingle crashed on Tuesday at Classique Dunkerque, a new 1.Pro race ahead of 4 Jours de Dunkerque stage race, and remnants of a tough day across northern France lingered with a left leg bandage.</p>\n<p>He told French broadcasters after the race that he was happy to rebound from the crash and secure the leader&#8217;s jersey, though the team was focused on individual stages rather than the GC.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the fastest sprinter at the start, but I know I can position myself well in the final kilometers. Thankfully, everything went perfectly today. I&#8217;m incredibly happy with this win, especially after being involved in a crash at the finish yesterday,&#8221; Zingle said after the finish in a team statement.</p>\n<p>The five riders in the breakaway scooped up enough bonus points to position them directly behind Zingle in the GC standings, with Swift second on GC, two seconds back, and Hagenes third, three seconds back.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThis year marked the 69th edition of the &#8216;Four Days of Dunkirk&#8217;, and the first of five stages took place Wednesday between Sainte-Catherine and Amiens with 177.3km</p>\n<p>The first of five categorised climbs hit in the opening 6.5km and there were no takers on a solid attack for an early breakaway. It was not until the approach to the next climbing section that a group of six pushed away from the peloton ‚Äì Swift, Gelders, Hagenes, De Meester and Van der Tuuk accompanied by Joren Bloem (Unibet Tietema Rockets).</p>\n<p>The group gained two minutes as they moved across the trio of climbs packed between just 13 kilometres, the intermediate sprint in Fr√©mont serving as the launch 57.5km into the race for the first ascent to Ligny-sur-Canche. Bloem dropped away from the lead group after the climb.</p>\n<p>The Boubers-sur-Canche followed and then the longest and steepest of the trio, at 1.4km and 5.4% average gradient, the Mochel-sur-Canche left 57km to the finish for the group of now five riders.</p>\n<p>The gap began to fade as the lead group moved to the third and final intermediate sprint at Amiens just before the finish line, 24km remained across two more full circuits for the finish.</p>\n<p>The riders in the break worked together on the penultimate circuit, the gap hovering around a minute, but teams like Uno-X Mobility and Israel-Premier Tech had other ideas, reeling them into peloton with just 6km to go.</p>\n<p>The run to the line in the final kilometre was a bit messy, with three Israel-Premier Tech riders among the dozen riders near the front, but they were spread across the road. Zingle was the only Visma rider in the bunch, riding in eighth place. </p>\n<p>Once around a final left-hand bend to the straightaway, Zingle was still well back as Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) and Alberto Dainese (Tudor) were in the line in front of him being towed by Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech). </p>\n<p>When Stewart looked around and moved away from the front of the race, Ackermann was not on his wheel, but Zingle, who punched his way across the final 75 metres for the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=175&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=175&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But I had a really hard time there. I used a lot of energy to move back up to Vacek&#8217;s wheel. I had to spend energy to come back to at least fight for the win. Then, luckily, I had enough for the last sprint. It was a tough one.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible to win and in this jersey too. It&#8217;s insane and way more than I ever dreamed about. What a Giro we have, and what a team I have around me. Every day, we try to win as much as possible. We try again tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The win, and resulting 10-second time bonus, sees Pedersen extend his overall lead to 17 seconds, with Rogliƒç, 12th on the day, remaining in second place. Vacek lies in third at 24 seconds down.</p>\n<p>With six points at the day‚Äôs two intermediate sprints and another 50 at the line, Pedersen also extends his lead in the maglia ciclamino.

Alpecin-Deceuninck deployed Jensen Plowright to deny Pedersen‚Äôs charge to the line, but the Dane scooped up the six points, nevertheless.</p>\n<p>As the race turned inland towards the Red Bull Kilometre at Bernalda and the finish in Matera, the breakaway trio carried a reduced lead of 1:40. In the peloton, VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√® duo Filippo Magli and Alessandro Pinarello suffered a minor double crash before Bernalda, while up the road Epis scored 15 points and six bonus seconds at the Red Bull-emblazoned sprint.</p>\n<p>Epis would be the first man from the breakaway caught by the peloton after he dropped back following attacks from Bais and Milesi heading into the final 40km. He was reabsorbed with 32km to go, 4km before the top of the climb at Montescaglioso.</p>\n<p>In the peloton, Lidl-Trek were joined by UAE Team Emirates-XRG on the front. The subsequent upping of the pace on the 8.5% incline saw sprinters including Kooij, Van Uden, Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck), and Sam Bennett (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) drop away.</p>\n<p>Up front, the break hung on with an ever-reducing advantage, one that would fall under the minute-mark heading into the final 25km. Further back, riders including Groves, Max Kanter (XDS-Astana), and Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) made their way back to the peloton between the hills, though many more, including Kooij and Van Uden, wouldn‚Äôt return.</p>\n<p>Work on the front by UAE and EF Education-EasyPost heading up the unclassified Castello Tramontano meant Milesi and Bais were brought back with 12km to go. With Milesi back in the group, Movistar joined the fray, too, while several other teams, including Lidl-Trek, also lurked.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease A Bike were among the teams working on the front inside the final 10km, but their man, Wout van Aert, who once upon a time might have thrived on this terrain, was dropped 4km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe took over on the unclassified rise at 3km to go, with Rogliƒç‚Äôs squad ‚Äì and Vacek‚Äôs own pace ‚Äì seemingly too much for Pedersen. Several climbers, including Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers), were also up front, but they‚Äôd give way once more on the flatter roads following the hill.</p>\n<p>The maglia rosa of Pedersen floated back to the front as easily as he had gone backwards, with him and Vacek again proving a winning pairing in the final metres of the race.

He swept through the intermediate sprint in Polignano a Mare with four minutes.

Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) sprinted to the four-second time bonus just ahead of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). The bonus moved Rogliƒç two seconds closer to Pedersen&#8217;s maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>The next intermediate sprint was too tempting for Lidl-Trek, and the surge brought Mu√±oz back into the fold with 56.5km to go.

The team also had to expend resources to help their GC hopeful Giulio Ciccone get back into the bunch, leaving Pedersen to handle the sprint on his own.</p>\n<p>On the final lap, Ineos Grenadiers led the bunch to keep Egan Bernal safe, as a sharp narrowing and several turns posed a danger of crashes.

Orluis Aular (Movistar) was again in the thick of the sprint, taking third.</p>\n<p>Pedersen took a ten-second time bonus and so took back the maglia rosa from Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). The Slovenian finished safely in the peloton and is now second overall, at nine seconds. Pedersen&#8217;s teammate Mathias Vacek is third overall at 14 seconds.</p>\n<p>Pedersen will wear the maglia rosa on Tuesday for stage 4 from Alberobello to Lecce when the Giro d&#8217;Italia resumes in Puglia after a day of travel from Albania to Italy on Monday.</p>\n<p>Pedersen now has 52 career victories, apparently making him the most successful  pro rider in the history of Danish cycling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having two victories and now back in the pink jersey is exactly what we wanted today. This was the plan this morning,&#8221; Pedersen explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to put a good pace on the long climb, to control it for ourselves and give me a chance to breathe there so I didn&#8217;t need to go over the limit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone from the team did a super amazing job on the climb and before. From the climb, it was about controlling as far as we could and then it would be a drag race. It was exactly as we wanted it with Ciccone and Vacek giving me an amazing lead out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ciccone has ambitions somewhere else in the race but he was there to help me, that shows his character. He committed to the team and to helping me. It shows what we can do at Lidl-Trek. I can&#8217;t wait to get to the mountains and give something back to Cicco.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe sun was out in Valona for the 160km third stage, with riders facing a long loop into the Albania hills before a fast finish back in the holiday resort in the south of Albania.</p>\n<p>Valona is just across the Adriatic Sea from Puglia in southern Italy, where the riders headed post stage by plane for the first rest day/travel day of the 2025 Corsa Rosa.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç looked resplendent in magia rosa but the Slovenian was keen to let someone else take the leader&#8217;s jersey and all the extra responsibilities that come with it.</p>\n<p>Pedersen was the most likely candidate but the rest of the peloton sensed Rogliƒç&#8217;s desire and the attacks came fast and furious in the opening kilometres, as riders tried to join the right break of the day.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) made an early move and Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) sneaked into a split as the peloton lined out on the valley road south of Valona.</p>\n<p>After a high-speed 20 minutes, a break was finally allowed some freedom. Stage 2 winner Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers), Mark Donovan (Q36.5), Lorenzo Germani (Groupama-FDJ) and Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL) were there. Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) and Dries De Bondt (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) set off in pursuit just before the peloton closed down other other surges and then eased up, closing down the road.</p>\n<p>The sextet had their chance, with Tarling the best placed rider in the GC at 1:34. The young Welsh rider became the virtual race leader but the peloton kept them under control.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe accepted their race leader responsibilities and led the peloton, with Jacopo Mosca (Lidl-Trek) often helping Gianni Moscon and Nico Denz with the work on the front. They pinned the gap to below 3:00.</p>\n<p>Tonelli won the intermediate sprint in Gjorm after 34km and the stage steadied. The late climb and chase to the finish would be the decisive moment of the day. A rush of adrenaline came mid-stage when a goal ran into the road and almost took out Dion Smith (Intermarche-Wanty). He used his bike skills to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Donovan was the first over the Shakelles climb after 65km as the breakaways shared the glory and the prizes. The terrain was now very barren and constantly rolling in the hills.</p>\n<p>De Bondt and the breakaways rolled through the Red Bull KM in Himar√´ with 88km raced and 71km to go but at least this time, the six, four and two bonus seconds would have little impact on the race.</p>\n<p>The country roads sparked several punctures, with Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) forced to take a teammate&#8217;s bike for a while but he was soon back into the peloton. De Bondt also suffered a puncture and so was dropped from the break near the Gjilek√´ intermediate sprint with 52km to race.</p>\n<p>The rolling roads had hurt many in the peloton and the break, with a number of sprinters forced to chase. It was a sign of things to come on the category 2, 10.5km long Qafa e Llogaras√´ climb.</p>\n<p>The Qafa e Llogaras√´ climbed high into the Albanian mountains, with a 9.6% section after three kilometres and then an average gradient of 7.4%.</p>\n<p>The climb began after 110km, with 50km to go. Pedersen was there and looked good but others were suffering. Lidl-Trek took control of the peloton with poise and clam, Daan Hoole leading the peloton at the start the Qafa e Llogaras√´ climb.</p>\n<p>The pace was soon high and hurting and Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was soon dropped from the peloton, as were others. The break also fell apart as the peloton closed the gap to less than a minute. Tarling was dropped after a second day in the spotlight and second impressive performance.</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) and Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) attacked from the peloton in a clever move to try to win the stage. They soon joined Hamilton and Tonelli at the front of the race with Germani just off the back and Donovan left behind.</p>\n<p>Hamilton was the last man from the original break to stay with Fortunato and Bilbao as they neared the summit. Behind Lidl-Trek continued to carefully pace the peloton, with Tom Pidcock playfully surging on the front to see the effects. Fortunato was first to the summit of the Qafa e Llogaras√´ ahead of Bilbao, to ensure he would pull on the Maglia Azzurra points jersey.</p>\n<p>The two were just 50 seconds ahead of the peloton, as the GC riders massed on the front for the descent. Only 50 or so riders were left in the peloton but Pedersen was there.</p>\n<p>The descent led down into the valley through the mist but the roads were wide and smooth. With 30km to go, Fortunato and Bilbao had a gap of 45 seconds but the peloton and especially Lidl-Trek were hunting them down on the road to Valona. On the fast valley run to the finish, some sprinters managed to get back on, including Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizane), swelling the front group to 80 or so riders.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek eventually swept up Fortunato and Bilbao with 18km to race and suddenly the sprint was on. Pedersen would need to finish in the top three to take back the pink jersey thanks to the time bonuses.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious took control of the peloton in the final ten kilometres, leading along the coast road as if racing Milan-San Remo. All the GC teams wanted to keep their leaders safe until the final three kilometres, where times would be taken in case of a subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe also rode carefully to keep Rogliƒç upfront and safe on the single lane seafront road. There was a fight for position and the best wheels but without any excess risk or danger. The worst moment was when a dog ran across the road just in front of the riders.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek led out the sprint with Giulio Ciccone leading the way, a climber and the team&#8217;s GC leader also committed to Pedersen&#8217;s success. Mathias Vacek was behind him with everyone else fighting for the wheels in their slipstream.</p>\n<p>Vacek gradually wound-up his leadout, his hands wider on the levers. Nobody went early and so Pedersen hit out from the front, convinced of his speed and seeing victory and the maglia rosa ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Strong came up late but Pedersen was in charge, just as he and Lidl-Trek had been all day. Their reward was a second stage win and the maglia rosa back on Pedersen&#8217;s shoulders.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Pedersen&#8217;s teammate Mathias Vacek is third overall at 14 seconds.</p>\n<p>Pedersen will wear the maglia rosa on Tuesday for stage 4 from Alberobello to Lecce when the Giro d&#8217;Italia resumes in Puglia after a day of travel from Albania to Italy on Monday.</p>\n<p>Pedersen now has 52 career victories, apparently making him the most successful  pro rider in the history of Danish cycling.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Having two victories and now back in the pink jersey is exactly what we wanted today. This was the plan this morning,&#8221; Pedersen explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to put a good pace on the long climb, to control it for ourselves and give me a chance to breathe there so I didn&#8217;t need to go over the limit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone from the team did a super amazing job on the climb and before. From the climb, it was about controlling as far as we could and then it would be a drag race. It was exactly as we wanted it with Ciccone and Vacek giving me an amazing lead out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Ciccone has ambitions somewhere else in the race but he was there to help me, that shows his character. He committed to the team and to helping me. It shows what we can do at Lidl-Trek. I can&#8217;t wait to get to the mountains and give something back to Cicco.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe sun was out in Valona for the 160km third stage, with riders facing a long loop into the Albania hills before a fast finish back in the holiday resort in the south of Albania.</p>\n<p>Valona is just across the Adriatic Sea from Puglia in southern Italy, where the riders headed post stage by plane for the first rest day/travel day of the 2025 Corsa Rosa.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç looked resplendent in magia rosa but the Slovenian was keen to let someone else take the leader&#8217;s jersey and all the extra responsibilities that come with it.</p>\n<p>Pedersen was the most likely candidate but the rest of the peloton sensed Rogliƒç&#8217;s desire and the attacks came fast and furious in the opening kilometres, as riders tried to join the right break of the day.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) made an early move and Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) sneaked into a split as the peloton lined out on the valley road south of Valona.</p>\n<p>After a high-speed 20 minutes, a break was finally allowed some freedom. Stage 2 winner Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers), Mark Donovan (Q36.5), Lorenzo Germani (Groupama-FDJ) and Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL) were there. Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta) and Dries De Bondt (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) set off in pursuit just before the peloton closed down other other surges and then eased up, closing down the road.</p>\n<p>The sextet had their chance, with Tarling the best placed rider in the GC at 1:34. The young Welsh rider became the virtual race leader but the peloton kept them under control.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe accepted their race leader responsibilities and led the peloton, with Jacopo Mosca (Lidl-Trek) often helping Gianni Moscon and Nico Denz with the work on the front. They pinned the gap to below 3:00.</p>\n<p>Tonelli won the intermediate sprint in Gjorm after 34km and the stage steadied. The late climb and chase to the finish would be the decisive moment of the day. A rush of adrenaline came mid-stage when a goal ran into the road and almost took out Dion Smith (Intermarche-Wanty). He used his bike skills to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Donovan was the first over the Shakelles climb after 65km as the breakaways shared the glory and the prizes. The terrain was now very barren and constantly rolling in the hills.</p>\n<p>De Bondt and the breakaways rolled through the Red Bull KM in Himar√´ with 88km raced and 71km to go but at least this time, the six, four and two bonus seconds would have little impact on the race.</p>\n<p>The country roads sparked several punctures, with Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) forced to take a teammate&#8217;s bike for a while but he was soon back into the peloton. De Bondt also suffered a puncture and so was dropped from the break near the Gjilek√´ intermediate sprint with 52km to race.</p>\n<p>The rolling roads had hurt many in the peloton and the break, with a number of sprinters forced to chase. It was a sign of things to come on the category 2, 10.5km long Qafa e Llogaras√´ climb.</p>\n<p>The Qafa e Llogaras√´ climbed high into the Albanian mountains, with a 9.6% section after three kilometres and then an average gradient of 7.4%.</p>\n<p>The climb began after 110km, with 50km to go. Pedersen was there and looked good but others were suffering. Lidl-Trek took control of the peloton with poise and clam, Daan Hoole leading the peloton at the start the Qafa e Llogaras√´ climb.</p>\n<p>The pace was soon high and hurting and Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was soon dropped from the peloton, as were others. The break also fell apart as the peloton closed the gap to less than a minute. Tarling was dropped after a second day in the spotlight and second impressive performance.</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) and Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) attacked from the peloton in a clever move to try to win the stage. They soon joined Hamilton and Tonelli at the front of the race with Germani just off the back and Donovan left behind.</p>\n<p>Hamilton was the last man from the original break to stay with Fortunato and Bilbao as they neared the summit. Behind Lidl-Trek continued to carefully pace the peloton, with Tom Pidcock playfully surging on the front to see the effects. Fortunato was first to the summit of the Qafa e Llogaras√´ ahead of Bilbao, to ensure he would pull on the Maglia Azzurra points jersey.</p>\n<p>The two were just 50 seconds ahead of the peloton, as the GC riders massed on the front for the descent. Only 50 or so riders were left in the peloton but Pedersen was there.</p>\n<p>The descent led down into the valley through the mist but the roads were wide and smooth. With 30km to go, Fortunato and Bilbao had a gap of 45 seconds but the peloton and especially Lidl-Trek were hunting them down on the road to Valona. On the fast valley run to the finish, some sprinters managed to get back on, including Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizane), swelling the front group to 80 or so riders.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek eventually swept up Fortunato and Bilbao with 18km to race and suddenly the sprint was on. Pedersen would need to finish in the top three to take back the pink jersey thanks to the time bonuses.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious took control of the peloton in the final ten kilometres, leading along the coast road as if racing Milan-San Remo. All the GC teams wanted to keep their leaders safe until the final three kilometres, where times would be taken in case of a subsequent crash.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe also rode carefully to keep Rogliƒç upfront and safe on the single lane seafront road. There was a fight for position and the best wheels but without any excess risk or danger. The worst moment was when a dog ran across the road just in front of the riders.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek led out the sprint with Giulio Ciccone leading the way, a climber and the team&#8217;s GC leader also committed to Pedersen&#8217;s success. Mathias Vacek was behind him with everyone else fighting for the wheels in their slipstream.</p>\n<p>Vacek gradually wound-up his leadout, his hands wider on the levers. Nobody went early and so Pedersen hit out from the front, convinced of his speed and seeing victory and the maglia rosa ahead of him.</p>\n<p>Strong came up late but Pedersen was in charge, just as he and Lidl-Trek had been all day. Their reward was a second stage win and the maglia rosa back on Pedersen&#8217;s shoulders.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race will start on 9 May in Durr√´s and finish on 1 June in Rome. There are two individual time trial stages and 3 stages longer than 200 km. Twenty-three teams will take part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited. They will be joined by five UCI ProTeams: one of the two highest ranked UCI ProTeams in 2024, along with four teams selected by RCS Sport, the organisers of the Tour.</p>\n<p>Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) used his time trial skills and talents to win the stage 2 time of the Giro d&#8217;Italia around Tirana, as Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) produced the ride of the day to finish a close second and so snatch the maglia rosa from stage 1 winner Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek). </p>\n<p>Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) endured a bad day and so failed to get even close to Pedersen, as the Corsa Rosa produced another suprise.</p>\n<p>21-year-old Tarling set a time of 16:07 for the 13.7km city centre course, at an average speed of 51.003km/h. He dived through the many corners with control, powered up the gradual climb to Sauk and then took a few risks and stayed aero on the fast descent to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç matched Tarling&#8217;s time checks and fought a rising head wind in the final kilometre to finish just one second slower.</p>\n<p>Australia&#8217;s Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was third on the stage at three seconds, with US national time trial champion Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) eighth at 13 seconds.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç beat Pedersen by 11 seconds in the time trial and so took the maglia rosa by a single second. He also gained time on all his GC rivals in an ominous sign for this year&#8217;s race. </p>\n<p>Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) lost 16 seconds to the veteran Slovenian, Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Racing) lost 27 seconds and Canada&#8217;s Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) 28 seconds.</p>\n<p>Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) shipped 25 seconds to Rogliƒç, Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) lost a significantly more 42 seconds, while Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) lost 48 seconds. Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) risked crashing on mid-course corner but fought on to lose 37 seconds to Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>Pedersen started last in the maglia rosa, in a virtual pursuit match with Van Aert and Rogliƒç for the new maglia rosa. Van Aert soon faded but Pedersen refused to give up hope of staying in pink. At the line Pedersen was timed at just 11 seconds down on Rogliƒç but that was a second much and so he lost the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Tarling made history as the youngest ever Giro time trial winner.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe it, I&#8217;m so happy,&#8221; Tarling said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The wait wasn&#8217;t nice, I don&#8217;t want to do it again. It was a long day for 13km. I was afraid of all the favourites, Wout, Mads and Primoz really scared me, it was a stressful day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tarling was happier with what he could control: his own performance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We did the first part smoothly and in control, with the climb nice and hard. The last section was harder than we thought in the recon ride, so I made sure to really hurt there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nNiklas M√§rkl of Team Picnic PostNL was the first rider down the start ramp in central Tirana, but Britain&#8217;s Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep) was soon the fastest, with a time of 16:21 for the flat and fast 13.7km course.</p>\n<p>European time trial champion Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease a Bike) was perfectly suited to the course and powered home to set a new best time of 16:13. That put him in the hot seat, but the Italian was never confident he had set a fast enough time.</p>\n<p>Soon after Luke Plapp (Jayco Alula) crashed at speed during his ride, as riders took risks on the city centre corners. The Australian national champion slipped out on a tight turn and slid along the road in his green and gold skinsuit. Plapp shook his right wrist after getting a new bike and starting to ride again. He rode carefully to the finish and set a time of 19:54.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) crashed during stage 1 but did not hold back in the time trial. The Australian took risks on some fast corners and put down huge controlled power on the flat roads. He was fastest at the first intermediate with a five second advantage on Affini. He set a time of 16:10, ending three seconds faster than Affini.</p>\n<p>Tarling wore the iconic British time trial champion&#8217;s jersey for his ride. He started fast and determined, staying low over his Pinarello time trial bike.  He was immediately seven seconds faster than Vine at the first time check after just five kilometres. He continued to increase his lead with every pedal stroke on the flat road, lost a few seconds on the climb to Sauk and the official time check, but then flew back down to central Tirana. He gained precious seconds all the way to the line to set a time of 16:07, three seconds faster than Vine.</p>\n<p>Ayuso started earlier than his GC rivals after finishing at the back of the lead group on stage 1. UAE teammate and US national time trial champion Brandon McNulty was off soon after him, with Adam Yates off one behind the American.</p>\n<p>Ayuso lost his aero bidon after hitting a bump in the road and also lost five seconds to Tarling in the opening five kilometres. The Spaniard managed to pull back two seconds on the gradual climb to Sauk but was timed three seconds slower. McNulty was timed two seconds slower than Vine at the check but was one second faster than Tarling. They were all close, and the battle for the stage victory was entwined with the GC battle for every second.</p>\n<p>Ayuso did not take huge risks on the descent to the finish but also had to ride into a growing headwind. They cost him vital seconds and he stopped the clock in 16:24 That was 17 seconds slower than Tarling, most of it lost in the final five kilometres.</p>\n<p>McNulty also lost time into the headwind. He set a time of 16:20, a significant 13 seconds slower than Tarling. Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) went closer despite the wind but was six seconds slower than Tarling.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç managed to limit his losses in the opening kilometres and then powered up the gradual climb to Sauk, suddenly showing he was a contender for the stage victory and the maglia rosa. He matched the same 10:08 time at the summit and then raced down the descent in his aero tuck.</p>\n<p>The virtual time check showed Rogliƒç on the same time as Tarling, and he raced to the finish line as the seconds ticked down. He was less than 30 metres from the line when the clock turned red to indicate that Tarling was faster by a single second. Rogliƒç&#8217;s reward would come a little later.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, everyone else riding after Rogliƒç, faced a battle to limit their time losses. Tiberi, Ciccone, and Carapaz were suddenly on the back foot after losing a chunk of time. Carapaz perhaps considered him lucky after saving a double bike flip on the same corner where Plapp crashed.</p>\n<p>In the final moments of the time trial, Pedersen raced Van Aert, and both knew they were racing Rogliƒç for the maglia rosa.</p>\n<p>Van Aert soon realised his moment was done after losing 28 seconds to Tarling at the time split. He finished 39 seconds slower than Tarling.</p>\n<p>Pedersen took some risks on the early flat roads, knowing he needed to gain time for the climb and headwind finish. He was clocked at 10 seconds slower than Rogliƒç at the Saul time split after eight kilometres of the 13.7km course.</p>\n<p>It was close race to the line. Pedersen tried to sprint to the line just as he did so successfully on Friday. However, this time, Rogliƒç was faster by just two seconds and so pulled on the maglia rosa, two years after winning in Rome at the 2023 Giro.</p>\n<p>On Sunday he will surely be happy to let it go to a breakaway, or even to Pedersen, who could take it back thanks to the bonus seconds awarded at the finish if he can fight for the stage victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=13&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It&#8217;s not a given to win when he&#8217;s in the group, and you have to handle that with respect and a bit of fear as well.

The attacks came immediately from VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®, and after a few tries, a five-man escape succeeded in getting away.</p>\n<p>In the move were Alessandro Verre (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Alessandro Tonelli (Polti-VisitMalta), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike weren&#8217;t giving the quintet much room to build up hopes of contesting the stage win, so the breakaway instead fought for the mountains classification with one category 2 and two category 3 ascents in the second half of the stage.</p>\n<p>A small crash involving Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG) and Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL) only briefly disrupted the chase with 90km to go.</p>\n<p>Tonelli led the breakaway across the first intermediate sprint in Pap√´r and again in Elbasan before the breakaway made their way up the first climb, the 12.9 kilometre Gracen.</p>\n<p>The breakaway had only 1:20 in hand as they began the ascent. When Tonelli attacked ahead of the final 2km of the climb, the pace was too much for Van der Hoorn, and he wisely dropped back to the peloton. The remaining four riders engaged in a battle so fierce it looked as if they were sprinting for the stage win in the run-up to the summit.</p>\n<p>In the final metres, Tarozzi attacked but was quickly marked and passed by Moniquet, who timed his surge perfectly and held off Verre at the summit to put in his bid for the blue climber&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>Their advantage on the peloton was 1:26 at the top and fell rapidly once the peloton followed and started on the descent.

The peloton also proceeded with caution, allowing Verre to stretch his lead to almost one minute.

It runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland. The competition began in 1947, to coincide with the 50-year anniversary of Swiss Cycling. The course of the race usually heads northwards towards the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges of western Switzerland. The race traditionally starts with an individual time trial prologue and ends with an individual time-trial in hilly terrains, often in Lausanne. The final time-trial traditionally starts in the stadium north of Lausanne, goes downhill southwards to Lake L√©man (Lake Geneva), and makes its way back uphill to the stadium again. The winner and several of the top-ten finishers are usually excellent time trialists.</p>\n<p>World and Olympic time trial champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) won the stage 5 time trial at the Tour de Romandie on Sunday, as Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) powered to second place to win the overall.</p>\n<p>Almeida started the day three seconds down on stage 4 winner and race leader Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), and successfully overhauled the Frenchman, beating him by 30 seconds to seize the GC victory. Martinez finished 13th on the stage, enough to finish second overall.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) finished fourth on the stage to move onto the podium and finish third as Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana), previously second, shipped a lot of time in the TT and slipped down the rankings.</p>\n<p>Third on the day went to Alberto Bettiol (XDS Astana), who set an impressive time early on and was only beaten by the GC riders.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, I feel very happy. The goal was to win the race,&#8221; Almeida said. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t win a stage, but we were always in the front, and that&#8217;s what matters. I&#8217;m super happy for the overall win. I need to thank the whole team; they did a really good job, and we can be proud of it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What counts is the last day, right? So I think it was the right day [to take the lead]. To be honest, I was struggling the whole week; I was never feeling 100 per cent, but I gave my best, and I never gave up. Sometimes it&#8217;s all about your mindset.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Though only 17km in length, the final time trial made for some significant moves in the top 10, not just Almeida grabbing the win, but Evenepoel&#8217;s win saw him climb up to fifth overall and cap off a mixed week with a victory after dropping back on the Queen stage on Saturday.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was quite a unique course, I&#8217;d say, with a technical start and then a long straight line towards the climb and then a long time on the power to come back, but I think I did an almost perfect time trial, the maximum I could do today, so I&#8217;m happy to come back with a victory today,&#8221; Evenepoel said at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I came here with quite normal ambitions, nothing crazy, I knew I was coming to this race with some up and down form, so I didn&#8217;t have big ambitions. I was mainly focusing on today&#8217;s stage.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 5&#8217;s final time trial saw the riders take on a 17.1km course around Geneva, largely flat but with one steady rise in the second half.</p>\n<p>Of the early starters, it was Danish TT specialist Johan Price-Pejtersen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) who recorded the initial fastest time, setting a benchmark time of 21:11, though with such strong time trialists amongst the top GC riders, that time was always expected to fall.</p>\n<p>It was a surprising name that first knocked Price-Pejtersen off the hot seat when Thibault Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) took four seconds off the Dane, but that time didn&#8217;t last long either, as Alberto Bettiol (XDS Astana) soon knocked a big 15 seconds off the best time.</p>\n<p>Bettiol&#8217;s strong time stood for most of the afternoon, with only Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) coming close, but that changed when the GC riders started to finish.</p>\n<p>After feeling slightly off the pace in the mountains, time trial world champion Evenepoel was back at his best on his TT bike, knocking 18 seconds off of Bettiol&#8217;s time to grab the lead and set a time that no one else could touch.</p>\n<p>With Evenepoel having the stage win in the bag, the final times were just about the GC, with Almeida clocking a time 11 seconds down on the Belgian but enough to take the overall victory from Martinez, who put in a strong effort in the discipline to hold onto second.</p>\n<p>Martinez will also take home the best young rider&#8217;s jersey, whilst Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) wins the mountains classification, and the points jersey goes to Jay Vine.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland. The competition began in 1947, to coincide with the 50-year anniversary of Swiss Cycling. The course of the race usually heads northwards towards the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges of western Switzerland. The race traditionally starts with an individual time trial prologue and ends with an individual time-trial in hilly terrains, often in Lausanne. The final time-trial traditionally starts in the stadium north of Lausanne, goes downhill southwards to Lake L√©man (Lake Geneva), and makes its way back uphill to the stadium again. The winner and several of the top-ten finishers are usually excellent time trialists.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) launched a perfectly-timed attack in the final kilometre to win stage 3 of the Tour de Romandie, claiming his third win of the season and first WorldTour victory for more than two years.</p>\n<p>Movistar had led things out on the uphill finale in Cossonay, with Iv√°n Romeo doing the work for Javier Romo. However, when the Spanish pair stalled and Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) didn&#8217;t kick on after looking like he might, Vine accelerated violently and found separation.</p>\n<p>There was a grimace on the Australian&#8217;s face, but he held strong all the way to the line to win solo, with a narrow gap of just two seconds at the line from Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), who won the sprint for second. Vine&#8217;s teammate Jo√£o Almeida finished third.</p>\n<p>Pre-stage race leader Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) finished in the main group up the gruelling finish to maintain his lead heading into the final two stages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first two hours were really, really hard. It felt like I was being motor paced, but after that [second] climb, the gap was being reduced to Stefan [K√ºng] and I thought &#8216;OK, I&#8217;ve got to be up here in this group to minimise time gaps, so I might as well see what I can do and have a crack,&#8221; said Vine, describing his third stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a pause in the group, and I mean I&#8217;m not very bright, so I was like &#8216;Is it 1km to the top of the climb, or 1km to the finish&#8217;, but that was probably my bullet and my moment to go, and I took it. Once I rounded the corner, I knew it started to flatten off and go downhill again, so I was pretty safe by them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vine moved up to sixth on GC thanks to his stage win, with him and Almeida set to be main players for the overall in the final two weekend stages. With the Giro starting a week today, the Australian looks to be coming into peak form just more than a year after his horror crash in Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty incredible, it&#8217;s been a long road back to recovery from my neck last year and hopefully I&#8217;ll be starting my second Giro in a couple of days&#8217; time. Three wins so far this year and my first WorldTour win in a long time, so I&#8217;m really happy and I know my son and wife are watching at home,&#8221; said Vine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all to play for tomorrow and on the time trial.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de Romandie continued on stage 3 with another undulating route, starting and finishing in Cossonay, with 183.1km of racing in front of the 119 remaining riders.</p>\n<p>With more tough terrain on offer from the flag drop four strong riders initially gained an advantage and tried to form the break, Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), Huub Artz (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek) and Tobias Bayer (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Bayer struggled and got dropped under 10km into the day, only to be joined by the current King of the Mountains leader Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).

It runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland. The competition began in 1947, to coincide with the 50-year anniversary of Swiss Cycling. The course of the race usually heads northwards towards the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges of western Switzerland. The race traditionally starts with an individual time trial prologue and ends with an individual time-trial in hilly terrains, often in Lausanne. The final time-trial traditionally starts in the stadium north of Lausanne, goes downhill southwards to Lake L√©man (Lake Geneva), and makes its way back uphill to the stadium again. The winner and several of the top-ten finishers are usually excellent time trialists.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) launched a perfectly-timed attack in the final kilometre to win stage 3 of the Tour de Romandie, claiming his third win of the season and first WorldTour victory for more than two years.</p>\n<p>Movistar had led things out on the uphill finale in Cossonay, with Iv√°n Romeo doing the work for Javier Romo. However, when the Spanish pair stalled and Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) didn&#8217;t kick on after looking like he might, Vine accelerated violently and found separation.</p>\n<p>There was a grimace on the Australian&#8217;s face, but he held strong all the way to the line to win solo, with a narrow gap of just two seconds at the line from Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious), who won the sprint for second. Vine&#8217;s teammate Jo√£o Almeida finished third.</p>\n<p>Pre-stage race leader Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) finished in the main group up the gruelling finish to maintain his lead heading into the final two stages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first two hours were really, really hard. It felt like I was being motor paced, but after that [second] climb, the gap was being reduced to Stefan [K√ºng] and I thought &#8216;OK, I&#8217;ve got to be up here in this group to minimise time gaps, so I might as well see what I can do and have a crack,&#8221; said Vine, describing his third stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a pause in the group, and I mean I&#8217;m not very bright, so I was like &#8216;Is it 1km to the top of the climb, or 1km to the finish&#8217;, but that was probably my bullet and my moment to go, and I took it. Once I rounded the corner, I knew it started to flatten off and go downhill again, so I was pretty safe by them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Vine moved up to sixth on GC thanks to his stage win, with him and Almeida set to be main players for the overall in the final two weekend stages. With the Giro starting a week today, the Australian looks to be coming into peak form just more than a year after his horror crash in Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty incredible, it&#8217;s been a long road back to recovery from my neck last year and hopefully I&#8217;ll be starting my second Giro in a couple of days&#8217; time. Three wins so far this year and my first WorldTour win in a long time, so I&#8217;m really happy and I know my son and wife are watching at home,&#8221; said Vine.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all to play for tomorrow and on the time trial.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour de Romandie continued on stage 3 with another undulating route, starting and finishing in Cossonay, with 183.1km of racing in front of the 119 remaining riders.</p>\n<p>With more tough terrain on offer from the flag drop four strong riders initially gained an advantage and tried to form the break, Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), Huub Artz (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek) and Tobias Bayer (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Bayer struggled and got dropped under 10km into the day, only to be joined by the current King of the Mountains leader Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). They tried to stay ahead but gave up the ghost and were reabsorbed by the peloton 160km from the finish.</p>\n<p>With the break of three formed for the day, the peloton settled back into a controlling rhythm and allowed the trio to build a lead of almost six minutes.</p>\n<p>The look of stage 3 remained the same for much of the middle of the race, although the lead was reduced to 2:50 with 55km remaining.</p>\n<p>Perhaps with that in mind, on the longest categorised climb of the day, the Col du Mollendruz, K√ºng set off on his own, leading his two fellow escapees to chase.

Today was a hard race because Soudal-QuickStep started to pull from the start, and the peloton waited for Remco to attack on the last climb, then we remained as 20 riders,&#8221; said Fortunato post-race, before explaining his all-or-nothing approach in the final.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wanted to take seconds or a minute for the GC [on the Evenepoel group]. In the last kilometre and I thought &#8216;OK, I&#8217;ll win or be the last in the group&#8217;, but in the final, I won the stage ‚Äì I&#8217;m very happy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This season for XDS Astana is crucial, so we have to win points in all the races, but now I want to finish this Romandie and go to the Giro to win a stage.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a prologue and reduced sprint on stage 1 of the Tour de Romandie, the second road stage brought with it the hardest say or racing so far in Western Switzerland, with four categorised climbs and just under 3,000m of elevation in store.</p>\n<p>Racing started and finished in La Grande B√©roche, beside Lake Neuch√¢tel, and the climbing was on right from the flag drop. The peloton immediately hit the foot of the 7km Col de la Tourne, with the Mauborget climb not long after.</p>\n<p>Several riders launched attacks to try and get ahead, notably Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) and Archie Ryan (EF Education-EasyPost); however, they were brought back and countered by the likes of Ryan&#8217;s teammate, Hugh Carthy and current King of the Mountains, Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p>The latter pair were joined by Welay Hagos Berhe (Jayco AlUla), Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek) and Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) to form a five-man breakaway for the day. Their gap was built to just more than two minutes, but they were kept closely controlled by Soudal-QuickStep.</p>\n<p>With 73km to go, the break&#8217;s lead dipped below a minute and provoked Carthy into another attack up Les Grattes (5.8km at 5.9%), with only Bernard able to follow.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel&#8217;s team continued to work on the front of the peloton, suggesting that the Belgian was gearing up for an attack at some point. Their strong tempo caused both pre-stage leader Brennan and second-placed Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) to drop midway through the day.</p>\n<p>Having re-established a 2:00 lead on the peloton at the bottom of the climb, only Carthy and Bernard were left out in front, as Zwiehoff, Berhe and Garc√≠a Pierna were swept up.</p>\n<p>With 50km to go, racing hit the final categorised climb of the day to Chaumont, with Carthy leaving Bernard behind on the stinging 3.2km ascent that averaged an 11.4% gradient. The Brit had only 50 seconds of an advantage at the foot.</p>\n<p>As Evenepoel&#8217;s teammates finished their work, UAE Team Emirates-XRG took over on the front through Jay Vine, with Jo√£o Almeida close behind him.</p>\n<p>Carthy crested the final climb alone, but with Evenepoel increasing the pace over the top and bringing many of the favourites with him. This ended Carthy&#8217;s day in front, with almost 20 of the main climbers catching him.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Juan Pedro L√≥pez (Lidl-Trek) and Vine found separation from the uncooperative bunch and kicked on to gain a lead of 20 seconds. They were pulled back as the stage entered its mainly flat final 30km.</p>\n<p>With the group not working, Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) launched the first move to try and anticipate in the final, with L√≥pez and Evenepoel&#8217;s teammate Junior Lecerf joining him. A second attempt to bridge was completed by Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) and Lennert Van Eetvelt, who quickly made it a group of five in the lead.</p>\n<p>As the group of favourites behind still couldn&#8217;t get a chase going, they fell over a minute behind the quintet in the lead with 5km still to go, meaning it was definitely going to come down to the leading five.</p>\n<p>Approaching the final kilometre, Lecerf, Van Eetvelt, Baudin and L√≥pez all started pulling off and slowing the pace down, not wanting to drag the other four into the finishing sprint. However, Fortunato wasted no time hesitating, and after almost by accident finding himself off the front, he decided to go all in.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt initially chased for a moment but then stopped, allowing the Italian to gain all the gap for the final 800 metres. When the sprint was eventually launched behind, Baudin was the quickest, but Fortunato was already celebrating in front of him.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel led the group of main favourites home in the sprint, meaning he&#8217;ll start stage 3 in sixth, 52 seconds behind Baudin&#8217;s lead. Tomorrow&#8217;s stage is a similarly undulating test, before the Queen stage to Thyon 2000 on Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In the last kilometre and I thought &#8216;OK, I&#8217;ll win or be the last in the group&#8217;, but in the final, I won the stage ‚Äì I&#8217;m very happy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This season for XDS Astana is crucial, so we have to win points in all the races, but now I want to finish this Romandie and go to the Giro to win a stage.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a prologue and reduced sprint on stage 1 of the Tour de Romandie, the second road stage brought with it the hardest say or racing so far in Western Switzerland, with four categorised climbs and just under 3,000m of elevation in store.</p>\n<p>Racing started and finished in La Grande B√©roche, beside Lake Neuch√¢tel, and the climbing was on right from the flag drop. The peloton immediately hit the foot of the 7km Col de la Tourne, with the Mauborget climb not long after.</p>\n<p>Several riders launched attacks to try and get ahead, notably Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) and Archie Ryan (EF Education-EasyPost); however, they were brought back and countered by the likes of Ryan&#8217;s teammate, Hugh Carthy and current King of the Mountains, Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p>The latter pair were joined by Welay Hagos Berhe (Jayco AlUla), Julien Bernard (Lidl-Trek) and Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) to form a five-man breakaway for the day. Their gap was built to just more than two minutes, but they were kept closely controlled by Soudal-QuickStep.</p>\n<p>With 73km to go, the break&#8217;s lead dipped below a minute and provoked Carthy into another attack up Les Grattes (5.8km at 5.9%), with only Bernard able to follow.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel&#8217;s team continued to work on the front of the peloton, suggesting that the Belgian was gearing up for an attack at some point. Their strong tempo caused both pre-stage leader Brennan and second-placed Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) to drop midway through the day.</p>\n<p>Having re-established a 2:00 lead on the peloton at the bottom of the climb, only Carthy and Bernard were left out in front, as Zwiehoff, Berhe and Garc√≠a Pierna were swept up.</p>\n<p>With 50km to go, racing hit the final categorised climb of the day to Chaumont, with Carthy leaving Bernard behind on the stinging 3.2km ascent that averaged an 11.4% gradient. The Brit had only 50 seconds of an advantage at the foot.</p>\n<p>As Evenepoel&#8217;s teammates finished their work, UAE Team Emirates-XRG took over on the front through Jay Vine, with Jo√£o Almeida close behind him.</p>\n<p>Carthy crested the final climb alone, but with Evenepoel increasing the pace over the top and bringing many of the favourites with him. This ended Carthy&#8217;s day in front, with almost 20 of the main climbers catching him.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Juan Pedro L√≥pez (Lidl-Trek) and Vine found separation from the uncooperative bunch and kicked on to gain a lead of 20 seconds. They were pulled back as the stage entered its mainly flat final 30km.</p>\n<p>With the group not working, Alex Baudin (EF Education-EasyPost) launched the first move to try and anticipate in the final, with L√≥pez and Evenepoel&#8217;s teammate Junior Lecerf joining him. A second attempt to bridge was completed by Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS Astana) and Lennert Van Eetvelt, who quickly made it a group of five in the lead.</p>\n<p>As the group of favourites behind still couldn&#8217;t get a chase going, they fell over a minute behind the quintet in the lead with 5km still to go, meaning it was definitely going to come down to the leading five.</p>\n<p>Approaching the final kilometre, Lecerf, Van Eetvelt, Baudin and L√≥pez all started pulling off and slowing the pace down, not wanting to drag the other four into the finishing sprint. However, Fortunato wasted no time hesitating, and after almost by accident finding himself off the front, he decided to go all in.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt initially chased for a moment but then stopped, allowing the Italian to gain all the gap for the final 800 metres. When the sprint was eventually launched behind, Baudin was the quickest, but Fortunato was already celebrating in front of him.</p>\n<p>Evenepoel led the group of main favourites home in the sprint, meaning he&#8217;ll start stage 3 in sixth, 52 seconds behind Baudin&#8217;s lead. Tomorrow&#8217;s stage is a similarly undulating test, before the Queen stage to Thyon 2000 on Saturday.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland. The competition began in 1947, to coincide with the 50-year anniversary of Swiss Cycling. The course of the race usually heads northwards towards the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges of western Switzerland. The race traditionally starts with an individual time trial prologue and ends with an individual time-trial in hilly terrains, often in Lausanne. The final time-trial traditionally starts in the stadium north of Lausanne, goes downhill southwards to Lake L√©man (Lake Geneva), and makes its way back uphill to the stadium again. The winner and several of the top-ten finishers are usually excellent time trialists.</p>\n<p>Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) sped to victory on stage 1 of the Tour de Romandie, coming out on top in a mass sprint finish on the uphill run to the line in Fribourg.</p>\n<p>The British neo-pro scored the third WorldTour win of his career with ease, jumping from second wheel inside the closing 200 metres and crossing the line several bike lengths ahead of second place.</p>\n<p>Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) took second place some way behind Brennan, while Artem Shmidt (Ineos Grenadiers) rounded out the podium.</p>\n<p>Brennan, who finished the prologue in 15th place, seven seconds down on stage winner Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers), now vaults into the race lead thanks to the 10-second time bonus for the stage 1 victory.</p>\n<p>He now leads his countryman by three seconds heading into stage 2. Ivo Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) lies third overall with the same time as Watson, while Shmidt moves up to fourth overall at five seconds down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think once we got over the climb, we knew we had good legs, and we could pull towards the end. I think the guys did a really nice position pulling me into the early parts and keeping me out of trouble,&#8221; Brennan said after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coming into the final, I managed to follow some wheels. It was quite chaotic and a pretty tricky finish. We had to use a lot of legs, but we got it in the end.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was, as I say, very chaotic, and when you really are fighting to find that wheel, it‚Äôs a pretty big challenge. But I managed to find it, and I actually got a little bit further ahead than I maybe thought I would, but in those moments, you have to react to the situation and keep going</p>\n<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs special. Again, coming into this race, we really wanted to achieve something and to finally come out with it, me and the team are so happy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Winning another stage would always be nice and hopefully we‚Äôll support J√∏rgen [Nordhagen] into the GC battle on the hilly stages. I am really looking forward to the next few days.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first road stage of the 2025 Tour de Romandie would take the riders on the first major climbs of the race, bringing them on a 194km ride from M√ºnchenstein to Fribourg.</p>\n<p>The stage took in four classified climbs, including the second-category Col de Pontins (4.5km at 7.2%), though the final 60km was run over largely flat roads, besides the uphill kick to the finish.</p>\n<p>Attacks from the start saw the break form early on as Silvan Dillier (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Ben Zwiehoff (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), and Gerben Kuypers (Intermarch√©-Wanty) jumped off the front. Shortly afterwards, a counter by Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier (Lidl-Trek) and Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ) brought the number of riders out front to five.</p>\n<p>As Ineos Grenadiers, Picnic-PostNL, and Visma-Lease A Bike settled in to lead the pacemaking at the head of the peloton, the breakaway built their lead up over four minutes.</p>\n<p>Kuypers led Zwiehoff over the day‚Äôs first climb, the third-category test at Grindel (2.3km at 6.5%) after 28km. He‚Äôd do the same at Mont-Crosin (2.3km at 7.2%) 63km later to build a four-point (10 to 6) lead at the top of the mountain classification.</p>\n<p>The hardest climb of the day, the Col de Pontins, would follow just past the midway mark of the stage, after 102km, and there it was Zwiehoff who led the way.</p>\n<p>Dillier was dropped on the way up, while Zwiehoff led solo at the front with Ghebreigzabhier and Kuypers following. The order across the top shifted the mountain classification rankings 16 to 14 in Zwiehoff‚Äôs favour, with one climb left on the stage.</p>\n<p>On that third-category climb of Chaumont (3km at 11.9%) which peaked with 76km to go, Zwiehoff once again went solo at the front. The German put 30 seconds into Kuypers on the way up, extending his mountain classification lead with 26 points to the Belgian‚Äôs 20.</p>\n<p>Further back, the remainder of the breakaway riders lay over two minutes down, with the peloton at 3:20 off the lead, fast hoovering up the dropped riders. Kuypers would rejoin Zwiehoff on the flat following the descent, racing on despite the peloton closing in.</p>\n<p>The pair raced into the final 60km of the day with a 1:30 advantage on the Ineos- and Visma-led peloton.</p>\n<p>That gap wouldn‚Äôt last, however, as the pace behind went up as the finish line neared. At 30km to go, just 40 seconds separated the groups, though that margin was swept away swiftly afterwards as Kuypers and Zwiehoff were brought back 25km from home.</p>\n<p>From there, a sprint for the finish was assured as the teams hoping to contest the final flowed to the front. It was Soudal-QuickStep who took charge heading into Fribourg, leading the way down the 2km descent heading into the closing kilometres before the final run to the line.</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers were next to take over, lining up with a concerted team effort in the final 2km. No single team controlled the situation in the final kilometre, however, although the red jerseys of Ineos and Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels were present.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was a man in yellow, Brennan, who profited from the lead outs. He surfed an Ark√©a wheel before launching into the wind. The 19-year-old had few rivals in the dash to the line as his initial acceleration separated himself from the rest with ease.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It runs through the Romandie region, or French-speaking part of Switzerland. The competition began in 1947, to coincide with the 50-year anniversary of Swiss Cycling. The course of the race usually heads northwards towards the Jura mountains and Alpine mountain ranges of western Switzerland. The race traditionally starts with an individual time trial prologue and ends with an individual time-trial in hilly terrains, often in Lausanne. The final time-trial traditionally starts in the stadium north of Lausanne, goes downhill southwards to Lake L√©man (Lake Geneva), and makes its way back uphill to the stadium again. The winner and several of the top-ten finishers are usually excellent time trialists.</p>\n<p>Sam Watson (Ineos Grenadiers) powered to the first WorldTour victory of his career in the 3.4km opening prologue at the Tour de Romandie, narrowly pipping Ivo Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to the win by less than a second with a time of 4:33 in Saint-Imier.</p>\n<p>The near-four-minute effort fit perfectly into Oliveira&#8217;s wheelhouse, as one of the top individual pursuit riders in track cycling. He had survived challenges from Olympic and world time trial champion Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) and Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ), and looked set for victory, until he was left with his head in his hands on the hot seat after Watson bettered his time.</p>\n<p>Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar) finished third, after leading much of the early phases until Oliveira knocked him off of top spot with a time three seconds faster.</p>\n<p>Watson was announced as a late addition to Ineos&#8217; starting roster, only told he would be racing in Romandie yesterday, having not raced since the cobbled Classics, but he&#8217;s now managed to claim the biggest win of his career so far.</p>\n<p>With such a short distance in the prologue, the GC favourites weren&#8217;t separated by much at the finish, Evenepoel at five seconds down in eighth, Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) one second further, and Watson&#8217;s teammate Carlos Rodr√≠guez on a fifteen-second deficit.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yesterday I was out training in Andorra one and a half hours from home and I get a call from the team saying, &#8216;Get to the airport as soon as you can, because you&#8217;re racing Romandie&#8217;, and then here I am with a victory, so it&#8217;s pretty special,&#8221; said a delighted Watson at the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;All I felt was paint, to be honest, and I crossed the line, and I didn&#8217;t know I was leading until the first interview. It was quite a nice surprise. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s really set in yet but yeah, fuck, to say I&#8217;ve won my first WorldTour race with Ineos as well, my first win with them, is a bit of a dream.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For sure, it definitely gives me some confidence, you know, and we can really get into the next days, on paper, that suit me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How It Unfolded</strong><br />\nAction at the 78th Tour de Romandie kicked off with its typical prologue opener in Saint-Imier in the northwest corner of Switzerland, with Lennart Van Eetvelt (Lotto) the first rider to roll off the start ramp for the 3.44km race against the clock.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt held an early lead with a time of 4:45 at the finish, until Alex Baudin knocked him off the top spot by a couple of tenths. That too was very short-lived, though, as reigning under-23 time trial world champion Iv√°n Romeo came through the line nine seconds quicker.</p>\n<p>Several riders filled that nine-second gap, with the short distance allowing sprinters, GC riders and TT specialists all to contest the victory. Last year&#8217;s Tour de Romandie prologue winner, Maikel Zijlaard (Tudor), came very close to repeating his feat, only two-tenths of a second slower than Romeo at the finish.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG had several riders finish close to the lead with their potential GC hopes, Jo√£o Almeida and Jay Vine, both finishing two seconds down on the Spaniard. However, it was instead their in-form teammate Ivo Oliveira who bettered Romeo&#8217;s time with a 4:33.</p>\n<p>One of the big questions for the day was whether riders opted to use their road bike, and utilise the better handling on a short, somewhat technical course, or to maximise their aerodynamic gain with the time trial machine. Oliveira did the latter to overtake Romeo&#8217;s time, who&#8217;d gone with the former.</p>\n<p>World and Olympic time trial champion Evenepoel exploded off the start ramp, showing his intentions of chasing the victory, however, he clearly took fewer risks in the corners and finished marginally 4 seconds down on Olivera&#8217;s time in fifth.</p>\n<p>Stefan K√ºng (Soudal-QuickStep) was similarly unable to better the Portuguese rider&#8217;s time, with the short distance not exactly playing into his strengths. He finished three seconds slower.</p>\n<p>Oliveira looked set for victory, having survived several of the pre-stage favourites, until he was left devastated by a stunning ride from Ineos Grenadiers&#8217; Watson, who went less than three-tenths of a second quicker.</p>\n<p>Only 19 riders were left to come after Watson, with former Romandie prologue winner from 2023, Josef ƒåern√Ω (Soudal-QuickStep), and 20-year-old star Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) looking the most likely contenders.</p>\n<p>However, even they couldn&#8217;t match the 45.6kph average speed that Watson had managed on the technical course, with Christen down in tenth and the victory being confirmed for the young Brit.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=00&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=12&#038;y=2025&#038;s=00&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1962, it was named Giro del Trentino (English: Tour of Trentino) until 2016, and run over four stages in the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol region of Italy. In 2015, the race merged with the nearby one-day race Trofeo Melinda, and the 2015 edition was called the Giro del Trentino Melinda. In 2017, the event was renamed Tour of the Alps, as it addresses the entire Euroregion of Tyrol‚ÄìSouth Tyrol‚ÄìTrentino, formed by three different regional authorities in two countries: the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. It should not be confused with the similarly named Giro al Sas di Trento, an annual road running competition in the city of Trento. Since its rebranding, the race is run mid-to-late April over five stages, as a 2.HC event of the UCI Europe Tour, the level beneath the UCI World Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Michael Storer (Tudor) produced another stunning performance to claim overall victory at the Tour of the Alps on stage 5, launching an attack out of the GC group 34km from the finish and dropping overnight leader Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) to wrest back the green jersey he ceded one day prior.</p>\n<p>Arensman, who started the day with an 11-second lead on Storer, tried to follow the Australian on the penultimate climb, but after a full gas lead-out by Tudor and a massive effort by Florian Stork, he was quickly a minute behind when Storer launched his move.</p>\n<p>Storer had the added help of Lukas Eriksson to pace him to the foot of the final climb, having made it into a large 15-man early breakaway, who played a key part in extending his lead to more than a minute over Arensman at the finish line to confirm the GC win.</p>\n<p>Further up the road, two men who were also part of the early move, Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale&#8217;s Paul Seixas and Nicolas Prodhomme, proved to be the strongest of the 15 escapees and attacked away on the final ascent to Stronach with a 1:30 lead over the charging Storer.</p>\n<p>The French pair rode into the Lienz finish in tandem, with a first pro win on offer for both of them. However, it was the loyal 28-year-old domestique Prodhomme who crossed the line first and took that maiden victory in a great 1-2 with the 18-year-old super talent Seixas.</p>\n<p>Storer crossed the finish line 1:20 behind the French duo after dominating the remainder of the GC field, with Arensman&#8217;s dogged defence not enough to bring him the victory.

After a brutal fourth stage, Arensman only had a slim 11-second lead over Storer to defend across the 2,400m.</p>\n<p>Once again, there were several attacks right from the flag dropping, despite only 79 of the 100 starters on day one remaining after four days of tough racing in South Tyrol.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the first categorised climb, Bannberg (4.8km at 9.2%), a 15-rider group got away from the front of the peloton: Lennard K√§mna (Lidl-Trek), Fran Miholjeviƒá, Finlay Pickering (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious), Matteo Vanhuffel (Development Team Picnic PostNL), Ben Zwiehoff, Emil Herzog (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Koen Bouwman (Jayco AlUla), Paul Seixas, Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Jakob Fuglsang (Israel-Premier Tech), Lucas Eriksson (Tudor), Vicente Rojas, Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®), Mattia Bais (Polti VisitMalta) and Daniel Geismayr (Vorarlberg).</p>\n<p>With Seixas&#8217; 9:49 deficit to Arensman placing him the closest on GC, there was no threat to Ineos or Tudor, allowing the large group to build up more than a three-minute lead over the first few climbs.</p>\n<p>After a descent down into the valley, the gap stabilised at 3:40, ahead of the second ascent up the Bannberg. This is where Tudor made their bid to claim overall victory, with the Swiss team doing a full gas lead-out at the foot of the climb with Storer in the wheel.</p>\n<p>The men in black and red made the difference quickly, dropping all of Arensman&#8217;s teammates and everyone else in the GC group with their initial push. Florian Stork did the final surge, which left only Storer and Arensman on his wheel.</p>\n<p>Storer attacked with 34km to go after Stork had already threatened to distance the Dutchman, and he very quickly left Arensman behind on the tree-lined climb.</p>\n<p>Action in the break had kicked off simultaneously, with the climbs taking their toll on the riders less suited to the undulating terrain. Eight made it over the second ascent of the Bannberg in a separate group, with Storer 2:55 down and Arensman a further 35 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>One of those who dropped out of the break, however, was by design and not legs. Tudor had Eriksson in front, who&#8217;d gone away in the large 15-rider break, and he was quickly in front of Storer and protecting him from the wind on the roads that preceded the final Stronach (3.1 km at 12.3%) climb.</p>\n<p>Arensman, contrastingly, was all alone and losing time. With 15km to go on stage 5, his deficit to Storer had grown to more than a minute. Eriksson had executed his job perfectly, leaving Storer just 1:50 to try and snatch the stage win from the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Seixas looked the strongest out of the break and made his bid for glory with 11.4km remaining. Those behind struggled to follow the junior TT world champion, except for his teammate, Prodhomme, who, after looking at those behind, realised he too was stronger than the rest.</p>\n<p>Having bridged across, the two Decathlon riders worked well together and crested the final climb of this year&#8217;s Tour of the Alps, having held a 1:30 lead from Storer. They would not be denied.</p>\n<p>They rode to the finish together, with a decision being made for Prodhomme to take victory in the end, knowing that super talent Seixas is likely to get many more chances to take a first pro victory and several more throughout his career.</p>\n<p>Storer continued to push on, right the way through to the finish line, finishing the day in eighth, 1:44 ahead of Arensman in ninth on the day. This confirmed the switch at the top of the overall standings and saw Storer take the overall win in Austria, the third GC title of his career so far.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2015, the race merged with the nearby one-day race Trofeo Melinda, and the 2015 edition was called the Giro del Trentino Melinda. In 2017, the event was renamed Tour of the Alps, as it addresses the entire Euroregion of Tyrol‚ÄìSouth Tyrol‚ÄìTrentino, formed by three different regional authorities in two countries: the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. It should not be confused with the similarly named Giro al Sas di Trento, an annual road running competition in the city of Trento.

They built out a four-minute lead as the race dipped back into Italy and climbed to Lago di Misurina, before heading north back to the Austrian border.</p>\n<p>That gap quickly fell to below a minute as the action in the peloton kicked off up the Passo di Sant&#8217;Antonio and Passo Monte Croce di Comelico, led mainly by Lidl-Trek for Giulio Ciccone.</p>\n<p>Several of the GC favourites came to the fore in a series of attacks and counter moves, with nine eventually getting up the road: Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious), Arensman, Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL), Gee, Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R), Eddie Dunbar, Engelhardt (Jayco AlUla) and Storer.</p>\n<p>Arensman then took off alone in the cold and rain, extending an initial 30-second lead out to 2:50 on the peloton after getting back to Austria with 50km to go.

Hindley moved up to 45 seconds down on Storer.</p>\n<p>Stage 4 of the Tour of the Alps is another day in the Italian and Austrian Alps, with a 162.7km ride from Sillian to Obertilliach.</p>\n<p>Frigo pointed to the sky as he celebrated his first professional victory. He was the Italian Under 23 national champion in 2019 and has finally confirmed his talents as a professional as he prepares for the Giro d&#8217;Italia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a great day,&#8221; Frigo said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew it could be a day for a breakaway, and we had to pay attention to that. Luckily, I got into the big group, but that means chaos and anarchy. I knew it was a good idea to try to attack from a distance and try to make a selection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a bit of a risk to attack from so far. It was also a test for the legs as I&#8217;m preparing for the Giro. I didn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d stay away in the first part of the attacks, but once the gap wasn&#8217;t closing. I did everything I could to stay away.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first hour of the 145.5km stage from Vipiteno-Racines to San Candido was covered at over 50km/h as the riders blasted along the valley road east towards the Austrian border.</p>\n<p>Frigo made sure he was in the early attack of 21 riders that went away, and they pushed on during the Antermoia climb that touched the northern edge of the Dolomites. Also in there were Lennard K√§mna (Lidl-Trek), Alessandro De Marchi (Jaco AlUla) and Hugh Carthy (EF Education-EasyPost), creating a quality breakaway.</p>\n<p>Tudor had Florian Stork in the attack, and with the German only 1:09, rival teams were forced to pick up the chase, with Lidl-Trek spending a lot of time on the front, pegging the gap to 3:00.</p>\n<p>Frigo wasn&#8217;t happy with the big break and so attacked alone on the Furkelpass with more than 70km to go.</p>\n<p>Most of the other attackers were caught on the long climb, but Frigo powered on in a brave and strong attack. He was not an overall threat, and so Storer and Tudor let him gain close to 4:00 with 40km to go.</p>\n<p>The final Vierschachberg climb was Frigo&#8217;s final test after a passage through the finish area with 21km to go. He kept the remains of the break at a safe distance of powered up the 5.9km climb that zig-zagged up the side of the mountain.</p>\n<p>His teammate Matthew Riccitello made a determined attack to try to shake up the overall classification.</p>\n<p>The American climber got a gap but also dragged the GC riders closer to Frigo, as they chased him down over the summit and on the testing descent.</p>\n<p>Riccitello was eventually caught, but Frigo was still 40 seconds clear after the descent and so had time to ease up, celebrate his victory and savour his first professional victory.</p>\n<p>The 27-rider GC group finished just 19 seconds behind him, with the only time differences created by the bonus seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1962, it was named Giro del Trentino (English: Tour of Trentino) until 2016, and run over four stages in the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol region of Italy. In 2015, the race merged with the nearby one-day race Trofeo Melinda, and the 2015 edition was called the Giro del Trentino Melinda. In 2017, the event was renamed Tour of the Alps, as it addresses the entire Euroregion of Tyrol‚ÄìSouth Tyrol‚ÄìTrentino, formed by three different regional authorities in two countries: the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. It should not be confused with the similarly named Giro al Sas di Trento, an annual road running competition in the city of Trento. Since its rebranding, the race is run mid-to-late April over five stages, as a 2.HC event of the UCI Europe Tour, the level beneath the UCI World Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech) won stage 3 of the Tour of the Alps, the first victory of his professional career, after attacking the high-speed breakaway of the day with over 70km left to run before holding off the GC contenders.</p>\n<p>Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) won the sprint for second place, 19 seconds down on Frigo, to take six precious bonus seconds, with Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) finishing third to take four bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the time Michael Storer (Tudor) gained with victory on stage 2, the Australian kept the race leader&#8217;s green jersey. He leads Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) by 41 seconds, with French super talent Paul Seixas (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) third at 41 seconds. Hindley moved up to 45 seconds down on Storer.</p>\n<p>Stage 4 of the Tour of the Alps is another day in the Italian and Austrian Alps, with a 162.7km ride from Sillian to Obertilliach.</p>\n<p>Frigo pointed to the sky as he celebrated his first professional victory. He was the Italian Under 23 national champion in 2019 and has finally confirmed his talents as a professional as he prepares for the Giro d&#8217;Italia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a great day,&#8221; Frigo said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We knew it could be a day for a breakaway, and we had to pay attention to that. Luckily, I got into the big group, but that means chaos and anarchy. I knew it was a good idea to try to attack from a distance and try to make a selection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a bit of a risk to attack from so far. It was also a test for the legs as I&#8217;m preparing for the Giro. I didn&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d stay away in the first part of the attacks, but once the gap wasn&#8217;t closing. I did everything I could to stay away.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first hour of the 145.5km stage from Vipiteno-Racines to San Candido was covered at over 50km/h as the riders blasted along the valley road east towards the Austrian border.</p>\n<p>Frigo made sure he was in the early attack of 21 riders that went away, and they pushed on during the Antermoia climb that touched the northern edge of the Dolomites. Also in there were Lennard K√§mna (Lidl-Trek), Alessandro De Marchi (Jaco AlUla) and Hugh Carthy (EF Education-EasyPost), creating a quality breakaway.</p>\n<p>Tudor had Florian Stork in the attack, and with the German only 1:09, rival teams were forced to pick up the chase, with Lidl-Trek spending a lot of time on the front, pegging the gap to 3:00.</p>\n<p>Frigo wasn&#8217;t happy with the big break and so attacked alone on the Furkelpass with more than 70km to go.</p>\n<p>Most of the other attackers were caught on the long climb, but Frigo powered on in a brave and strong attack. He was not an overall threat, and so Storer and Tudor let him gain close to 4:00 with 40km to go.</p>\n<p>The final Vierschachberg climb was Frigo&#8217;s final test after a passage through the finish area with 21km to go. He kept the remains of the break at a safe distance of powered up the 5.9km climb that zig-zagged up the side of the mountain.</p>\n<p>His teammate Matthew Riccitello made a determined attack to try to shake up the overall classification.</p>\n<p>The American climber got a gap but also dragged the GC riders closer to Frigo, as they chased him down over the summit and on the testing descent.</p>\n<p>Riccitello was eventually caught, but Frigo was still 40 seconds clear after the descent and so had time to ease up, celebrate his victory and savour his first professional victory.</p>\n<p>The 27-rider GC group finished just 19 seconds behind him, with the only time differences created by the bonus seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) took victory on the opening stage of the 2025 Tour of the Alps after a mountainous day starting and finishing in San Lorenzo Dorsino.</p>\n<p>The Italian rider won a reduced sprint after following several attacks in the closing stages. After both made attacks in the finale, the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale duo of Felix Gall and Paul Seixas finished second and third, respectively.</p>\n<p>Although on paper this was the toughest stage of the week, the climbs were not challenging enough to cause a significant selection, with just seconds splitting the top twenty riders. The likes of Alexander Cepeda (EF Education-EasyPost) and Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla) attempted to break clear on the final classified climb of the day, the Passo Durone, but Lidl-Trek were determined to chase down every move.</p>\n<p>It was a first win for the Italian since stage 8 of the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© in 2023 and the three-time Giro d‚ÄôItalia stage winner was pleased to put his arms in the air ahead of the Italian Grand Tour next month.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt was a long time without victory for me. I really needed it today. I think also it‚Äôs even more special in Italy. After a long time in altitude, it&#8217;s always good to restart the racing with a victory,‚Äù Ciccone said afterwards.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHonestly, it was really, really hard. We went super fast from the start. I&#8217;m really, really happy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Ciccone‚Äôs Lidl-Trek team had been on the front for most of the day, with Tao Geoghegan Hart doing much of the work on the final climb to pull back a plucky Mattia Bais (Polti-Visit Malta).</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think we did a great job today. Yeah, I really need to say thanks to all my teammates. We had a plan and I think we did it in the perfect way.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe Tour of the Alps is a race often used as a final tune-up for the first Grand Tour of the year, the Giro d‚ÄôItalia. Stage 1, which started and finished in San Lorenzo Dorsino, is perhaps the hardest stage of the entire week on paper.</p>\n<p>Three riders made it into the early breakaway of the day. Finlay Pickering (Bahrain Victorious), AJ August (Ineos Grenadiers) and Davide Bais (Polti-Visit Malta) survived until the foot of the final classified climb of the day with 25km to go.</p>\n<p>Pickering made one final attempt to stay clear before being joined by Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla), who had broken clear of the peloton controlled by Lidl-Trek on the Passo Durone‚Äôs steep early slopes. The pair never built much of an advantage and were brought back halfway up the climb.</p>\n<p>Several attackers attempted to break clear as the peloton whittled down. EF Education-EasyPost‚Äôs Alexander Cepeda made it stick, building a gap of around 15 seconds over the peloton at the top with Paul Double (Jayco-AlUla) and Seixas in between.</p>\n<p>Cepeda lost his lead on the 12km descent before the final 8km rise to the line and was caught by a chasing group of 20 before the foot of the climb.</p>\n<p>Bais attacked as the final ascent back into San Lorenzo Dorsino began, immediately building a lead of 15 seconds which he held for much of the finale. As the final three kilometres pitched upwards, Bais‚Äô gap began to come down and with two kilometres left, the local rider was caught by the peloton led by Geoghegan Hart.</p>\n<p>The group still numbered around twenty as they passed through the final kilometre. Gall and Cepeda traded accelerations, with the likes of Ciccone and Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL) chasing on.</p>\n<p>It was Max Poole (Picnic-PostNL) who led out the sprint round the final sweeping corner before Ciccone came over the top to secure his first win of the season ahead of the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale pairing of Gall and Seixas.</p>\n<p>Going into the next stage, Ciccone has a four second lead over the Austrian Gall, with Seixas a further two seconds behind. The race is wide open with the top 25 riders separated by less than a minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=62&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida claimed a stunning overall victory in the Itzulia Basque Country, shredding the GC field on a brutally tough day to both earn a second stage win and simultaneously become Portugal&#8217;s first-ever overall winner of the 101-year-old race.</p>\n<p>Enric Mas (Movistar) and Almeida attacked from a small lead group with 5.5km to go, with Almeida then comfortably outsprinting Mas at the finish to take his second stage in three days. Stage 5 winner Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), in the breaks all day and having made much of the running in the late climbs, finished third, 13 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Overall, Almeida succeeded his teammate Juan Ayuso as the overall winner of Itzulia Basque Country, with Mas moving up second place on GC thanks to his strong last day of racing. Early leader Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) claimed third.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates dominated a dificult, rain-soaked stage with nearly 4,000 metres of vertical climbing, as Almeida personally ripped a reduced bunch apart on the race&#8217;s hardest ascent, the category 1 Izua and then led the pursuit of  lone breakaway Healy. </p>\n<p>Having caught the Irishman 20 kilometres from the line, Almeida followed Mas when the Movistar rider raised the pace on a short kicker in the finish town of Ermua. He then outsprinted the Spaniard for his first WorldTour stage race win since the Tour de Pologne back in 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased,&#8221; Almeida, the race leader since he soloed to victory on stage 4, said afterwards. &#8220;The team did a great job, we did it perfectly, and that&#8217;s all there was to it. Onto the next one!</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in good shape, the route wasn&#8217;t ideal for me, but we always did the best we could. We have to be very satisfied with this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOne of the race&#8217;s earliest attackers on stage 2, Diego Uriarte (Kern-Pharma) was also the first to go for it on the opening stretch out of the start-finish town of Eibar. But his move fizzled out fast and the peloton started to tackle the combined opening challenge of the category 3 Elkorrieta and first-category Azurki, which followed on immediately, all together.</p>\n<p>An enormous group of nearly 20 riders then managed to extract itself from the Azurki, including former overall winners Dani Mart√≠nez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Ion Izagirre (Cofidis), Healy, Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) and mountains classification leader Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale). </p>\n<p>Over the next ascent, the Krabellin, the break began to split apart, and 100 kilometres from the finish Armirail went clear. He started scooping up more and more points on the climbs to buttress his mountain classification lead. But with barely a minute on a chasing group of 13 at the stage&#8217;s halfway point and three big classified climbs still remaining, it was far from certain he could stay ahead. </p>\n<p>Almeida, meanwhile, with no less than four teammates still guiding him along, was safely ensconced in the peloton some three minutes back and happily watching the kilometres click down.</p>\n<p>Armirail was possibly even slightly relieved when finally three riders bridged across from the break: Dani Mart√≠nez, Healy and Jordan Jegat (TotalEnergies). Given his GC status, Jegat was one of the keenest to drive the stage leaders&#8217; group as they tore through the finish town of Eibar for one of multiple local hilly laps. </p>\n<p>However, the Frenchman&#8217;s efforts were not enough to prevent a further seven riders joining: Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek), Izagirre, Callum Scotson (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Warren Barguil and Guillermo Mart√≠nez (both Picnic-PostNL), Groupama-FDJ&#8217;s Romain Gr√©goire and Marc Hirshi (Tudor).</p>\n<p>The weather was not in the breakaway&#8217;s favour as after five days of dry conditions, heavy rain set in, briefly at first on the fifth classified climb, the gently rising category 2 Karabieta, and then with a lot more teeming down in the final hour. That steadily worsening weather didn&#8217;t stop Armirail from taking a definitive lead on the mountains ranking at the top of the Karabieta, and the Frenchman notably began to take things more gently in the break as a result. </p>\n<p>At the opposite end of the move, meanwhile, Hirschi pushed on solo on the final segment of the long descent off the Karabieta, quickly gaining a double-digit advantage.</p>\n<p>The Swiss racer&#8217;s bid for glory didn&#8217;t work out, but the higher pace he set briefly garnered the break a further 40 seconds, and also weeded out a few of the weaker elements like Mollema.

It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida claimed a stunning overall victory in the Itzulia Basque Country, shredding the GC field on a brutally tough day to both earn a second stage win and simultaneously become Portugal&#8217;s first-ever overall winner of the 101-year-old race.</p>\n<p>Enric Mas (Movistar) and Almeida attacked from a small lead group with 5.5km to go, with Almeida then comfortably outsprinting Mas at the finish to take his second stage in three days. Stage 5 winner Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost), in the breaks all day and having made much of the running in the late climbs, finished third, 13 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Overall, Almeida succeeded his teammate Juan Ayuso as the overall winner of Itzulia Basque Country, with Mas moving up second place on GC thanks to his strong last day of racing. Early leader Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) claimed third.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates dominated a dificult, rain-soaked stage with nearly 4,000 metres of vertical climbing, as Almeida personally ripped a reduced bunch apart on the race&#8217;s hardest ascent, the category 1 Izua and then led the pursuit of  lone breakaway Healy. </p>\n<p>Having caught the Irishman 20 kilometres from the line, Almeida followed Mas when the Movistar rider raised the pace on a short kicker in the finish town of Ermua. He then outsprinted the Spaniard for his first WorldTour stage race win since the Tour de Pologne back in 2021.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased,&#8221; Almeida, the race leader since he soloed to victory on stage 4, said afterwards. &#8220;The team did a great job, we did it perfectly, and that&#8217;s all there was to it. Onto the next one!</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in good shape, the route wasn&#8217;t ideal for me, but we always did the best we could. We have to be very satisfied with this.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOne of the race&#8217;s earliest attackers on stage 2, Diego Uriarte (Kern-Pharma) was also the first to go for it on the opening stretch out of the start-finish town of Eibar. But his move fizzled out fast and the peloton started to tackle the combined opening challenge of the category 3 Elkorrieta and first-category Azurki, which followed on immediately, all together.</p>\n<p>An enormous group of nearly 20 riders then managed to extract itself from the Azurki, including former overall winners Dani Mart√≠nez (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Ion Izagirre (Cofidis), Healy, Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) and mountains classification leader Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale). </p>\n<p>Over the next ascent, the Krabellin, the break began to split apart, and 100 kilometres from the finish Armirail went clear. He started scooping up more and more points on the climbs to buttress his mountain classification lead. But with barely a minute on a chasing group of 13 at the stage&#8217;s halfway point and three big classified climbs still remaining, it was far from certain he could stay ahead. </p>\n<p>Almeida, meanwhile, with no less than four teammates still guiding him along, was safely ensconced in the peloton some three minutes back and happily watching the kilometres click down.</p>\n<p>Armirail was possibly even slightly relieved when finally three riders bridged across from the break: Dani Mart√≠nez, Healy and Jordan Jegat (TotalEnergies). Given his GC status, Jegat was one of the keenest to drive the stage leaders&#8217; group as they tore through the finish town of Eibar for one of multiple local hilly laps. </p>\n<p>However, the Frenchman&#8217;s efforts were not enough to prevent a further seven riders joining: Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek), Izagirre, Callum Scotson (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Warren Barguil and Guillermo Mart√≠nez (both Picnic-PostNL), Groupama-FDJ&#8217;s Romain Gr√©goire and Marc Hirshi (Tudor).</p>\n<p>The weather was not in the breakaway&#8217;s favour as after five days of dry conditions, heavy rain set in, briefly at first on the fifth classified climb, the gently rising category 2 Karabieta, and then with a lot more teeming down in the final hour. That steadily worsening weather didn&#8217;t stop Armirail from taking a definitive lead on the mountains ranking at the top of the Karabieta, and the Frenchman notably began to take things more gently in the break as a result. </p>\n<p>At the opposite end of the move, meanwhile, Hirschi pushed on solo on the final segment of the long descent off the Karabieta, quickly gaining a double-digit advantage.</p>\n<p>The Swiss racer&#8217;s bid for glory didn&#8217;t work out, but the higher pace he set briefly garnered the break a further 40 seconds, and also weeded out a few of the weaker elements like Mollema. Things were not looking so promising behind, though, because UAE were laying down a ferocious pace in the peloton. The leader&#8217;s squad barely even paused when Almeida was briefly delayed by the foot of the Izua by a slow-motion crash involving Ilan van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep) on a very slippery right hand bend, squeezing the gap to less than 30 seconds.</p>\n<p>Healy made a determined bid to stay ahead as the break crumbled, pulling Scotson and Dani Mart√≠nez with him on the punishing Izua.

It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) stole away from the day&#8217;s decisive breakaway on an uncategorised climb and raced alone for 55km into the stage 5 victory at the Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>The Irishman crossed the finish line 1:47 ahead of the solo chaser Axel Laurance (Ineos-Grenadiers), and 1:48 ahead of the reduced group sprint won by Simone Velasco (XDS Astana Team) in Gernika-Lumo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had good legs today and glad I could finish it off in the end like I did,&#8221; Healy said in a post-race interview. &#8220;We had two guys in the breakaway and it was a strong group, and we didn&#8217;t want to risk it, so I went in the tailwind, had good legs today, keep a gap and made it stick to the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the overall classification, JoƒÅo Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) continues to lead the race by 30 seconds ahead of Maximilian Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) and 38 seconds ahead of Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe), all having finished safely in the reduced group.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton reached the penultimate stage 5 of the Itzulia Basque Country, tackling a 172.3km route from Urdu√±a to Gernika-Lumo. The route was hilly, with four category-three climbs at Las Campas, Sarasola, Aretxabalgane, and Errigoiti. But that wasn&#8217;t the end of the climbing because in the last 40km of the race, they still covered three more uncategorised ascents and smaller pitches before a run into Gernika-Lumo.</p>\n<p>Attacks over the Las Campas ascent early in the race thinned out the peloton and led to a few short lived breakaways, but it wasn&#8217;t until the 20km mark that a breakaway of six set off that initially included Healy and his teammate Alex Baudin, and Pello Bilbao (Bahrain-Victorious), who were later joined by Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Warren Barguil (Picnic PostNL) and Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling).</p>\n<p>Barguil was the highest-placed in this group&#8217;s GC standings, but at nearly five minutes behind, the move did not threaten race leader Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG managed the pace at the front of the field and the gap to the breakaway, which hovered between two and three minutes, as the race approached the halfway point. Groupama-FDJ and Movistar added a few riders to the front, too, bringing the gap down to under two minutes with 60km to go.</p>\n<p>The breakaway reached the first of the late-race uncategorised climbs, 55km out, where Healy attacked out of the move and raced over the top pushing his lead out to a minute ahead of Bilbao, Barguil, Alaphilippe and Baudin sitting on the back, while Armirail fell off pace.</p>\n<p>He gained time on the four chasers, he also gained 2:30 on the field led by Ineos-Grenadiers, later joined by Cofidis and Equipo Kern Pharma.</p>\n<p>The reduced peloton picked up Amirail and slashed the gap to Bilbao, Baudin, Barguil and Alaphilippe to under a minute as they reached another uncategorised climb with 35km remaining.</p>\n<p>With speed and skill, Healy bombed the next descent, extending his lead to nearly three minutes over the field, while the four chasers were reabsorbed into the group across the valley roads and into the final ascent of the stage.</p>\n<p>The reduced group behind included all of the major general classification riders, who watched one another for any attacks. Axel Laurance (Ineos-Grenadiers) accelerated and briefly cleared the field, but a quick pace from Enric Mas (Movistar) brought him back into the fold.</p>\n<p>Alex Aranburu (Cofidis) was the next to go, followed by Floria Lipowitz (Red Bull-Hansgrohe). As the pair were reeled in, Aranburu went again but this time the Spanish Champion was joined by race leader Almeida and then the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>Healy descended again and raced through the valley roads with six kilometres to go and into one last, smaller pitch, holding his gap at more than two minutes, the victory sewn up.</p>\n<p>Over the small climbs on the run-in to the finish, Laurance attacked again, this time gaining a few seconds on the field that seemed marginally content to let him go. The Frenchman held on to finish second on the day, crossing the line just one second ahead of the sprint for third, won by Velasco.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) stole away from the day&#8217;s decisive breakaway on an uncategorised climb and raced alone for 55km into the stage 5 victory at the Itzulia Basque Country.</p>\n<p>The Irishman crossed the finish line 1:47 ahead of the solo chaser Axel Laurance (Ineos-Grenadiers), and 1:48 ahead of the reduced group sprint won by Simone Velasco (XDS Astana Team) in Gernika-Lumo.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had good legs today and glad I could finish it off in the end like I did,&#8221; Healy said in a post-race interview. &#8220;We had two guys in the breakaway and it was a strong group, and we didn&#8217;t want to risk it, so I went in the tailwind, had good legs today, keep a gap and made it stick to the line.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the overall classification, JoƒÅo Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) continues to lead the race by 30 seconds ahead of Maximilian Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) and 38 seconds ahead of Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe), all having finished safely in the reduced group.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton reached the penultimate stage 5 of the Itzulia Basque Country, tackling a 172.3km route from Urdu√±a to Gernika-Lumo. The route was hilly, with four category-three climbs at Las Campas, Sarasola, Aretxabalgane, and Errigoiti. But that wasn&#8217;t the end of the climbing because in the last 40km of the race, they still covered three more uncategorised ascents and smaller pitches before a run into Gernika-Lumo.</p>\n<p>Attacks over the Las Campas ascent early in the race thinned out the peloton and led to a few short lived breakaways, but it wasn&#8217;t until the 20km mark that a breakaway of six set off that initially included Healy and his teammate Alex Baudin, and Pello Bilbao (Bahrain-Victorious), who were later joined by Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team), Warren Barguil (Picnic PostNL) and Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling).</p>\n<p>Barguil was the highest-placed in this group&#8217;s GC standings, but at nearly five minutes behind, the move did not threaten race leader Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG managed the pace at the front of the field and the gap to the breakaway, which hovered between two and three minutes, as the race approached the halfway point. Groupama-FDJ and Movistar added a few riders to the front, too, bringing the gap down to under two minutes with 60km to go.</p>\n<p>The breakaway reached the first of the late-race uncategorised climbs, 55km out, where Healy attacked out of the move and raced over the top pushing his lead out to a minute ahead of Bilbao, Barguil, Alaphilippe and Baudin sitting on the back, while Armirail fell off pace.</p>\n<p>He gained time on the four chasers, he also gained 2:30 on the field led by Ineos-Grenadiers, later joined by Cofidis and Equipo Kern Pharma.</p>\n<p>The reduced peloton picked up Amirail and slashed the gap to Bilbao, Baudin, Barguil and Alaphilippe to under a minute as they reached another uncategorised climb with 35km remaining.</p>\n<p>With speed and skill, Healy bombed the next descent, extending his lead to nearly three minutes over the field, while the four chasers were reabsorbed into the group across the valley roads and into the final ascent of the stage.</p>\n<p>The reduced group behind included all of the major general classification riders, who watched one another for any attacks. Axel Laurance (Ineos-Grenadiers) accelerated and briefly cleared the field, but a quick pace from Enric Mas (Movistar) brought him back into the fold.</p>\n<p>Alex Aranburu (Cofidis) was the next to go, followed by Floria Lipowitz (Red Bull-Hansgrohe). As the pair were reeled in, Aranburu went again but this time the Spanish Champion was joined by race leader Almeida and then the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>Healy descended again and raced through the valley roads with six kilometres to go and into one last, smaller pitch, holding his gap at more than two minutes, the victory sewn up.</p>\n<p>Over the small climbs on the run-in to the finish, Laurance attacked again, this time gaining a few seconds on the field that seemed marginally content to let him go. The Frenchman held on to finish second on the day, crossing the line just one second ahead of the sprint for third, won by Velasco.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Race leader Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) finished third after fighting hard to defend his yellow jersey but ultimately had to hand over control of the GC to his Portuguese rival.</p>\n<p>Almeida now has two tough days to stay on top of the overall, but as things stand, he is well positioned to try to follow on from his teammate Juan Ayuso as the outright winner of Itzulia Pais Vasco.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very pleased, I didn&#8217;t feel like I had the best legs today but perhaps everybody was feeling like that after such a tough stage on Wednesday,&#8221; Almeida, already the winner of a summit finish in Paris-Nice this March, said afterwards.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was well-placed on that final climb, even though I was quite a way back at the start because I didn&#8217;t feel I had very much to give. But by keeping at my own steady pace, it all worked out.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I gave it everything, I got first, and I&#8217;m very pleased as to how the team raced, too. So here we are.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>A fast start, with one early attack briefly including 2024 Itzulia mountains winner Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike), failed to work out and for more than an hour no breaks managed to stick. However, another move involving Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) on the relentless series of Cat.3 climbs proved more successful. </p>\n<p>It helped that Simmons was later joined by teammate Andrea Baglioli (Lidl-Trek), Kuss  (again), and six other riders: Ben Healy and Alex Baudin (Both EF Education-EasyPost), Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AIUIa), Finn Fisher-Black (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates &#8211; XRG) and Leo Bisiaux (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale). Finally, Txomin Juaristi (Euskaltel-Euskadi) and Ander Okamika (Burgos-Burpellet-BH) bridged across and made it up to 11 in the break of the day.</p>\n<p>The last of the six Cat.3 climbs, the gently rising Milloi, reduced the gap to 1:28 for the move ahead, even while taking maximum points at the top allowed Soler to move into the lead of the mountains classification. Cofidis and Bahrain Victorious set a ferocious pace in the pack on the flatter valley roads that followed, though, and as the decisive Izua approached, their advantage was definitely diminishing.</p>\n<p>35 seconds with 20 kilometres to go was far small a margin for the 11 ahead to have any chance of staying away, and shortly afterwards they were all but reeled in, with a still very large peloton riding at full tilt as the road began to rise gently even before the official start of the decisive Izua ascent. </p>\n<p>Okamika and Schmid did their best to stay clear, but to no avail, and Simmons himself quickly switched from breakaway to domestique mode, leading the bunch onto the foot of a short but very punishing climb.</p>\n<p>The peloton shrank to just 40 riders in the agonisingly steep, wooded slopes of the Izua, allowing Bahrain Victorious. </p>\n<p>As the road narrowed to the width of a car at most and wound its way up the side of a cliff at gradients averaging around 18%, Colombian climber Santiago Buitrago was the first to open fire. But GC contender Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was shadowing him closely, and Almeida was not much further back.</p>\n<p>Almeida then opted to put in a trademark driving acceleration, slowly forcing a gap around first around the fourth wheel in the line of riders following him, then going clear 2.2 kilometres from the top. </p>\n<p>Race leader Schachmann was already lagging behind, and as he told reporters afterwards, his main idea was to maintain a steady pace rather than risk going into the red. But there was no sign of Almeida doing that either, as the UAE leader easily conquered the steeper part of the ascent at the head of the race. The,n as the incline eased close to the top, of course, Almeida could push himself even harder and open up his margin even further.</p>\n<p>Given the relative shortness of the climb, Almeida managed to carve out an impressively healthy advantage of around 33 seconds at the summit after pushing on through a line of cheering, flag- waving Basque fans. </p>\n<p>However, neither Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), Alex Aranburu (Cofidis) and  Enric Mas (Movistar) showed any sign of giving up the pursuit as they led a powerful chase group on the ultra-fast, twisting drop off the Izua, particularly when skilled descenders like Schachmann and teammate Ilan van Wilder managed to regain contact and further boosted its firepower.</p>\n<p>Yet they simply could not match Almeida, touching speeds of up to 80kph on a thankfully very dry descent and maintaining his margin easily as he shot downwards and past the outlying houses of the finish town. </p>\n<p>Then, after negotiating a couple of technical corners without any of the errors of the previous day&#8217;s finish, the 26-year-old finally had his second WorldTour stage victory of the season in the bag &#8211; and the GC and points leads in his power as well.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead, Almeida has a 30-second advantage overall with two days remaining, and in a race often decided by margins of less than a minute, that could well be sufficient for the Portuguese rider to claim his first week-long stage race since the Tour de Pologne back in 2021. </p>\n<p>Friday&#8217;s rolling leg from Ordu√±a to Gernika-Lumo is likely to end with a breakaway victory for non-GC contenders. But Saturday&#8217;s toughest stage, including a repeat ascent of the ultra-difficult Izua, will surely see his rivals put Almeida to the test again.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been an up and down day for Alex Aranburu (Cofidis). After crossing the line solo to win stage 3 of the Itzulia, he celebrated his accomplishment but before he could get to the podium ceremony, he learned that France&#8217;s Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) was declared the winner of stage 3 with the jury deeming Aranburu went the incorrect way around a roundabout, getting an unfair advantage. </p>\n<p>Television footage released after the disqualification showed Aranburu clearly going off course at a point around 800 metres from the line, where the race route was not fully barriered, to head on a right-hand direction, also shorter, round the roundabout.</p>\n<p>Hours later, after several objections, the jury decided to return the stage victory to Aranburu because the signage on the course pointed him in the direction he went.</p>\n<p>The jury&#8217;s statement read, &#8220;Following the initial footage received, we made the decision to disqualify rider number 51 for &#8216;Deviation from the race route constituting an advantage,&#8217; as the images appeared to show that the rider had taken the roundabout in a way that was deviating from the signposted route.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, after receiving and reviewing additional evidence, including data from Veloviewer, the roadbook, and the team, it became clear that all available information indicated that the roundabout in question was to be taken in the manner chosen by the Cofidis rider.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In accordance with Article 1.2.064 of the UCI regulations, which states that &#8216;Riders shall study the course in advance&#8217;. In this case, the rider correctly followed the indicated path.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Apparently, there was a signage error at the roundabout in question, and the Commissaires&#8217; Panel overturned their initial relegation and restored the faultless Aranburu, who attacked in the closing kilometres of the hilly 157-kilometre stage to win solo in Beasain.</p>\n<p>Gr√©goire was returned to second place on the stage, having led the peloton across the finish line three seconds behind the Spaniard.</p>\n<p>Race leader Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) snatched valuable bonus seconds by finishing close behind Gr√©goire. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I saw that he attacked with about a kilometre to go, Jo√£o Almeida [UAE Team Emirates] was closing the gap, then there was a roundabout to the left, then we didn&#8217;t see him after that,&#8221; Gr√©goire told Eurosport later.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was just focussed on the rider ahead of me, I don&#8217;t know if there was any race signage. Even if I win, it&#8217;s not a real victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gregoire&#8217;s bemusement at taking the win was visible in his muted celebrations on the winner&#8217;s podium.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very bizarre situation, I don&#8217;t really have the sensation of having won,&#8221; Gr√©goire said a little later. &#8220;[But] I think the commissaires have done their job, I&#8217;ve seen the replay, and I could see how he gained a margin. Those moments were decisive.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIf the end of the stage was mired in controversy, two riders failed to begin what proved to be a non-stop day of race action on Wednesday&#8217;s hilly trek: both the previous day&#8217;s winner and points classification leader Caleb Ewen (Ineos Grenadiers) as well as Visma-Lease a Bike all-rounder Victor Campenaerts, who crashed late on stage 2. </p>\n<p>After a blisteringly-fast start for the stage with over 3,000 metres of vertical climbing, Bruno Armirail (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) managed to go clear on the second of the day&#8217;s classified ascents, the grindingly long, if never overly steep, category 3 Andazarrate. </p>\n<p>By the summit of the 13.4km climb, the French National Time Trial Champion had opened up a gap of over a minute, and despite some powerful counterattacks by riders like Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), Armirail maintained that narrow advantage deep into the race&#8217;s second hour and a seemingly never-ending series of heavily wooded hills.</p>\n<p>Armirail&#8217;s lone effort eventually petered out at the stage&#8217;s halfway point at the foot of the last category 2 climb of the Mandubia, and some initial skirmishing between the GC favourites began for the first time in the 2025 race. Isaac del Toro (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) tested the waters early on the climb and three kilometres from the top a more concerted effort went clear with Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates), Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p>With more than 70 kilometres to go, it was hard to conceive such a major overall bid truly going the distance. Yet even so, the chasing was so intense to bring that attack back in, that even though it proved successful, the pursuit reduced the front group down to just 30 riders.</p>\n<p>On a day of non-stop attacking, UAE, obviously under instructions to keep the pressure on, promptly opted to fire Marc Soler up the road and the Catalan, just 28 seconds ahead on GC, was joined by Rudy Molard (Groupama-FDJ) and Clement Berthet (Decathlon-AG2R), as the trio headed onto a series of flatter valley roads. </p>\n<p>But on the short but painfully steep Gainza climb that followed, first Molard and then Soler cracked as the pace slowed to 10 kph or less between two massive lines of cheering fans, leaving Berthet as the only rider ahead of a much-reduced peloton.</p>\n<p>Schachmann intelligently tried to get the chase going and gain time on his rivals with an attack at 25km to go, and although around a dozen riders followed in his wake, it split an already fragile mini-bunch almost completely. </p>\n<p>At the foot of the Lazkaomendi, with slopes rising up to a jaw-dropping 24%, Berthet&#8217;s crumbling advantage stood at a scant 16 seconds, only for Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana) to open up the chase, followed by Schachmann and Lipowitz.</p>\n<p>Berthet was finally caught, but Lipowitz&#8217;s driving acceleration that followed caused plenty of gaps to open, particularly when Schachmann then opted for another drive of his own. Suddenly Almeida burst out of the pack with 4.5km to go and flying down the descent, Almeida was quickly joined by Aranburu, with a pack of 10 riders further back. </p>\n<p>Almeida miscalculated at a curve, allowing Aranburu to gain more time as he went on the right side of a roundabout. But his daring move to victory ended in disaster when the commissaires decided that his shortcutting the route on that right side, as the course signage pointed to the left side, was worth a relegation, giving Gr√©goire a very unexpected win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is one of the races that make up the UCI World Tour calendar. As the Basque Country is a mountainous area, there are few flat stages, and thus the event favors those who are strong climbers. The race is characterized by its short stages, rarely exceeding 200 km, and steep ascents. While the ascents featured in the race are not particularly high compared to other stage races, they are among the steepest seen in professional cycling, some having sections with gradients reaching well above 20%.</p>\n<p>Max Schachmann (Soudal-QuickStep) set the best time from the early individual time trial starters and won stage 1 of Itzulia Basque Country on Monday.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), making his first appearance at Itzulia, came within half a second of the German to secure second place. Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) took third, a full second back, as the close times set the GC for the opening day of the week.</p>\n<p>Schachmann, who also won the opening ITT of Itzulia Basque Country in 2019, secured his position in the hot seat early on, the 27th rider to complete the course, and 141 other riders not disturbing his comfort for nearly three hours.</p>\n<p>US Time Trial Champion Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates) was the last rider on the course and looked to be on a tear after the first time check, but he faded to 24th.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I left it all out on the road, and of course, I&#8217;d love to start it again like I did in 2019, but there are still a lot of good riders left to come,&#8221; Schachmann said once he set the best time in a post-race interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard, high-speed course, with not many sections to recover, so a short but spicy start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He said the multi-hour wait in the hot seat was almost as hard as the time trial itself, but was happy with the outcome, which was 20 months since his last UCI stage victory. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The Basque country seems to be good soil for me. It&#8217;s beautiful to be back in the leader&#8217;s jersey here.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very overwhelmed. It&#8217;s a long time since winning a WorldTour race, and I&#8217;m very thankful that my team believed in me.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThree of the last four Itzulia Basque Country stage races have started with a short individual time trial, this one 16.5 kilometres and relatively uncomplicated from Vitoria-Gasteiz to Baskonia-Alav√©s. However, the start ramp was located inside the Fernando Buesa basketball arena, then taking the riders on a clockwise circuit to the east and back, the finish in the car park outside the arena.</p>\n<p>A total of 168 riders would face one minor climb, the Arzubiaga (0.9 km √† 2.4%) after 4.3 kilometres, which will decide the first mountains classification leader.</p>\n<p>British time trial champion Ethan Hayter (Soudal-QuickStep) was the third rider on the course and was rewarded with rest in the hot seat, finishing in a time of 18:43.</p>\n<p>Another 24 riders swept across the wide-open road under clear, blue skies until Schachmann looked set to post a new best time, but he made an error in the final left-hand corner, turning right onto the car deviation instead. He corrected his mistake, made a u-turn and then returned to the course for the closing metres to the line, still riding six seconds faster than Hayter and posting a time of 18:37.</p>\n<p>A few riders later, Gianmarco Garofoli (Soudal-QuickStep) also carried his momentum in a final corner toward the same course deviation area, but correctly quickly, though he was well over a minute behind Schachmann&#8217;s time. Organisers appeared to then place a course marshal in a more obvious position for that section.</p>\n<p>However, 16 riders later, Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) sailed wide in the same area. Vlasov lost a lot of momentum but stayed upright to close to within 10 seconds behind Schachmann, good for third place at that time.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz looked as if he would upset the top of the standings, coming into the race with a second overall from Paris-Nice. He rose out of the saddle for his sprint to the line but finished one second slower to take provisional second.</p>\n<p>With 30 riders still to start, Soudal-QuickStep had a monopoly on the standings with three riders in the top five, Schachmann still in the hot seat, but the effort by Lipowitz gave the Red Bull team the other two spots.</p>\n<p>Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) hammered on the third segment of the course, once seventh best at the second intermediate sprint, and came within 0.54 of a second to Schachmann.</p>\n<p>Five riders behind Almeida, Tyler Stites (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) rolled down the start ramp to begin the final pack of 20, each rider having two-minute intervals and facing a slight change in weather conditions with some light wind.</p>\n<p>McNulty was the last man on the course and there were expectations he could disrupt the podium. Riding in the stars-and-stripes national jersey, the US rider passed through the first intermediate time check four seconds off the best time there set by Schachmann, but he lost 25 seconds over the final half of the race and finished 24th overall, 34 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Among the GC contenders, Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), who was third overall last year, finished 12 seconds back for eighth position. Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers) was 16 seconds back for 10th.</p>\n<p>Among the pre-favourites, Enric Mas (Movistar) rolled home 1:10 down on the stage leader Schachmann and now faces a challenging time loss. Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor Pro Cycling), likewise, was well back at 1:05 off the pace for a disappointing start to the week.</p>\n<p>Schachmann starts stage 2 in the golden leader&#8217;s jersey, and also holds the mountain classification lead. The longest stage of the race unfolds Tuesday, 199.8km from Pamplona-Iru√±a to Lodosa with constant undulations and just one classified climbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=6&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world.</p>\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) took his second stage win at the Volta Ciclista a Catalunya following a stunning solo ride, wrapping up the general classification on an explosive final stage in Barcelona. </p>\n<p>The Slovenian launched an attack on the Montju√Øc climb 20 kilometres from the finish and maintained his lead all the way to the line. Second place went to Laurens de Plus (Ineos-Grenadiers) and third to Lotto‚Äôs Lennert van Eetvelt.</p>\n<p>A thrilling battle for bonus seconds at the day‚Äôs two intermediate sprints preceded the fight for the stage, with Rogliƒç and Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) exchanging the leader‚Äôs jersey twice, but Ayuso was unable to match Rogliƒç‚Äôs superior tempo following his attack and was forced to relinquish his leader‚Äôs jersey on the final day of the race. The Spaniard finished second overall, 28 seconds adrift of  Rogliƒç, with Enric Mas (Movistar) completing the GC podium, at 0:53.</p>\n<p>A jubilant Rogliƒç spoke to reporters following the conclusion of the race. ‚ÄúFor me, it was about time, no? Here I was already, like, two times second and, yeah, it&#8217;s nice to finish it off. We did actually great sprint. I mean, I really don&#8217;t want to do these things, you know? </p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to decide it, on the mountains or on the climbs. But at the end, [it] came down to bonus seconds and fighting till the last stage. And at the end, I had the legs. Also, after the second bonus sprint, I had no choice. So if I wanted to win, I had to do something.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúNormally I always say, you know, Catalunya is an honest race, you know, the legs are talking, but here I didn&#8217;t really have the feeling till the very end stage, you know, because it was really tight. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The big mountain stage yesterday that I was hoping for was cancelled. So, unfortunately, or luckily, depends how you see it, everything came down to the last stage. The team was working well. I mean, we are racing, nice. We had a good time and really enjoyed this week.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI just had great fun here. Didn&#8217;t know exactly how it [would go]. Then pretty soon I figured out that, yes, obviously I&#8217;m ready. The legs are ready.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nThe traditional final stage of the Volta Catalunya took place on a city circuit around Barcelona. After 40 kilometres on the flat, six laps of a loop with the second category ascent of Montju√Øc at its centre would decide the final stage winner of the race, along with the overall classification.</p>\n<p>In a race where the GC thus far had depended on bonus seconds, the final stage looked set to go the same way, with two intermediate sprints prior to the Montju√Øc lap effectively making it a race of two halves. The first half was controlled by the GC teams, and Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe dominated the first intermediate sprint, with Rogliƒç taking the full three seconds and his teammate Nico Denz coming through in second place, leaving just one second for Ayuso. This flipped the situation at the top of the leaderboard once again with Rogliƒç taking a one-second lead.</p>\n<p>From there, the bunch remained intact and UAE Team Emirates-XRG took control of the pace-setting, with the intention of avoiding a repeat of the first sprint, and Ayuso duly accomplished a complete reversal of fortune, fighting his way through a wall of Red Bull riders to sprint for three seconds at the second sprint, with Rogliƒç back in third.</p>\n<p>After that, the floodgates opened, with attacks flying off from the front of the peloton, and the first to establish a sustainable gap was Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost), who enjoyed a spell solo before Bruno Armirail (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale) bridged across to the Ecuadorian in defence of his KOM jersey. Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe were not content to give up on Rogliƒç‚Äôs GC campaign however and duly took control of the pace-setting in the peloton, quickly neutralising the attempt of Carapaz and Armirail and snuffing out any hopes of a breakaway victory for the moment.</p>\n<p>The following lap, Groupama-FDJ‚Äôs Tom Donnenwirth launched a solo attack and was joined by Emanuel Buchmann (Cofidis) to form a new breakaway duo, but once again it was short-lived, as Rogliƒç pushed on himself, with Ayuso struggling to hold his wheel, and over the top of the climb he was able to carve out a solo lead heading into the final 20 kilometres of racing. It left Ayuso stranded without teammates, forced to lead in the chasing group and unable to find the legs to launch a counter-move.</p>\n<p>Yesterday‚Äôs stage winner Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) was the next to attack from the chasing group, with Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike) for company. The pair were closed down by Lotto, riding for Lennert van Eetvelt and lending a hand to Ayuso as his team sought to regroup. Meanwhile, Rogliƒç consolidated his lead, with more than 20 seconds over the rest of the GC hopefuls until Marc Soler took over the chase and began to eat into Rogliƒç‚Äôs advantage. </p>\n<p>It was Enric Mas (Movistar) who used Soler‚Äôs effort as a launchpad to attack, and he set off in pursuit of Rogliƒç with Axel Laurance (INEOS Grenadiers), Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) and van Eetvelt, and the quartet tried to close to the lone leader but were eventually tagged by the chase group once again with 10 kilometres to the line.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç‚Äôs gap held steady after that, despite the best efforts of Adam Yates to close the gap to no avail, and it was Laurens de Plus (INEOS Grenadiers) and van Eetvelt once again who used the final climb of the race to try and close down the race leader. </p>\n<p>The gap dropped below ten seconds briefly, but Rogliƒç held firm, and was able to cross the line solo to seal both the stage and the overall win, after an incredibly close battle throughout the week.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Igor managed to take third in the GC too so all things considered we‚Äôre happy with the week.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Vine finished 32 seconds ahead of the main group, with Davide Donati (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe Rookies) winning the sprint for second ahead of Alexey Lutsenko (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Ben Tulett entered the stage in the overall race lead with an 18-second margin over fellow Brit Mark Donovan (Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team). With the two riders finishing together in the main chase group, Tulett defended his eventual margin as he claimed overall race victory in Forli.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing to win this overall classification after five tough race days,‚Äù said Tulett. ‚ÄúWe started today with a solid lead in the general classification, so everything was about defending the jersey. We faced strong competition, but we executed our plan very well to bring it home. J√∏rgen was an incredible teammate today‚Äîhe really helped me a lot.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The final stage saw substantial splits in the peloton at 83 and 66km to go &#8211; with the former creating a lead group of around 40 &#8211; but no move proved decisive enough to split the peloton. As a result, the first half of the hilly 132.5km stage didn&#8217;t see a major breakaway, presenting the 6.5km shallow ascent of Rocca delle Caminate as the main obstacle to a mass finish.</p>\n<p>However, Lorenzo Nespoli (MBH Bank Ballan CSB) disrupted the calm, though, making a solo attack with 25km remaining. His move gained surprising traction as he pulled out to a gap of around 40 seconds on the approach to the Rocca delle Caminate.</p>\n<p>The peloton soon split into two halves, with a chase group consisting of almost half the peloton moving to within 20 seconds of Nespoli at the 20km to go mark.</p>\n<p>It was there that a two-man attack consisting of Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Filippo d&#8217;Aiuto (Petrolike) broke off the front of the peloton to bridge to Nespoli on the foothills of Rocca delle Caminate.</p>\n<p>By the summit of Rocca delle Caminate, the peloton was fragmented with Tulett leading a chase of Nespoli, Vine and d&#8217;Aiuto in defence of his race lead.</p>\n<p>Vine had taken a narrow lead over the top of the ascent and began to stretch out an advantage on the technical narrow descent into Forli &#8211; entering the final 10km with a 30-second lead over the assembled chasers and holding his lead all the way to the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world.</p>\n<p>A chaotic penultimate stage at the Volta a Catalunya resulted in a first World Tour-level victory for Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek), after just half an hour of racing. </p>\n<p>High winds curtailed the route that had been originally planned for the Queen stage, preventing the race from reaching the summit finish at Queralt. Race organisers proposed a new shortened route, and though they initially intended the peloton to complete a full lap of the circuit, the riders united to request that they race only the final portion of the first lap.</p>\n<p>After a fast and furious 28 kilometres of racing, mostly taking place on a long descent, Simmons launched a speculative attack under the flamme rouge, and despite being pursued by Pavel Bittner (Team Picnic-PostNL), he was able to hold off the rapidly approaching chasing pack to take the stage win. Bittner finished second, and Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) was third.</p>\n<p>There were no changes in the overall standings after a short and frenetic ride into Berga. Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) retains the race lead by a single second over Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) heading into tomorrow&#8217;s final circuit stage around Barcelona. Enric Mas (Movistar) remains in the third spot on GC.</p>\n<p>Simmons spoke about the day in his post-race interview: &#8220;It&#8217;s probably the strangest day of my career. First, we race, then we don&#8217;t race, then we do a short race, and then we do two laps of the race, and then we do 28k in the end. So yeah, it&#8217;s a bit surprising to be here, because if I&#8217;m honest I was one of the riders voting that we don&#8217;t start when we felt the wind today. But yeah, in the end, it&#8217;s a World Tour race and my first World Tour victory. So it&#8217;s super special.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone was a bit not knowing what was going on. And then, of course, when you race so short, it&#8217;s gonna be super nervous. We actually didn&#8217;t even know when the start was coming. I was back in the cars taking my leg warmers off, so I was like, third peloton in the descent, and rode back by myself. I thought maybe the day was already over about 2k into the stage. It was crazy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t actually supposed to be here. I got the call on Thursday to come. It&#8217;s super special to take my first World Tour victory, especially with my family watching at home, and my girlfriend and brother will be at the finish tomorrow. It&#8217;s almost a home race for me, living in Girona, you know, I&#8217;ll never get a race in the US, so I&#8217;ll have to call this my home race now, I guess.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My biggest objective for the week was tomorrow, and then I got the job done one day early. So the team can go home happy, and I can go home super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nOriginally planned to be the Queen stage of the race, stage 6 of the Volta Catalunya began with news that the route would be shortened due to winds in excess of 100mph at the summit of the climb of Queralt. At the start line in Berga, the peloton appeared to be no closer to understanding how the day would unfold.</p>\n<p>Instead of the planned summit finish up to Queralt, the proposed alternative was two laps around Berga, the first taken on by the peloton under fully neutralised conditions, to check on safety concerns, and survey the security of the route, before the full lap would then be ridden a second time if it was deemed to be safe.</p>\n<p>But it did not take long for the riders to lose patience with the arrangement and make their voices heard, as team leaders from the top teams took it in turn to visit the commissaire&#8217;s car.</p>\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç argued the case for racing from the point on the course they were at, rather than racing a full additional lap, following an afternoon which had already been ridden at a snail&#8217;s pace. The commissaire appeared to heed the request of what looked to be a united bunch, and a decision was made allowing the race to begin imminently.</p>\n<p>Once the start was given the race quickly got up to speed and launched around 28 kilometres from the finish line in Berga. Race organisers confirmed that GC times would be taken at 5 kilometres to go and that no time bonuses would be available on the finish line, to ensure the safety of the riders, so a stage win was all that was up for grabs, and as such, a number of hopefuls set out their stall to try and take something from the race.</p>\n<p>A trio of riders pulled clear of the bunch on the long descent, comprising Frank van den Broek (Team Picnic-PostNL), Remy Rochas (Groupama-FDJ) and Carlos Verona (Lidl-Trek). They were later joined by Diego Uriarte (Equipo Kern Pharma), but the bunch organised themselves shortly afterwards and collected first Rochas and Uriarte, before finally closing down the leading duo of Verona and van den Broek with ten kilometres left to race.</p>\n<p>With just under 5 kilometres remaining the road kicked up, offering a launchpad for attacks, with a number of riders firing off to try and gain a march on the sprinters. But it was Simmons whose explosive attack heading into the final kilometre stuck, his late turn of pace enough to stay clear of the rampaging bunch who were closing in behind.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Tour du Bocage has gone from a simple race to a federal race recognized as a local event that seduces partners, the public and elected officials. Over the years the sporting level has continued to increase, which is why in 2016 with the support of the Communaut√© de Communes de l&#8217;Ern√©e, the Cyclo Club Ern√©en and the Club Cycliste Landivysien joined the organization to allow greater development. Participating in the promotion of the territory in a sustainable way: the Tour du Bocage and Ern√©e 53 is created. It is fought in 3 stages spread over a weekend. For 2024 the level increases but the format does not change, the TBE 53 is always 3 stages divided into 1 weekend with a CLM per individual on Sunday morning and a peloton of about 175 junior riders. In addition, it is also more than 200 volunteers who get involved all weekend and the meeting with the Mayen public who throughout the course celebrate the passage of runners with passion.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15748&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=15748&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is run typically in late March over five days in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.</p>\n<p>Ben Tulett (Visma-Lease a Bike) won stage 4 of the Settimana Internazionale Coppi e Bartali stage race in Italy, attacking alone on the final climb to gain enough time to snatch the overall race lead.</p>\n<p>The British rider got away with the USA&#8217;s Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers) and Mark Donovan (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) on the steep Valico Rio Chi√® climb but finished alone to set up overall success on Friday&#8217;s stage.</p>\n<p>Tulett finished five seconds ahead of Igor Arrieta (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), with Donovan third at seven seconds. Sheffield, who started the day as race leader, reportedly crashed on the last descent. He finished more than three minutes down on Tulett but was given just a 15-second time gap after the crash ocurred in the final kilometres of the stage. Tulett now leads Donovan by 18 seconds, with Sheffield third at 22 seconds and Arrieta moving to fourth overall at 23 seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutted for Magnus Sheffield who crashed in the closing kilometres of stage four. The Grenadier had been well placed over the day&#8217;s final categorised climb. Happily he was able to re-mount and finish the stage,&#8221; the Ineos team reported on X after the finish.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 150.4km fourth stage looped around the town of Brisighella, covering the 2.6km Monticino climb three times before a switch to a different circuit that included the climbs of Monticino and the Valico Rio Chi√®, before a rising finish in Brisighella.</p>\n<p>Paul Double (Team Jayco AlUla) was the first to attack, keen to make amends for losing time and any GC ambitions on stage 3. Other attacks came and soon a 13-rider group eventually formed and opened a two-minute gap.</p>\n<p>In the move were Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-QuickStep), Paul Double (Jayco AlUla), Ugo Fabries (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Walter Calzoni (Q36.5 Pro Cycling), Davide Baldaccini (Team Solution Tech-Vini Fantini), Germ√°n Dar√≠o G√≥mez (Team Polti VisitMalta), Martin Marcellusi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®), Kamiel Eeman (Lotto), Adrien Maire (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Marc Cabedo (JCL Team UKYO), Luca Cretti (MBH Bank Ballan CSB) and Federico Guzzo (S.C. Padovani Polo Cherry Bank).</p>\n<p>The Visma-Lease a Bike squad led the chase after the second climb of Monticino, and the gap was down to just 45 seconds after 100km of racing. Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep) and Alberto Bettiol (XDS Astana Team) jumped across to the attack and soon after Rafal Majka (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Jarno Widar (Lotto Development) joined them.</p>\n<p>Majka, Widar and Vansevenant immediately went on the attack and opened a 25-second gap in the rolling hills near Brisighella. However the race came back together on the last assault of the steep Valico Rio Chi√® climb.</p>\n<p>Tulett led over the climb but Sheffield and Donovan were initially with him, Sheffield trying to defend his overall race lead.</p>\n<p>A lack of live television footage made it difficult to understand exactly what happened on the descent, but Tulett emerged in the final kilometres to Brisighella and had time to celebrate his first win since the 2023 Tour of Norway. After a series of set-backs, the British climber is back to his best.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world.</p>\n<p>Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) sprinted to his second stage at the Volta a Catalunya from a reduced bunch after crosswinds split the peloton on stage 5.</p>\n<p>Brennan displayed his dominance once again in the final sprint in Amposta. Behind him, in the absence of Kaden Groves, Tibor Del Grosso came through in second for Alpecin-Deceuninck. Picnic-PostNL‚Äôs Pavel Bittner rounded out the podium in third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked all day, and we knew this would be a little bit hectic coming into the final,&#8221; Brennan said after the stage. &#8220;I think the whole team was there, and we pressed on and really managed our effort. We came into the finish in a good position. And I&#8217;m so happy that I could finish off for them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really nice that Stevie [Kruijswijk] was working for me all day. That gives you that extra bit of motivation to really want to finish it off strong. I think the fact that all the guys were really motivated to get to the finish for GC as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we all did such a good job. And motivation-wise, it&#8217;s so nice when your whole team is around you, and there&#8217;s not many of you left. So I&#8217;m really happy with the guys.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last two days have been pretty tough, and it&#8217;s been quite challenging at times. But I think with the sprint, it also gives the team the motivation to go for something a little bit different, as well as the GC days, but it also helps Simon [Yates], Wilco [Kelderman], just stay up front and be there in those hectic moments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An intermediate sprint subplot during the stage saw Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) retake the leader‚Äôs jersey heading into the final weekend, where the GC contenders will once again do battle on a summit finish at Queralt and the traditional closing circuits in Montju√Øc Park.</p>\n<p>Tirreno-Adriatico champion Ayuso snatched a single bonus second to edge into the lead, just a second ahead of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) heading into the decisive final weekend of the race. Enric Mas (Movistar) remains third in the overall standings, 21 seconds off the lead and one up on Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>Beginning in Pa√ºls, just a few kilometres inland from Spain&#8217;s north-west coast, stage 5 of the Volta Catalunya featured a front-loaded profile, with the lion&#8217;s share of the day&#8217;s climbing taking place within the first half of the course.</p>\n<p>This set up a stage that would potentially bring the fast men to the fore for a final bunch sprint opportunity of the race, ahead of a decisive final weekend of GC action. At 172km in total, the only categorised climb of the day was tackled after just 35km, but it was the wind conditions that were of primary concern as the day progressed.</p>\n<p>It took 10km for the day&#8217;s early break to detach themselves from the main peloton; the group was composed of seven riders, but they were never given much breathing room by a motivated bunch, with the threat of strong crosswinds ensuring that the pace stayed high throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The gap to the front of the race dipped below a minute with 82km remaining on the day, as the race travelled south, parallel to the coast along exposed roads.</p>\n<p>The lead group were almost collected by the bunch with more than 60km left and splintered under the pressure, dropping to just two riders, who were allowed to rebuild a small gap, which grew out to over a minute with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>The pair ‚Äì Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ) and Jokin Murguialday (Euskatel-Euskadi) ‚Äì rode together for a while, before Paleni dropped his breakaway companion to head up the road chasing a solo victory.</p>\n<p>Paleni maintained a gap of around 30 seconds until the second intermediate sprint of the day, where an acceleration in the bunch saw Ayuso and Rogliƒç sprint for the remaining bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard snatched a single second, taking the virtual lead in the general classification in the process. With that, Paleni&#8217;s attack was neutralised and the group was compact with just over 20km remaining to the finish.</p>\n<p>From there, the expected crosswinds struck, and with a number of teams driving on at the front of the bunch, the peloton stretched and fractured into several groups, with a reduced group heading onto the lengthy 11km finishing straight with an advantage of around 15 seconds over the remainder of the bunch.</p>\n<p>The gap grew, ensuring that the day&#8217;s winner would come from the front group, and any GC hopefuls caught out in the second group would sustain a serious dent to their challenge.</p>\n<p>As the finish line in Amposta approached, Axel Laurance (Ineos Grenadiers) was first to open his sprint, 250 metres from the line, but he was overpowered by a number of other riders, including Brennan, whose ferocious turn of pace was enough for him to win comfortably. He takes the lead in the points competition with two stages remaining.</p>\n<p>In the battle for the overall classification, clever riding from Ayuso, who had gone into the day second in the GC but on the same time at Rogliƒç, saw him wrest the leader&#8217;s jersey and control of the race back from Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe heading into the queen stage tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Lennert van Eetvelt (Lotto), Matthew Riccitello (Israel-Premier-Tech) and Juan Pedro Lopez (Lidl-Trek) were among the top GC names caught out in the second group, effectively seeing their tilt at the overall win come to a premature end.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world.</p>\n<p>Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) sprinted to his second stage at the Volta a Catalunya from a reduced bunch after crosswinds split the peloton on stage 5.</p>\n<p>Brennan displayed his dominance once again in the final sprint in Amposta. Behind him, in the absence of Kaden Groves, Tibor Del Grosso came through in second for Alpecin-Deceuninck. Picnic-PostNL‚Äôs Pavel Bittner rounded out the podium in third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked all day, and we knew this would be a little bit hectic coming into the final,&#8221; Brennan said after the stage. &#8220;I think the whole team was there, and we pressed on and really managed our effort. We came into the finish in a good position. And I&#8217;m so happy that I could finish off for them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really nice that Stevie [Kruijswijk] was working for me all day. That gives you that extra bit of motivation to really want to finish it off strong. I think the fact that all the guys were really motivated to get to the finish for GC as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we all did such a good job. And motivation-wise, it&#8217;s so nice when your whole team is around you, and there&#8217;s not many of you left. So I&#8217;m really happy with the guys.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The last two days have been pretty tough, and it&#8217;s been quite challenging at times. But I think with the sprint, it also gives the team the motivation to go for something a little bit different, as well as the GC days, but it also helps Simon [Yates], Wilco [Kelderman], just stay up front and be there in those hectic moments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>An intermediate sprint subplot during the stage saw Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) retake the leader‚Äôs jersey heading into the final weekend, where the GC contenders will once again do battle on a summit finish at Queralt and the traditional closing circuits in Montju√Øc Park.</p>\n<p>Tirreno-Adriatico champion Ayuso snatched a single bonus second to edge into the lead, just a second ahead of Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) heading into the decisive final weekend of the race. Enric Mas (Movistar) remains third in the overall standings, 21 seconds off the lead and one up on Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep).</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>Beginning in Pa√ºls, just a few kilometres inland from Spain&#8217;s north-west coast, stage 5 of the Volta Catalunya featured a front-loaded profile, with the lion&#8217;s share of the day&#8217;s climbing taking place within the first half of the course.</p>\n<p>This set up a stage that would potentially bring the fast men to the fore for a final bunch sprint opportunity of the race, ahead of a decisive final weekend of GC action. At 172km in total, the only categorised climb of the day was tackled after just 35km, but it was the wind conditions that were of primary concern as the day progressed.</p>\n<p>It took 10km for the day&#8217;s early break to detach themselves from the main peloton; the group was composed of seven riders, but they were never given much breathing room by a motivated bunch, with the threat of strong crosswinds ensuring that the pace stayed high throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The gap to the front of the race dipped below a minute with 82km remaining on the day, as the race travelled south, parallel to the coast along exposed roads.</p>\n<p>The lead group were almost collected by the bunch with more than 60km left and splintered under the pressure, dropping to just two riders, who were allowed to rebuild a small gap, which grew out to over a minute with 50km to go.</p>\n<p>The pair ‚Äì Enzo Paleni (Groupama-FDJ) and Jokin Murguialday (Euskatel-Euskadi) ‚Äì rode together for a while, before Paleni dropped his breakaway companion to head up the road chasing a solo victory.</p>\n<p>Paleni maintained a gap of around 30 seconds until the second intermediate sprint of the day, where an acceleration in the bunch saw Ayuso and Rogliƒç sprint for the remaining bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard snatched a single second, taking the virtual lead in the general classification in the process. With that, Paleni&#8217;s attack was neutralised and the group was compact with just over 20km remaining to the finish.</p>\n<p>From there, the expected crosswinds struck, and with a number of teams driving on at the front of the bunch, the peloton stretched and fractured into several groups, with a reduced group heading onto the lengthy 11km finishing straight with an advantage of around 15 seconds over the remainder of the bunch.</p>\n<p>The gap grew, ensuring that the day&#8217;s winner would come from the front group, and any GC hopefuls caught out in the second group would sustain a serious dent to their challenge.</p>\n<p>As the finish line in Amposta approached, Axel Laurance (Ineos Grenadiers) was first to open his sprint, 250 metres from the line, but he was overpowered by a number of other riders, including Brennan, whose ferocious turn of pace was enough for him to win comfortably. He takes the lead in the points competition with two stages remaining.</p>\n<p>In the battle for the overall classification, clever riding from Ayuso, who had gone into the day second in the GC but on the same time at Rogliƒç, saw him wrest the leader&#8217;s jersey and control of the race back from Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe heading into the queen stage tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Lennert van Eetvelt (Lotto), Matthew Riccitello (Israel-Premier-Tech) and Juan Pedro Lopez (Lidl-Trek) were among the top GC names caught out in the second group, effectively seeing their tilt at the overall win come to a premature end.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The closest on GC was Embret Svestad-B√•rdseng (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) at 2:50, who moved into the virtual lead for a time. </p>\n<p>The group splintered on the first of the day‚Äôs two categorised climbs, however, with Georg Steinhauser (EF Education-EasyPost) and Johannes Staune-Mittet (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) able to push clear and maintain a lead of around 3:45 over the peloton on the long descent that followed.</p>\n<p>Conditions were dry in north-eastern Spain and the pace was brisk, with a 43 kph average across the stage. The wind also had a part to play, with the peloton briefly divided in a crosswind section, as those at the front of the bunch worked to draw back the leading duo of Steinhauser and Staune-Mittet.</p>\n<p>The duo continued to move further away from the chasing group of 10, though they were slowly beginning to lose time over the peloton.

With 20 kilometres to go, Soudal-QuickStep added their weight to the chase and shortly after, the gap dropped below two minutes for the first time.</p>\n<p>The final climb to Montserrat represented a stern test, 9 kilometres in length and with an average gradient of 6%. As it began, the peloton had trimmed the gap down to just over a minute. Steinhauser took matters into his own hands, launching a move away from Staune-Mittet, while Soudal-QuickStep set the tempo on the early part of the climb on behalf of Mikel Landa.</p>\n<p>As the climb progressed, UAE sent Marc Soler to the front and they began to eat into Steinhauser‚Äôs lead, and drop a significant portion of the bunch in the process. When Adam Yates took over with 3km remaining the group slimmed down once again, with just 12 riders still in contention. </p>\n<p>Shortly after that, the race leader Juan Ayuso launched, and Steinhauser‚Äôs day was done, despite determined resistance from the German.

Coming into the final 600 metres, the two looked at one another, allowing the chasing group of GC contenders to pull them back into close proximity. </p>\n<p>A further acceleration from the Slovenian initiated a second two-up sprint between the pair, and this time, Rogliƒç was able to hold off his young rival, and take control of the race lead in the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

A lengthy ascent at 21 kilometres, though not overly challenging at an average gradient of 5%, UAE used the climb to begin the process of whittling down the bunch, setting a steady but brisk pace that began to see riders losing touch at the back.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, at the front of the race, Bruno Armirail (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale) pushed clear of the breakaway group to go into the solo lead. As Lotto took up the chase on behalf of Lennert van Eetvelt, Armirail slowly improved his advantage, building a cushion of three minutes as he neared the summit, which offered a stunning vista in the snow as the race reached almost 2,000 metres above sea level.</p>\n<p>UAE exerted their authority once more and began to reel him in on the long descent that followed, with the gap dropping to just over a minute as Armirail reached the foot of the final climb up to La Molina. </p>\n<p>Former race leader Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) lost touch as the final climb began in earnest, and a slimmed-down bunch of around 50 riders caught and passed Armirail and pushed on.</p>\n<p>Brennan&#8217;s teammate Sepp Kuss was the first to really open up a gap on the climb, with Ben O&#8217;Connor (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale), who won in La Molina back in 2022, on his wheel.

So hopefully come again next year!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 104th edition of the Volta a Catalunya continued Tuesday with a stage start in Banyoles, and headed 177.3 kilometres north to Figueres, via two categorised climbs. Though there were a few showers early on, the conditions were significantly better than stage 1, with the peloton enjoying sunshine and blue skies as the day progressed.</p>\n<p>A three-man breakaway pulled clear of the bunch immediately after flag drop, consisting of three Spanish continental team riders ‚Äì Calum Johnston (Team Caja Rural-RGA), Diego Uriarte (Equipo Kern Pharma) and Danny van der Tuuk (Euskatel-Euskadi), who was defending the mountain classification jersey. </p>\n<p>They enjoyed a gap of around four minutes early in the stage, but this was reduced to under half a minute on the day‚Äôs main climbing challenge, the category 1 Coll de Sant Pere de Rodes, which greeted the bunch 87km from the stage finish.</p>\n<p>The peloton were led up the climb by Sepp Kuss, riding on behalf of Brennan, which suggested the race leader was feeling good once again, following his immense victory on stage 1. Alpecin-Deceuninck also contributed to the work at the head of the bunch on the climb, affirming their belief in Kaden Groves for the finish despite the more testing nature of the ascent. </p>\n<p>With just two riders remaining in the break, Mario Aparicio (Burgos Burpellet BH) bridged across and sprinted up the road to claim the full 10 points in the KOM competition, before all three riders were caught on the descent that followed.</p>\n<p>At the intermediate sprint point with 68km remaining, Jan Tratnik launched a determined lead-out for Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, but communication appeared to breakdown and the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe effort was curtailed just prior to the line, allowing Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to cruise through and benefit from three additional seconds to add to his total.</p>\n<p>The pace picked up, splitting the peloton heading into the first passage of the finish line on a finish circuit, with tension high at the front of the bunch, and a large group found themselves adrift of the main peloton, forming an echelon in strong crosswinds. Everything came back together some while later though, and there was a moment‚Äôs calm as the parcours steepened. </p>\n<p>A trio of riders made an attempt to get away from the bunch but their efforts were thwarted. In the end, it was a clean run-in toward Figueres for the peloton, who set the stage for a bunch sprint finale.</p>\n<p>Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale and Alpecin-Deceuninck were prominent heading into the final kilometre, but Groves adopted the inside line heading around the final bend and he looked to have the edge, though Laurance kept pace alongside him. </p>\n<p>Vernon timed his effort to perfection, however, moving past the pair to take his first victory of 2025. Brennan took advantage of Vernon‚Äôs speed, following his wheel and launching late, but though he finished fast, it wasn‚Äôt quite enough for a second consecutive victory at the race. He retains the race lead heading into stage 3, with Groves in second and Tibor Del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck) third.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

So yeah, I think we&#8217;ve got a lot of stages and hopefully a fairly good GC result for a couple of guys.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI&#8217;m starting to like this race. It&#8217;s bringing some good memories. So hopefully come again next year!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 104th edition of the Volta a Catalunya continued Tuesday with a stage start in Banyoles, and headed 177.3 kilometres north to Figueres, via two categorised climbs. Though there were a few showers early on, the conditions were significantly better than stage 1, with the peloton enjoying sunshine and blue skies as the day progressed.</p>\n<p>A three-man breakaway pulled clear of the bunch immediately after flag drop, consisting of three Spanish continental team riders ‚Äì Calum Johnston (Team Caja Rural-RGA), Diego Uriarte (Equipo Kern Pharma) and Danny van der Tuuk (Euskatel-Euskadi), who was defending the mountain classification jersey. </p>\n<p>They enjoyed a gap of around four minutes early in the stage, but this was reduced to under half a minute on the day‚Äôs main climbing challenge, the category 1 Coll de Sant Pere de Rodes, which greeted the bunch 87km from the stage finish.</p>\n<p>The peloton were led up the climb by Sepp Kuss, riding on behalf of Brennan, which suggested the race leader was feeling good once again, following his immense victory on stage 1. Alpecin-Deceuninck also contributed to the work at the head of the bunch on the climb, affirming their belief in Kaden Groves for the finish despite the more testing nature of the ascent. </p>\n<p>With just two riders remaining in the break, Mario Aparicio (Burgos Burpellet BH) bridged across and sprinted up the road to claim the full 10 points in the KOM competition, before all three riders were caught on the descent that followed.</p>\n<p>At the intermediate sprint point with 68km remaining, Jan Tratnik launched a determined lead-out for Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, but communication appeared to breakdown and the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe effort was curtailed just prior to the line, allowing Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) to cruise through and benefit from three additional seconds to add to his total.</p>\n<p>The pace picked up, splitting the peloton heading into the first passage of the finish line on a finish circuit, with tension high at the front of the bunch, and a large group found themselves adrift of the main peloton, forming an echelon in strong crosswinds. Everything came back together some while later though, and there was a moment‚Äôs calm as the parcours steepened. </p>\n<p>A trio of riders made an attempt to get away from the bunch but their efforts were thwarted. In the end, it was a clean run-in toward Figueres for the peloton, who set the stage for a bunch sprint finale.</p>\n<p>Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale and Alpecin-Deceuninck were prominent heading into the final kilometre, but Groves adopted the inside line heading around the final bend and he looked to have the edge, though Laurance kept pace alongside him. </p>\n<p>Vernon timed his effort to perfection, however, moving past the pair to take his first victory of 2025. Brennan took advantage of Vernon‚Äôs speed, following his wheel and launching late, but though he finished fast, it wasn‚Äôt quite enough for a second consecutive victory at the race. He retains the race lead heading into stage 3, with Groves in second and Tibor Del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck) third.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is run typically in late March over five days in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.</p>\n<p>Caleb Ewan sprinted to his first victory in Ineos Grenadiers colours on the opening stage of the Settimana Coppi e Bartali, sprinting to an easy win at the end of the 174.5km stage to Bondeno.</p>\n<p>The Australian, logging his first race day for the British team following a move from Jayco-AlUla over the winter, received a perfect lead-out from his teammates, who had controlled the race for much of the day.</p>\n<p>What was the 64th victory of his career came well clear of Oded Kogut (Israel-Premier Tech) and Jason Tesson (TotalEnergies), who only just about managed to clear the Ineos lead-out Ben Swift in the sprint.</p>\n<p>Ewan will now don the first leader‚Äôs green-and-red jersey of the race heading into the hilly 164km second stage to Sogliano al Rubicone on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The stage, a pan-flat run from Ferrara to Bondeno, marked the opening of the race&#8217;s 40th edition. At the start of the day, a five-man break ventured out into the lead.</p>\n<p>Carlos Samudio (Solution Tech-Vini Fantini) was joined in the move by Baptiste Huyet (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Kevin Pezzo Rosola (General Store-Essegibi-F.Lli Curia), Matteo Zurlo (SC Padovani Polo Cherry Bank), and Dominik Amann (Vorarlberg).</p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, Ineos Grenadiers took control at the front, limiting the break&#8217;s advantage to two minutes.</p>\n<p>The stage was all flat, barring a 100-metre hill coming after 36km. The day&#8217;s only challenge would provide the first mountain classification leader of the race, with Pezzo Rosola leading the break across the line to take a single point and with it the green jersey overnight.</p>\n<p>The remainder of the day provided little action, with the break racing up the road with a solid two-minute gap to the peloton. That advantage only started to come down within the final 40km when Israel-Premier Tech and Jayco-AlUla joined Ineos at the front of the peloton.</p>\n<p>At 30km to go, at the second passage of the finish line, the break held an advantage of 1:20 on the peloton, with TotalEnergies and VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√® also joining the fray in the chase.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Pezzo Rosola, his job for the day already done, dropped back to the peloton to leave four men out front. In his absence, the gap to the chase group fell under a minute as the race hit the final 20km.</p>\n<p>Amann was the next to drop back with 16km to run, though at that point TotalEnergies had reduced the gap to 15 seconds. 4km later, the break was finished, with Zurlo lasting a touch longer than his companions.</p>\n<p>The final 5km saw Ineos back on the front, while Israel-Premier Tech, Soudal-QuickStep, and UAE Team Emirates-XRG also organised themselves for the final.</p>\n<p>None of the teams could hold a candle to Ineos in the final run to the line, however, with the squad once again taking control at the front with an organised lead-out train to deliver Ewan to the line. The 30-year-old had no rivals in the sprint finish, blasting home well clear of anyone else to score a dominant victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=114&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First held in 1911, the Volta a Catalunya is the fourth-oldest still-existing cycling stage race in the world.</p>\n<p>19-year-old Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease a Bike) won his first WorldTour level race and took his second pro victory in the space of just five days on stage 1 of the Volta a Catalunya, with an immense display of power to overcome a late breakaway attempt by Tibor Del Grosso (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>In soaking wet conditions on the first day of the week-long race in northeastern Spain, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe set a stringent pace heading into the final 30 kilometres and shredded the bunch, and though a sprint was expected at the beginning of the day, few fast men remained as the reduced peloton approached the finish in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols. </p>\n<p>Del Grosso attacked on the descent with two kilometres remaining but ran out of energy just short of the line, as Brennan powered past him with Del Grosso‚Äôs teammate ‚Äì who the team had been riding for all day ‚Äì Kaden Groves, unable to come past him.</p>\n<p>Brennan takes the early lead on GC for the Dutch team, who will likely switch focus to supporting Simon Yates once the more mountainous terrain begins. Groves finished second and Del Grosso third, on a frustrating day for Alpecin-Deceuninck.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The weather made it quite tricky today. We did everything we could to try and keep the position towards the front and minimise any losses, so we came into the finish, we knew the coast road would be a critical point in the bike race, and I managed to get in position with a few guys around me, they supported me into there and from there we managed to sprint,&#8221; said Brennan. </p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end, it was such a tricky situation to manage, you just had to go full gas really and I‚Äôm so happy it ended up like this, so big thanks to everyone involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was sat watching [last year‚Äôs stage] last night, and as soon as Alpecin went off the front I knew this was a replay from last year, and you‚Äôve just got to really manage it and take responsibility and it ended up the best we probably could have done, in that scenario.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong></p>\n<p>The 2025 edition of the Volta a Catalunya began with a lumpy circuit of 178.6 kilometres beginning and ending in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, with the peloton taking on a large loop heading up the coast and inland, followed by a shorter loop. The profile featured two third-category climbs, with barely any flat along the parcours, and would conclude with a steep ramp up to the finish line.</p>\n<p>The race rolled out in bright sunshine but it wasn‚Äôt long before clouds gathered and rain jackets were donned as the weather took a turn for the worse. </p>\n<p>A four-man breakaway group was quickly established but was kept on a short leash, amassing no more than a 2:30 lead which diminished heading into the latter half of the day‚Äôs racing.</p>\n<p>With the break in their sights, the peloton took the long descent with caution in the wet conditions, and eventually subsumed the four-man lead group just prior to the first passage of the finish line. </p>\n<p>From there, despite an attack from a pair of riders from Lotto and Groupama-FDJ which was quickly snuffed out, the group remained compact as they covered the remaining kilometres, the wet road surface likely contributing to the lack of interest in any long-range attacks. </p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck controlled the pace on behalf of their sprinter, Groves, though it was Enric Mas of Movistar who put his nose in the wind to snatch the three-second bonus at the final intermediate sprint of the day.</p>\n<p>The pace began to increase with around 30 kilometres remaining in the stage, with INEOS Grenadiers, Movistar and UAE Team Emirates-XRG joining the charge at the head of the bunch. </p>\n<p>Ten kilometres later, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe took over, protecting their leader Primo≈æ Rogliƒç in his second race of the 2025 season. The rain continued to fall and the peloton split under the brisk pace set by the German team, with Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike) among the riders dropped from the main group, which diminished in size to around 40 riders as they entered the final descent down to the finish line.</p>\n<p>With two kilometres to go, Del Grosso clipped off the front of the bunch catching everyone else sleeping, and the 21-year-old used his exceptional descending skills to build a seemingly unassailable gap over the rest of the group. </p>\n<p>But with the final kicker up to the finish line to contend with, it quickly became clear that Brennan and Groves were closing in on the rapidly fading Del Grosso. With the Dutchman struggling, Brennan charged past just metres from the finish line to deny the U23 cyclocross world champion from taking what would have been his first World Tour victory, taking his own in the process.</p>\n<p>A number of GC favourites were able to survive the ferocious tempo though there are already a few notable names who lost time, including Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike) and Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Team Jayco-AlUla) who all sit 25 seconds down on Brennan‚Äôs leading time and 18 seconds down on the best-placed GC rider Mas after the opener.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=14&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the race usually starts with a prologue in the Paris region and ends with a final stage either in Nice or on the Col d&#8217;√àze overlooking the city. The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C√¥te d&#8217;Azur.[2] The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. </p>\n<p>The sun shone brightly on two US riders on the final day of Paris-Nice, with Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers) winning stage 8 in Nice and compatriot Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) finishing second to secure the GC victory.</p>\n<p>Sheffield launched a solo attack on the brutal Col des Quatre Chemins climb with 12.5km to go, having dropped Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) in the process, the Dane the most active rider in his quest to secure the sprint classification award. It was an emotional victory for Sheffield, who earned his first major WorldTour victory.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Jorgenson matched many attacks on the 119.9km day of climbing, eventually making his way to the lead chase group, and using the fast descent into Nice to cross the line 29 seconds behind Sheffield.</p>\n<p>Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) completed the stage podium in third, 26 seconds ahead of a group of six chasers, which included Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), who fought to hold on to second overall.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson made it back-to-back GC titles at the Race to the Sun, this time with a margin of 1:15 over Lipowitz and 1:58 over Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers). Sheffield&#8217;s powerful ride moved him two spots in the GC, and he finished 19 seconds behind his Ineos teammate for fourth overall.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson later described his final day in the saddle at Paris-Nice as &#8220;a relief&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about this week for the past four months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just a lot of stress coming off now. It&#8217;s nice to do it [win] and know I did everything I could. It worked out,&#8221; the two-time winner said at the finish to broadcasters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I credit my team, really. I was so well-supported this week. Today, I was pretty isolated and I knew that would be the case in the mountains. But the rest of the week we took full advantage of really having a strong team on the flats, and tactically and positioning.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone was committed from day one, and that feels really good. I am so happy to be on this team. And I&#8217;ve won Paris-Nice two years in a row &#8211; that&#8217;s crazy to say that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Jorgenson smiled and laughed during his post-race interview, Sheffield, three years his junior at just 22, became teary-eyed during his comments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really unbelievable. I&#8217;ve been second so many times now. It&#8217;s my first victory at the WorldTour level. It means so much,&#8221; Sheffield said before the podium ceremony to organisers, getting emotional at the realisation of his win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just so hard to win any race. It means really so much. Today, I think we made a really good plan on the bus. We didn&#8217;t give up. We tried to use the guys on that first climb, we continued with the pace and we had the numbers [over the climbs] so it was about playing our cards right.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Matteo was isolated, Lipowitz was isolated. So I told the boys that I would go to the back and then I would attack and not look back. I was able to get across to Mads [Pedersen] and I knew I was stronger than him on the climb, so I had to use him as best that I could.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the descent and final stretch with a solo lead, he said he had some issues with his gears, and began to worry about any chasers making the catch until he saw the final banner, feeling &#8220;so happy and relieved to cross the finish line first&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA blue sky illuminated the start of stage 8 at Paris-Nice, after being reluctant to shine all week. The start in Nice began uphill for the opening 50km from the serene Mediterranean setting for a first of three category 1 climbs, Col de la Porte (7km at 7.2%). Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) was the first rider to test the peloton with a couple of charges at the front in the opening 20km, both attacks quickly closed down.</p>\n<p>Just 12km into the proceedings, Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) dropped back and a few kilometres later he gave up his seventh position in GC when he dismounted and did not continue, the US rider having been ill the last few days. Also pulling out was Adrien Petit (Inermarch√©-Wanty) and Max Walker (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>As the long approach to the Col de la Porte continued, multiple riders took brief flyers at the front, including Julian Alaphilippe (Tudor) and another try by Pedersen. Then a move finally stuck with</p>\n<p>Matteo Sobrero (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates), Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) and Georg Steinhauser (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>With 81km to go, on a small descent leading to the base of the final ascent to Col de la Porte, Steinhauser dropped Narvaez and Pedersen, but the Lidl-Trek rider decided to counter and it was the Dane who grabbed his own daylight, carving out a 15-second advantage quickly. But again, the peloton brought Pedersen back in the fold another 5km on.</p>\n<p>Once across the crest of the climb, who took off again on the twisty descent? Pedersen again. His aggressiveness was rewarded with a 25-second advantage once reaching the base of the descent and with 55km to go was away by 1:15.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of the C√¥te de Peille (6.5km, 6.9%) with less than 50km to race, Aleksandr Vlasov (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AlUla) gave chase.</p>\n<p>In the peloton, Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers) made a move with Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). GC leader Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) matched the attacks as Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) also joined the party. They caught Vlasov and O&#8217;Connor, with Jorgenson taking up the pacemaking on the climb which would fragment the peloton behind.</p>\n<p>Near the top of the climb, Pedersen had Vlasov and Gall for company, holding a slight 20-second gap over the yellow jersey group of chasers. Next on the to-do list was a quest for the intermediate sprint points on the banks of the 13% gradient of Col d&#8217;Eze, and with help now from two riding companions, Pedersen looked to secure the points jersey for good.</p>\n<p>Foss led the chase group, a solid group with yellow jersey Jorgenson, Arensman, Sheffield, Lipowitz, Harold Tejada and Cl√©ment Champoussin (XDS-Astana), Michael Storer (Tudor), Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), Ilan Van Wilder (Soudal-QuickStep) and a handful of other riders.</p>\n<p>With 34km to go, Sheffield left the chase group behind and set off to catch the leading trio. The peloton was more than 3 minutes back of the action, and two riders with Soudal-QuickStep, Tim Merlier and Bert Van Lerberghe, called it a day and abandoned.</p>\n<p>Using a massive effort, Sheffield caught the leaders and pulled the lead group towards the intermediate sprint, with Pedersen taking the points to confirm the sprint classification title for the race. Pedersen and Sheffield then attacked at the front. Jorgenson joined Vlasov and Gall for the chase with 25km to go.</p>\n<p>The third and final category 1 challenge at Col des Quatre Chemins (3.6% at 8.8%) loomed, with Pedersen getting out of the saddle several times to maintain top speed and usher his companion Sheffield on the descent to the base of the climb, holding 15 seconds on the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>Once on the narrow climb and 12.5km to go, Sheffield went away solo while Pedersen was soon caught and passed by Jorgenson, Vlasov and Gall. Vlasov dropped back and was joined by Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) and Lipowitz, clad in the white young rider&#8217;s jersey, led what remained of the peloton riding for damage control.</p>\n<p>Sheffield stormed away on the ripping descent with less than 10km to the finish in Nice, while compatriot Jorgenson unhooked himself from Gall and rode a handful of seconds in the chase with his eyes on the overall prize.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=8&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He ended up 36 seconds down on Ayuso.</p>\n<p>Stage honours for the seventh day at the Race of the Two Seas were taken by Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) as the peloton raced home for one final bunch sprint. The Italian sprinted from 200 metres out after a strong lead out from Simone Consonni.</p>\n<p>Milan headed off a late burst by Sam Bennett (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), while Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) rounded out the podium behind the leading duo.</p>\n<p>Further back, a multi-rider crash took out several hopefuls, including Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), and Gijs Leemreize (Picnic-PostNL).</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to get this second victory. I have to say always thanks to my teammates. They did a perfect lead out. It was a bit tough in the climb where I have to say I suffered a bit, but we made it through to the finish line. We are happy,‚Äù Milan said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI also have to say that I‚Äôm sorry that Jasper crashed in the final. It‚Äôs a really bad crash that happened in the last few hundred metres. I hope no-one is really bad.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúBut, all-in-all, for me it was a really good Tirreno. I am really happy that we achieved the second victory after the crash that I had some days ago. Also, in these last two days it wasn‚Äôt super easy for me on the climbs, so I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For Magnier it was his second crash of the stage, first sliding out in a corner with 80km to go, and then hard fall in the closing 100 metres before the finish. His Soudal-QuickStep team issued a statement that the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad runner-up was assessed immediately at the finish and escaped &#8220;with some bruises and road rash&#8221;, and would be examined further on Monday by team doctors. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing Saturday‚Äôs Queen stage, the final stage of Tirreno-Adriatico would be one suited to the sprinters, taking the peloton 147km from Porto Potenza Picena to the traditional finish town of San Benedetto del Tronto.</p>\n<p>The day would bring just one climb, the 8.4km, 4.7% hill at Ripatransone after 57km, while much of the remainder of the stage would be taken up by five laps of the pan-flat 14.6km finishing circuit.</p>\n<p>It would take 10km after the flag dropping for the break of the day to form, with Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) driving the move away from the peloton.</p>\n<p>The former World Champion would be joined out front by K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Lucas Hamilton (Ineos Grenadiers), Bjoern Koerdt (Picnic-PostNL), and mountain classification leader Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers settled into work at the head of the peloton, while up the road, the five-man break raced to a 1:40 lead. The British team, likely eyeing bonus seconds for Filippo Ganna at the day‚Äôs intermediate sprint, ramped up the pace on the approach to Ripatransone, bringing the gap down under 30 seconds as the race hit the climb.</p>\n<p>The hard pace saw much of the break brought back with 96km left to run, though Van der Poel battled on solo with 6km of the climb remaining. He wouldn‚Äôt last to the top, however, as the Ineos-led peloton dragged him back at 92km to go.</p>\n<p>The peloton rolled over the top massed all together, with Ineos still leading the way and 46.4km to race until the group hit the intermediate sprint. Off the rear, sprinters including Olav Kooij and Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco-AlUla) battled to get back on after getting dropped on the climb.</p>\n<p>Ineos continued to lead down the descent and onto the finishing circuit, bringing the peloton to the intermediate sprint. There, the team‚Äôs ploy earlier pair off, with their lead-out delivering Ganna to first place for three bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan took second place, leaving Ganna‚Äôs GC rival Antonio Tiberi in third with one bonus second and boosting Ganna up into second place overall.</p>\n<p>From there, the focus turned to the finishing sprint ‚Äì one reserved for the specialists rather than a battle for seconds among the GC contenders. Teams including Uno-X Mobility, Visma-Lease a Bike, Jayco-AlUla, Israel-Premier Tech, Soudal-QuickStep and Lidl-Trek all flowed to the front during the closing circuits, battling for position ahead of the final kilometres.</p>\n<p>There would be no one team in control once the peloton got there, however. Jayco-AlUla looked the most organised at 2km to go with three men in front of Dylan Groenewegen.</p>\n<p>Ganna came back to the front in time for the final kilometre, putting in one last big effort for the week. He peeled off to leave Consonni and Milan leading through the final chicane and onto the finishing straight.</p>\n<p>Groupama-FDJ were among the teams trying to move up with the US team, while Uno-X and Tudor battled for the spot on Milan‚Äôs wheel. Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech) launched the sprint on the right-hand side of the road, but Consonni took notice and pulled off to let Milan fire.</p>\n<p>Tord Gudmestad was coming up and around Stewart with his Decathlon AG2R teammate Bennett in his wheel, but it wasn‚Äôt to be for the Irishman as Milan had enough in his legs to hold off the late challenge and win again, taking the points classification in the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=7&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) and Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) rounded out the top five.</p>\n<p>Ayuso used a set of three accelerations on the final climb to pass a disintegrating breakaway group of eight riders, drop top contenders and move into the overall race lead ahead of Sunday&#8217;s closing sprint stage in San Benedetto del Tronto.</p>\n<p>Former leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) finished just outside the top 10 at 50 seconds back, allowing him to cling to an overall podium position with one day to race. Ganna dropped to third on GC, 38 seconds behind Ayuso and just one second behind second-placed Tiberi.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We worked really well. The team did an amazing job. The last k or so I suffered a bit but I&#8217;m glad I made it,&#8221; Ayuso said after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the final we knew we had to make it hard. It was quite windy, and on a wheel you could save a lot. I am glad I got on the wheel of [Isaac] Del Toro because I was really suffering on his wheel, but everybody else was [suffering] also.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just went for it and I knew I just had to put in my tempo to the top.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The stage 6 triumph marked the third victory of the 2025 season for Ayuso, having won a pair of one-day races in early March, including Trofeo Laigueglia a week ago.</p>\n<p>With time gained on the mountaintop ascent, Hindley moved from 12th on GC to fifth, while Pidcock moved nine spots to sixth and Landa jumped to seventh. Hindley remained fourth overall, but lost 8 seconds and sits four seconds behind Ganna.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe penultimate stage of Tirreno-Adriatico would be the final chance for the riders battling for the famous Trident trophy to make an impact on the general classification. Stage 6 would take the riders 163km from Cartoceto to Frontignano, a day held on rolling roads aside from the 7.7km, 7.8% summit finish.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from the start of the day, with Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), but a move wouldn&#8217;t go clear until 15km of racing with Van der Poel&#8217;s teammate Gianni Vermeersch lead the aggression.</p>\n<p>Vermeersch was joined in the break by stage 3 winner Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Samuele Battistella (EF Education-EasyPost), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Andrea Pietrobon (Polti-VisitMalta), and Magnus Cort (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>The group of six took an advantage of 2:30 over the hilly early ground of the opening 50km, Ineos Grenadiers commanding a steady pace at the front of the peloton behind.</p>\n<p>Vendrame, who started the day 2:35 behind race leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), moved into the virtual lead by a slim margin as the middle section of the stage commenced, another 50km block before the substantial rise of 5.6km, at 5% average gradient to Crispiero.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL) attacked with 145km to go bridging across to join the front of the race. With just under 100km remaining, the gap moved out to 3:30 for the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Once the leaders pushed the gap out to 4:30 with 80km to go, but the peloton, driven by Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Q36.5, took a little more interest and began to recover some of that time.

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) used a solo attack on the final 3.5km of the Frontignano climb to win stage 6 of Tirreno-Adriatico and take over the race lead.</p>\n<p>From a select group of four chasers, Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) finished second and Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) took third, both 13 seconds back. Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) and Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) rounded out the top five.</p>\n<p>Ayuso used a set of three accelerations on the final climb to pass a disintegrating breakaway group of eight riders, drop top contenders and move into the overall race lead ahead of Sunday&#8217;s closing sprint stage in San Benedetto del Tronto.</p>\n<p>Former leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) finished just outside the top 10 at 50 seconds back, allowing him to cling to an overall podium position with one day to race. Ganna dropped to third on GC, 38 seconds behind Ayuso and just one second behind second-placed Tiberi.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We worked really well. The team did an amazing job. The last k or so I suffered a bit but I&#8217;m glad I made it,&#8221; Ayuso said after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the final we knew we had to make it hard. It was quite windy, and on a wheel you could save a lot. I am glad I got on the wheel of [Isaac] Del Toro because I was really suffering on his wheel, but everybody else was [suffering] also.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I just went for it and I knew I just had to put in my tempo to the top.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The stage 6 triumph marked the third victory of the 2025 season for Ayuso, having won a pair of one-day races in early March, including Trofeo Laigueglia a week ago.</p>\n<p>With time gained on the mountaintop ascent, Hindley moved from 12th on GC to fifth, while Pidcock moved nine spots to sixth and Landa jumped to seventh. Hindley remained fourth overall, but lost 8 seconds and sits four seconds behind Ganna.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe penultimate stage of Tirreno-Adriatico would be the final chance for the riders battling for the famous Trident trophy to make an impact on the general classification. Stage 6 would take the riders 163km from Cartoceto to Frontignano, a day held on rolling roads aside from the 7.7km, 7.8% summit finish.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from the start of the day, with Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), but a move wouldn&#8217;t go clear until 15km of racing with Van der Poel&#8217;s teammate Gianni Vermeersch lead the aggression.</p>\n<p>Vermeersch was joined in the break by stage 3 winner Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Samuele Battistella (EF Education-EasyPost), Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), Andrea Pietrobon (Polti-VisitMalta), and Magnus Cort (Uno-X Mobility).</p>\n<p>The group of six took an advantage of 2:30 over the hilly early ground of the opening 50km, Ineos Grenadiers commanding a steady pace at the front of the peloton behind.</p>\n<p>Vendrame, who started the day 2:35 behind race leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers), moved into the virtual lead by a slim margin as the middle section of the stage commenced, another 50km block before the substantial rise of 5.6km, at 5% average gradient to Crispiero.</p>\n<p>Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis) and Chris Hamilton (Picnic-PostNL) attacked with 145km to go bridging across to join the front of the race. With just under 100km remaining, the gap moved out to 3:30 for the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Once the leaders pushed the gap out to 4:30 with 80km to go, but the peloton, driven by Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Q36.5, took a little more interest and began to recover some of that time. Pietrobon took the five points on offer at the KOM across Crispiero, while the gap for the front group dropped to 3:10.</p>\n<p>The eight riders worked well together as undulating roads steered towards the only intermediate sprint of the day, Pieve Torina, a small town in the Monti Sibillini National Park that signalled the all-out climbing across the final 20km to the summit finish at Frontignano.

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Day-long breakaway rider Fredrik Dversnes (Uno-X Mobility) fended off a shattered peloton to claim a spectacular solo victory on stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico as race leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) suffered a late mechanical and had to complete the stage on a neutral assistance bike.</p>\n<p>Dversnes was the last survivor of a seven-man breakaway, dropping his last companion around a kilometre from the summit of the Monterolo climb, the last of several small but rugged late ascents. He then sped down to the finish in Pergola, keeping the peloton at bay on a series of unforgiving little drags for his first ever WorldTour win, rounding out a whopping 195 kilometres off the front in the best way possible.</p>\n<p>Second leading in a severely reduced bunch mainly containing GC contenders was Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck), 7 seconds after Dversnes, with Roger Adri√† (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) in third.</p>\n<p>Leader Ganna successfully fended off a late downhill attack off the Monterolo spearheaded by Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), only for his late mechanical inside the closing kilometres to leave him trailing home behind the remainder of the GC group.</p>\n<p>However, the Italian was eventually awarded the same time as the group he was in as his issue occurred in the final three kilometres, so he holds onto the blue jersey.</p>\n<p>Asked by the race organisation interview if &#8220;never look back is the basic rule of cycling&#8221;, Dversnes answered, with a laugh, &#8220;Never give up, for sure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d had a pretty hard, cold two days, so with this [much drier] weather today, it turned out to be a good stage. I tried to get in the breakaway and it wasn&#8217;t sure if we&#8217;d get a good gap because of my [high] position in GC but luckily we managed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then in the final climb, I got instructions from my sports director to go all in and fortunately it turned out to be good enough. There was a pretty hard kicker up at a kilometre to go, so I wasn&#8217;t sure if i could win until 500 metres to go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m really happy, it&#8217;s my first WorldTour win, for me it means everything, it&#8217;s for sure the biggest win of my career.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nA very long haul of an unclassified climb opened up the day&#8217;s racing, with Dries de Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) boldly promising reporters at the sign-on he&#8217;d get in the early break and then proving as good as his word as the stage moved out of the town of Ascoli Picena and onto the 20-kilometre ascent.</p>\n<p>A further six riders opted to join the ever-ambitious Belgian on a very hilly stage with nearly 3,500 metres of vertical climbing, but in thankfully much drier conditions than the previous days. Xandro Meurisse and his Slovenian teammate Gal Glivar (Alpecin-Deceunink), Paul Ourselin (Cofidis), Francisco Mu√±oz (Polti-VisitMalta), Fredrik Dversnes (Uno-X Mobility), and mountains classification Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) all made it across to De Bondt and the septet quickly forged a gap of three minutes by the top of the unclassified climb, and putting Dversnes, 1:22 down on race leader Ganna that morning, comfortably into the virtual lead in the process.</p>\n<p>The status quo endured deep into the stage, broken only by news of the abandon of former World Champion Rui Costa (EF Education-EasyPost), the third of EF&#8217;s riders to quit this year&#8217;s Tirreno after James Shaw and Michael Valgren, as well as former U23 World TT Champion Johan Price-Pejtersen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and XDS-Astana&#8217;s star climber Wout Poels. </p>\n<p>By the stage&#8217;s last 100 kilometres, the gap for the seven ahead had ballooned to nearly seven minutes and strengthened initially faint hopes they might outrun the pack altogether. Losing Mu√±oz did not boost their options, though, and after a small unclassified climb, the Barbara, with bonus seconds at the top, Meurisse also fell behind. </p>\n<p>As the stage hung in the balance, the five remaining racers out front ‚Äì Glivar, Ourselin, Dversnes, De Bondt and Tarozzi ‚Äì still had a four minute lead with 40 kilometres to go, sparking alarm bells in the peloton and seeing a pronounced acceleration from UAE Team Emirates-XRG behind.</p>\n<p>Going onto the first of two late climbs, the Salita di Barbanti (6.2km at 4.6%) just before the finish, there was a touch of wheels with Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AIUIa), running seventh on GC, going down hard. The Irishman was initially able to pick himself up, but his grimace of pain as he did so, as well as sitting quickly down again on the side of the road did not bode well and it was later confirmed he&#8217;d abandoned.</p>\n<p>Q36.5 and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe set down a ferocious pace alongside UAE up the Salita di Barbanti, meanwhile, draining down on the weaker elements to leave about 60 in the front group and coinciding with a drop in collaboration in the five ahead. Despite their increasing lack of shared commitment, Tarozzi then gained some more points at the summit to carve out an all but unassailable lead in the mountains ranking and the five flung themselves down a fast, very irregularly surfaced descent to stay ahead for a quick breather prior to the final climbing challenges of the day.</p>\n<p>After the official start of the very uneven final climb, the Monterolo, Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost) quickly reached earlier counter-attacker Nicolas Prodhomme (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) only for fellow Colombian and double Tirreno-Adriatico winner Nairo Quintana (Movistar) briefly to roll back the years with a steady, but short, drive off the front. UAE continued their hard work in the pack to sweep past Quintana and the bulk of a crumbling break, but final survivor Dversnes was  still ahead with 1 kilometre to go to the summit, and holding a 30 second advantage, too. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) surprisingly lost contact after riding a very aggressive race earlier in the week, while Ganna, on the other hand, had no problems handling the searing uphill pace set by UAE, Red Bull and Q36.5&#8217;s Mark Donovan.</p>\n<p>Dversnes swept over the summit of the Monterolo alone, but Ayuso instantly attempted to light things up, followed by Pidcock and Ganna. The Italian was unable to stay with Pidcock when he opened up a 30-metre gap, closely shadowed by Ayuso, and it was only at the bottom that around 30 riders reformed around the GC leader as Ganna definitively snuffed out the Q36.5 leader&#8217;s move.</p>\n<p>Dversnes was in plain sight of what barely qualified as a main peloton, and with every surge sparked by attacks from riders like Pidcock, Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) coming closer and closer, it seemed that his number was up. However, the intense marking by the GC favourites gave the Norwegian just enough of a margin to cross the line in Pergola with a victory to celebrate, while Ganna&#8217;s late mechanical left the Italian cursing his bad luck, but well inside the secure three-kilometres-to-go and with no damage to his overall position. </p>\n<p>The leader since day one, the Italian has defended his lead brilliantly, but Saturday&#8217;s showdown mountain stage could see some major ‚Äì and definitive ‚Äì changes in the overall. Meanwhile Dversnes could celebrate a fairy tale ending to his daring all-day breakaway.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

UAE continued their hard work in the pack to sweep past Quintana and the bulk of a crumbling break, but final survivor Dversnes was  still ahead with 1 kilometre to go to the summit, and holding a 30 second advantage, too. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) surprisingly lost contact after riding a very aggressive race earlier in the week, while Ganna, on the other hand, had no problems handling the searing uphill pace set by UAE, Red Bull and Q36.5&#8217;s Mark Donovan.</p>\n<p>Dversnes swept over the summit of the Monterolo alone, but Ayuso instantly attempted to light things up, followed by Pidcock and Ganna. The Italian was unable to stay with Pidcock when he opened up a 30-metre gap, closely shadowed by Ayuso, and it was only at the bottom that around 30 riders reformed around the GC leader as Ganna definitively snuffed out the Q36.5 leader&#8217;s move.</p>\n<p>Dversnes was in plain sight of what barely qualified as a main peloton, and with every surge sparked by attacks from riders like Pidcock, Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) coming closer and closer, it seemed that his number was up. However, the intense marking by the GC favourites gave the Norwegian just enough of a margin to cross the line in Pergola with a victory to celebrate, while Ganna&#8217;s late mechanical left the Italian cursing his bad luck, but well inside the secure three-kilometres-to-go and with no damage to his overall position. </p>\n<p>The leader since day one, the Italian has defended his lead brilliantly, but Saturday&#8217;s showdown mountain stage could see some major ‚Äì and definitive ‚Äì changes in the overall. Meanwhile Dversnes could celebrate a fairy tale ending to his daring all-day breakaway.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the race usually starts with a prologue in the Paris region and ends with a final stage either in Nice or on the Col d&#8217;√àze overlooking the city. The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C√¥te d&#8217;Azur. The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. </p>\n<p>Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) conquered the steep final climb to win stage 5 of Paris-Nice, powering to victory atop the C√¥te de Notre-Dame-de-Sciez ahead of Cl√©ment Champoussin (XDS Astana).</p>\n<p>Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) set a ferocious pace up the second half of the climb but was just overtaken by an acceleration from Martinez to the line, though the American will take the race lead back from teammate Jonas Vingegaard. The American had to settle for third at the finish.</p>\n<p>It was a bad day for Vingegaard in the yellow jersey after he suffered a seemingly innocuous crash but was then clearly in pain as he struggled to match the GC favourites on the climb and lost a chunk of time as well as the race lead.</p>\n<p>The five tough climbs packed into the final 50km of stage 5 made for a difficult day in France, with a cagey finale before the GC battle exploded on the punishing 11% slopes of the last climb, ushering in a significant reshuffling of the top 10.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson now leads the GC by 22 seconds over Vingegaard, who is still in second, and Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) moved into third, 36 seconds down on Jorgenson. Former third place Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) also struggled on the final climb and is now in sixth, 57 seconds down. Winner Martinez earned himself a move up to fifth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was just incredible,&#8221; Martinez said at the finish, celebrating his first win at WorldTour level.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Everybody did a great job today, and on the final climb, I knew that I wanted to be up there with 150 metres to go, and I had to just go for it.

It‚Äôs incredible, the feeling. To win here in Paris-Nice with my new team is incredible, I‚Äôm super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 5 of Paris-Nice took the peloton Saint-Just-en-Chevalet to La C√¥te-Saint-Andr√© with no fewer than seven categorised climbs on the menu ‚Äì plus some uncategorised ascents ‚Äì and five of the official climbs packed into the final 50km. It all culminated with the tough C√¥te de Notre-Dame-de-Sciez, only 1.7km long but with a demanding 11.1% average gradient.</p>\n<p>The stage started with a pair of climbs, but with a real chance of the breakaway making it to the finish, the peloton were very reluctant to let any threatening riders go, so the battle for the break took a long time under cold, unpleasant conditions.</p>\n<p>After more than 50km, a handful of riders were up the road in disparate groups, and most were caught, but eventually, after two hours, the duo of Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) and Thibaud Gruel (Groupama-FDJ) did manage to secure a slender gap as the peloton seemed to settle down.</p>\n<p>Over the next two climbs, they pulled their lead out to 2:50, stabilising at around 1:45 on the flat, and they held the gap for a good while as Visma-Lease a Bike kept things in check in the peloton.</p>\n<p>A small crash for Vingegaard on an uphill briefly made it look like there might be a problem, but the race leader quickly had three teammates around him, and after a bike change, he was back on the move and back in the bunch. Initially, it looked like Vingegaard was only suffering from a bloody lip, but it became clear throughout the day and at the finish that he was in significant pain.</p>\n<p>The Dane then hovered around the back of the peloton with just one teammate for much of the day as the rest of the squad lined up at the front, protecting  Jorgenson.</p>\n<p><strong>A punchy finale</strong><br />\nThe first of the five back-to-back climbs passed without any attacks, but did take almost a minute out of the leaders‚Äô advantage as things started to ramp up into the finale.</p>\n<p>On the C√¥te de Sibuze, Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) attacked from the peloton and quickly joined his teammate and Gruel in the break. The Norwegian‚Äôs presence clearly helped as they increased their gap back up from 40 seconds to closer to a minute. Three more riders tried to follow Foss‚Äô lead and also bridge the gap, but they were brought back as the peloton chased down the break.</p>\n<p>On the third-last climb, Foss went solo from the break, as Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale set the pace behind going into the final 30km, quickly sweeping up Swift and Gruel. Despite the best efforts of the GC teams ‚Äì albeit without huge input from Visma-Lease a BIke ‚Äì Foss was somehow extending his lead, holding onto 1:15 into the final 20km.</p>\n<p>The peloton kicked into action on the penultimate C√¥te d‚ÄôArzay with various riders trying to go clear. Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) managed to chip off the peloton, but that didn‚Äôt last long as Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Lidl-Trek set a tough pace, sensing some hesitation from Vimsa-Lease a Bike.</p>\n<p>On the flat in the final 10km before the finishing climb, there was no one team putting together a concerted chase, with riders just trying to keep up with the high pace in the whittled-down group. Vingegaard finally moved towards the front of the peloton with 8km to go as Visma eventually kicked into gear.</p>\n<p>Foss was finally caught with 4km to go, setting up for an all-out finale up the C√¥te de Notre-Dame-de-Sciez. Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) put in another monster turn in support of his team leader Skjelmose, pulling off just at the bottom of the climb and allowing Visma to take over.</p>\n<p>Whilst Jorgenson was well-placed, Vingegaard was one of the first GC riders to start to suffer, swaying on the bike and slipping to the back of the group with still some 800m to go. Jorgenson led the race from the front but couldn‚Äôt quite shake off Martinez and Champoussin, with the Bahrain Victorious rider taking off at just the right moment to grab victory on the line.</p>\n<p>With Vingegaard losing time, Jorgenson takes over the race lead from his teammate, a consolation for not winning the stage. Stage 6 is set to be a day for the sprinters, but the American will still have two big climbing days on Saturday and Sunday if he is to defend his title won here in 2024.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) claimed a last-ditch bunch sprint win on a rainsoaked stage 4 of Tirreno-Adriatico, as a severely reduced peloton snapped up the remnants of a day-long break and late attacker Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) agonisingly close to the line.</p>\n<p>Second was Rick Pluimers (Tudor Pro Cycling), with Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) claiming third. Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) retained the overall lead for a fourth straight day.</p>\n<p>A series of splits in the final third of an action-packed 190-kilometre stage from Norcia to Trasacco, including one six-rider GC attack featuring race leader Ganna and key rival Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), all failed to consolidate. Then, however, a dangerous move by Healy with four kilometres to go, scorching across to the remnants of the early break, forced Ineos to chase hard behind.</p>\n<p>Once Healy and co. had been caught almost at the last moment possible, the widely expected bunch sprint finally materialised, but with such a small lead group, it was a very uncontrolled affair.</p>\n<p>Young French sprinter Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep) opened up the dash for the line from fourth in the string and Van der Poel quickly overhauled him. However, Kooij came dashing up on the right-hand side of the group to claim his third win of the season, and first-ever stage victory in Tirreno-Adriatico.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really fought for it,&#8221; Kooij, who had been caught on the wrong side of one of the bigger late splits, said afterwards. &#8220;We set the pace over the main climb and I thought I&#8217;d make it because we kept the break close, but on the plateau, we were surprised a bit by echelons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That set us on the back foot and sometimes I thought we&#8217;d come back, others I didn&#8217;t believe it any more. But the guys did great work and once we were there I knew I had to switch on and go for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sick in the UAE Tour, but second in Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne, Kooij said &#8220;That [illness] was a little setback, but I had a good reset in Kuurne and I was looking forward to this race.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ridden it once before, but I really wanted to win a stage here and I&#8217;m super happy that after a hard fight today, I got it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nDespite looking like a sprinters&#8217; stage on paper, the peloton had barely swung into the collective saddle before they immediately faced a serious test, the 14-kilometre Forca della Civita &#8211; and in a foretaste of what proved to be an entertainingly volatile stage, race leader Ganna was amongst those to try to get away early.</p>\n<p>However, the first break actually to consolidate came thanks to Mark Donovan (Q36.5) and Roger Adri√° (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and the Briton and Catalan had made over the summit of the Forca, only to be reeled, an hour-long period of skirmishing then ensued.</p>\n<p>Such a fraught start all but guaranteed only a strong break would survive and when finally a five-man move containing Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Jorge Arcas (Movistar), Gijs Leemreize (Picnic-PostNL), Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) and William Blume Levy (Uno-X Mobility) emerged, it quickly gained an impressive gap of six minutes as stage 4 headed towards the main, mid-stage ascent of the day, the Valico la Crocetta.</p>\n<p>Rutsch, 1:52 behind Ganna on GC that morning, briefly became race leader on the road, but UAE Team Emirates kept up a strong pace behind though, causing both stage 2 winner Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) and fellow fastman Dylan Groenwegen (Jayco-AUIAa) to end up getting dropped. Not only that, after a long haul up to the summit of Valica la Crocetta, the quintet&#8217;s advantage had halved, too.</p>\n<p>Rather than break and bunch trundling along towards another sprint finish &#8211; as the much flatter terrain made look extremely likely &#8211;  around 80 kilometres to go the drama abruptly ratcheted up considerably thanks to a series of echelons. First on a windswept plateau, a lead group of 30 riders, including Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Ganna  &#8211; yet again  &#8211; and key rival Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) forged ahead, with GC contender Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), 2020 Tirreno-Adriatico winner Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike), and, crucially, sprinters Magnier and eventual stage winner Kooij all left trailing. </p>\n<p>The stage then splintered further as a Ganna-led break briefly went clear from the lead group, also containing Laurence De Plus, Ayuso and his UAE teammates Isaac del Toro and Felix Gro√üschartner as well as Quentin Pacher (Groupama-FDJ). But while Bahrain Victorious quickly put paid to that very dangerous move by Ganna, 30 kilometres from the line Yates&#8217; group was still the bones of a minute behind the Italian race leader&#8217;s main group.</p>\n<p>Coming through the finish for the first time of three, the five breakaway leaders &#8211; Rutsch, Arcas, Leemreize, Maestri and Blume Levy &#8211; still enjoyed a 30-second advantage on the Ganna group, only for Rutsch to crash after all that effort on a sharp, rainsoaked lefthand bend. Ineos were still hellbent on keeping Yates and co at bay, though, and all but snapped up the stage leaders on a short sharp drag of a climb. The British squad were getting scant support, though, and thanks to a concerted push by Soudal-QuickStep for Magnier, the two main groups re-fused just as the race swept through the finish for a second last time.</p>\n<p>Once again, it seemed like a bunch sprint would be a virtual certainty and once again restless GC contenders and all-rounders all but wrecked the narrative. A very active Healy and Van der Poel both made attempts to bridge across to the remnants of the early break on a sharp little climb midway through the final local loop and while Van der Poel was sucked back in, Healy eventually made his repeated attacks stick with just two kilometres to go. The Irishman&#8217;s gutsy late effort breathed a new spark of life into a break just seconds ahead of the bunch and by now only containing Maestri and Levy, only for the lead group to engulf the three riders within sight of the finishing gantry, and give Kooij the chance to snatch the hardest-fought of bunch sprint wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Olav Kooij (Visma-Lease a Bike) claimed a last-ditch bunch sprint win on a rainsoaked stage 4 of Tirreno-Adriatico, as a severely reduced peloton snapped up the remnants of a day-long break and late attacker Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) agonisingly close to the line.</p>\n<p>Second was Rick Pluimers (Tudor Pro Cycling), with Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) claiming third. Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) retained the overall lead for a fourth straight day.</p>\n<p>A series of splits in the final third of an action-packed 190-kilometre stage from Norcia to Trasacco, including one six-rider GC attack featuring race leader Ganna and key rival Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), all failed to consolidate. Then, however, a dangerous move by Healy with four kilometres to go, scorching across to the remnants of the early break, forced Ineos to chase hard behind.</p>\n<p>Once Healy and co. had been caught almost at the last moment possible, the widely expected bunch sprint finally materialised, but with such a small lead group, it was a very uncontrolled affair.</p>\n<p>Young French sprinter Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep) opened up the dash for the line from fourth in the string and Van der Poel quickly overhauled him. However, Kooij came dashing up on the right-hand side of the group to claim his third win of the season, and first-ever stage victory in Tirreno-Adriatico.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really fought for it,&#8221; Kooij, who had been caught on the wrong side of one of the bigger late splits, said afterwards. &#8220;We set the pace over the main climb and I thought I&#8217;d make it because we kept the break close, but on the plateau, we were surprised a bit by echelons.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;That set us on the back foot and sometimes I thought we&#8217;d come back, others I didn&#8217;t believe it any more. But the guys did great work and once we were there I knew I had to switch on and go for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sick in the UAE Tour, but second in Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne, Kooij said &#8220;That [illness] was a little setback, but I had a good reset in Kuurne and I was looking forward to this race.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d ridden it once before, but I really wanted to win a stage here and I&#8217;m super happy that after a hard fight today, I got it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nDespite looking like a sprinters&#8217; stage on paper, the peloton had barely swung into the collective saddle before they immediately faced a serious test, the 14-kilometre Forca della Civita &#8211; and in a foretaste of what proved to be an entertainingly volatile stage, race leader Ganna was amongst those to try to get away early.</p>\n<p>However, the first break actually to consolidate came thanks to Mark Donovan (Q36.5) and Roger Adri√° (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and the Briton and Catalan had made over the summit of the Forca, only to be reeled, an hour-long period of skirmishing then ensued.</p>\n<p>Such a fraught start all but guaranteed only a strong break would survive and when finally a five-man move containing Jonas Rutsch (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Jorge Arcas (Movistar), Gijs Leemreize (Picnic-PostNL), Mirco Maestri (Polti-VisitMalta) and William Blume Levy (Uno-X Mobility) emerged, it quickly gained an impressive gap of six minutes as stage 4 headed towards the main, mid-stage ascent of the day, the Valico la Crocetta.</p>\n<p>Rutsch, 1:52 behind Ganna on GC that morning, briefly became race leader on the road, but UAE Team Emirates kept up a strong pace behind though, causing both stage 2 winner Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) and fellow fastman Dylan Groenwegen (Jayco-AUIAa) to end up getting dropped. Not only that, after a long haul up to the summit of Valica la Crocetta, the quintet&#8217;s advantage had halved, too.</p>\n<p>Rather than break and bunch trundling along towards another sprint finish &#8211; as the much flatter terrain made look extremely likely &#8211;  around 80 kilometres to go the drama abruptly ratcheted up considerably thanks to a series of echelons. First on a windswept plateau, a lead group of 30 riders, including Tom Pidcock (Q36.5), Ganna  &#8211; yet again  &#8211; and key rival Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) forged ahead, with GC contender Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), 2020 Tirreno-Adriatico winner Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike), and, crucially, sprinters Magnier and eventual stage winner Kooij all left trailing. </p>\n<p>The stage then splintered further as a Ganna-led break briefly went clear from the lead group, also containing Laurence De Plus, Ayuso and his UAE teammates Isaac del Toro and Felix Gro√üschartner as well as Quentin Pacher (Groupama-FDJ). But while Bahrain Victorious quickly put paid to that very dangerous move by Ganna, 30 kilometres from the line Yates&#8217; group was still the bones of a minute behind the Italian race leader&#8217;s main group.</p>\n<p>Coming through the finish for the first time of three, the five breakaway leaders &#8211; Rutsch, Arcas, Leemreize, Maestri and Blume Levy &#8211; still enjoyed a 30-second advantage on the Ganna group, only for Rutsch to crash after all that effort on a sharp, rainsoaked lefthand bend. Ineos were still hellbent on keeping Yates and co at bay, though, and all but snapped up the stage leaders on a short sharp drag of a climb. The British squad were getting scant support, though, and thanks to a concerted push by Soudal-QuickStep for Magnier, the two main groups re-fused just as the race swept through the finish for a second last time.</p>\n<p>Once again, it seemed like a bunch sprint would be a virtual certainty and once again restless GC contenders and all-rounders all but wrecked the narrative. A very active Healy and Van der Poel both made attempts to bridge across to the remnants of the early break on a sharp little climb midway through the final local loop and while Van der Poel was sucked back in, Healy eventually made his repeated attacks stick with just two kilometres to go. The Irishman&#8217;s gutsy late effort breathed a new spark of life into a break just seconds ahead of the bunch and by now only containing Maestri and Levy, only for the lead group to engulf the three riders within sight of the finishing gantry, and give Kooij the chance to snatch the hardest-fought of bunch sprint wins.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the race usually starts with a prologue in the Paris region and ends with a final stage either in Nice or on the Col d&#8217;√àze overlooking the city. The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C√¥te d&#8217;Azur.[2] The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. </p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease A Bike) was denied a mountain stage victory on stage 4 of Paris-Nice as Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) sprinted from behind to pip the Dane to the win atop La Loge des Gardes.</p>\n<p>The Portuguese rider led the chase in a select lead group at the end of the 163km stage, with Vingegaard having gone up the road solo in the final 2km of the 6.7km closing climb. </p>\n<p>Vingegaard was grimly hanging on in the final 500 metres, but Almeida punched past in the steep closing inclines to come through and claim the 14th triumph of his career.</p>\n<p>The Dane and his teammate, race leader Matteo Jorgenson, had played a one-two game on the final climb, closing down attacks and controlling the race, before Vingegaard followed a Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) move at 2.5km to go before jumping clear on his own.</p>\n<p>He held a small gap ‚Äì never more than around 10 seconds ‚Äì on the road, and it was an advantage that slimmed as he neared the finish line, with Almeida leading the charge and eventually accelerating past to score the win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm super happy. It was a hard day. A lot happened in this stage, and we had some snow on the course. But we never gave up. I think we deserved it and I‚Äôm very happy for it,&#8221; Almeida said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was feeling quite good. Of course, to be honest, I‚Äôm not the best guy with the cold temperatures. I was suffering with that, but I never gave up. The climb wasn‚Äôt steep enough and it was hard to make the group smaller. Jonas attacked and I wasn‚Äôt in the best position, but I gave my best and I‚Äôm super happy again.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yesterday was not our day. We had some setbacks,‚Äù Almeida said of the stage 3 team time trial. But yesterday was yesterday, and today was another opportunity. We needed to take the positives from yesterday, like I was feeling really good and did a really good effort. We lose as a team, and we win as a team and I think we deserve it today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we can [win Paris-Nice], but it‚Äôs not just up to me, you know? I think my shape is good and I feel good and I‚Äôm ready to show who Jo√£o Almeida is. For sure, I‚Äôll give my best.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Behind Vingegaard, another Dane, Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek), rounded out the stage podium, while Jorgenson finished in sixth place at six seconds down. As a result, and taking into account Vingegaard‚Äôs six bonus seconds, the American cedes the lead to his teammate and now lies in second overall at five seconds down.</p>\n<p>Skjelmose is third overall at 33 seconds, while Almeida lies in fifth at a 37-second deficit, one place and one second down on fourth-placed Florian Lipowitz (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter two sprint stages and a team time trial, stage 4 of Paris-Nice would bring the first GC challenge of the race. The peloton would tackle a mountainous 163.4km route from Vichy to La Loge des Gardes. Six climbs and 2,700 metres of ascent filled the stage, including the closing first-category climb (6.7km at 7.1%).</p>\n<p>Attacks went from the very start of the day, which was an uphill run to the opening climb of the C√¥te de Lavoine (7.6km at 4%). It would take just under 20km for a move to get away with Andreas Leknessund (Uno-X Mobility) among the eight-rider group.</p>\n<p>The Norwegian climber would be joined in the break by Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), Thibault Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), Vincenzo Albanese (EF Education-EasyPost), Dion Smith (Intermarch√©-Wanty), Thomas Gachinard (TotalEnergies), and Edward Planckaert (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease A Bike, fresh off their TTT-winning effort on stage 3, took control at the head of the peloton, letting the break go three minutes up the road over the challenging early terrain.</p>\n<p>On the road, Gachinard set out his stall as a mountain classification challenger, beating Leknessund and Moniquet to the top of the day‚Äôs first two climbs, the C√¥te de Lavoine and C√¥te de la Bruy√®re.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman picked up six points there and added another three at the C√¥te de la Croix Bruy√®re before leading over the C√¥te du Canon, 51km from the line, to take his total to 14 points.</p>\n<p>That put him two clear of KOM leader, his TotalEnergies teammate Alexandre Delettre, while back in the peloton Bahrain Victorious‚Äô GC hope Santiago Buitrago crashed out of the race on a descent.</p>\n<p>On the way up the Canon, Ineos Grenadiers sent two men ‚Äì Josh Tarling and Tobias Foss ‚Äì on an unexpected attack two minutes behind the break. Up front, Smith was the first to drop from the group, leaving seven men in the race lead.</p>\n<p>The action wouldn‚Äôt last much longer, however, as worsening weather conditions, including heavy sleet and hail, saw race commissaires call a halt to the stage</p>\n<p>The neutralisation, called at 46km to go, saw riders stop at their team cars to change clothes, add jackets, and take on hot drinks in the freezing conditions. </p>\n<p>TV pictures showed snow falling at the finish, a crash-damaged Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale car, and ‚Äì separately ‚Äì a race motorbike crashed off-road down the grass verge.</p>\n<p>After a short break, the riders got going again, rolling over the plateau and on a descent towards the day‚Äôs intermediate sprint. At 29km to go, though, the race was stopped again to let the peloton regroup ahead of a proper restart, with the break set to be let up the road with their previous time advantage.</p>\n<p><strong>Racing Resumes</strong><br />\nRacing got underway again shortly afterwards, with conditions at the finish looking much drier, with the seven-man break lying 1:35 up on Smith, Foss, and Tarling, while the peloton lay 2:20 down.</p>\n<p>Leknessund shot off the front alone at 26km to go to lead over the intermediate sprint, while the remainder of the break ‚Äì minus Albanese ‚Äì chased behind as Movistar, Nils Politt (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) and Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) took it up at the head of the peloton.</p>\n<p>At 16km to go, Leknessund was rejoined by his breakmates while Swift dropped back to assist Foss and Tarling, who lay 30 seconds off the leaders.</p>\n<p>On the day‚Äôs penultimate climb, the third-category C√¥te de la Chabanne, Gachinard picked up another three mountain points to take his total to 17, five clear of Delettre.</p>\n<p>The chasing Ineos trio joined the break to make it an eight-man group shortly afterwards, though at that point, 10km from the finish, the peloton lay just 35 seconds back.</p>\n<p>The early inclines of the closing climb saw Tarling pilot Foss off the front, launching the Norwegian with 6km to go. The remains of the break were brought back over the next 2km, though Foss persisted, holding off Pedersen, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, and Visma-Lease A Bike with a 25-second margin.</p>\n<p>Lipowitz made the first move from the GC men at 4km to go, with  Martinez trying shortly afterward, though Visma-Lease A Bike pair Matteo Jorgenson and Jonas Vingegaard shut down both attacks.</p>\n<p>The group had Foss in sight at the 2.5km mark, and it was over for the solo leader a further 500 metres up the mountain as Martinez and Vingegaard came across. Vingegaard shook the pair off as he crossed the 2km mark, pushing on alone as a chase group of six formed.</p>\n<p>Almeida led the pacemaking with Jorgenson marking, but as the Portuguese rider got closer and closer to the solo leader, the American could do nothing to prevent his rival from accelerating across to ‚Äì and beyond ‚Äì his teammate to score his first win of the 2025 season.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>A well-timed late acceleration in a small group sprint saw Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) clinch a rain-soaked hilly stage 3 of Tirreno-Adriatico ahead of Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) and Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ).</p>\n<p>The first GC road stage of the 2025 race from Follonica to Colfiorito boiled down to some late attacks on a lengthy HC climb peaking out close to the finish, with race leader Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) coming under fire from various rivals but responding perfectly.</p>\n<p>Ganna then opted to try for a second stage win in three days with a very dangerous late attack once the race had passed the summit, but his time-trialling move was closed down by Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Very active on the final climb, Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) then made a last-ditch attempt to take the win, only for Vendrame to power past him within sight of the finishing gantry, and claim his first victory since a third-week mountain stage of the Giro d&#8217;Italia last year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This was a very hard stage, first because of the length and the weather but also because of the overall situation,&#8221; Vendrame said as he celebrated Italy&#8217;s third win in as many days in Tirreno. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really cold and rainy, my teammate Johannes [Staune-Mittet] who&#8217;s fighting for GC crashed and went down, I hope he&#8217;s ok.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then in the final I knew I had a good burst of speed and the form was good, so I could get the win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had had this stage as a possible one for me, but only in part. My director told me I could go for the sprint today and he was right.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Earlier on in the day, stage 2 winner and another potential contender for a small group sprint Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) fell heavily on a wet bend shortly before the final ascent, and lost several minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 239 kilometre stage, the longest of this year&#8217;s edition, looked bound to provide at least some minor GC shakeups given its very hilly profile as well as the distance. Key challenges including the Passo del Lume Spento, an interminable cat. 2 grind a third of the way through, as well as the final Valico de Colfiorito, rated HC because of its daunting 18.4 kilometres of climbing rather than its comparatively gentle, well-surfaced gradient of just 3%. </p>\n<p>Stage 3 had three non-starters including former Tour of Flanders winner Alberto Bettiol (XDS-Astana), but despite the grim weather it still got off to a fast start nonetheless for repeat breakaway artist Davide Bais (Polti-VisitMalta) and compatriot Lorenzo Conforti (VF-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) who took off at the gun. The rest of the bunch, wary of their fast-looming first major encounter with the climbs as well as the relentlessly soggy conditions, eased back notably and let the two Italians get on with it, opening up a gap of four minutes in no time at all.</p>\n<p>The two made it as far as the Lume Spento pass, but as the rain teemed down the lights then went out on the break shortly afterwards, and the peloton ground onwards through the miserable weather all together and without any further movement for nearly an hour. The pack then squelched its rain-soaked way over a second, much shorter classified climb, La Foce, and into the final 100 kilometres with no significant developments.</p>\n<p>66 kilometres from the finish, an attack by Dries de Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Andrea Pietrobon (Polti-VisitMalta) gained significant time and forced Ineos Grenadiers back on the chase. De Bondt, with a GC time loss of 1:06 before the stage was the most dangerous threat, but Pietrobon, at 1:28 was not far behind, either.</p>\n<p>A major crash in the back half of the bunch at 23 kilometres to go on a rain-soaked left-hand bend saw Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) fall heavily, losing his front wheel, but did not cause the main pursuit to slow. Fortunately the Italian sprinter could continue racing after several minutes, albeit well behind and losing even more time ‚Äì but determined to remain in the race, nonetheless.</p>\n<p>At the foot of the Valico and as the road gradually steepened, Ineos continued to drive hard at the head of the peloton to keep Ganna in the driving seat, with at least 60 or 70 riders following in their wake. The British team&#8217;s concerted pace reduced the duo&#8217;s lead to just over 90 seconds for the two leaders at 16kms from the finish, and it continued to fall steadily from thereon.</p>\n<p>As the race wound up the long valley road, Mathieu van der Poel ordered his Alpecin-Deceuninck troops to add their support to Ineos control. Pietrobon attempted to stay clear when De Bondt was the first to crack. Finally with nine kilometres to the finish Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) opened up the first of the GC hostilities, roaring past the Italian breakaway as Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) countered. </p>\n<p>Healy&#8217;s brief sally was followed by a much more serious acceleration by teammate Richard Carapaz, shadowed by Van der Poel and race leader Ganna, only for a promising GC move of nine or 10 riders to quickly absorbed by a much bigger pursuing pack. Laurens De Plus then began to set down a steadier pace, but his teammate Ganna&#8217;s quiet display of power, chasing down many of the moves in person then slotting himself in second behind the Belgian, was an even more impressive deterrent for his rivals. Healy made another determined effort over the summit of the Valico at four km to go, lining out the peloton, yet the gentle broad descent, the Irishman was sucked in again.</p>\n<p>Ganna himself then opted for a devastating acceleration with three kilometres to go, opening up a gap of some five seconds as the peloton hesitated. Ayuso charged along behind in hot pursuit, followed by Uno-X Mobility, and on a slight rise leading to the last kilometre Van der Poel chased the Italian down in person. There was still time for Healy, yet again, to make another sustained acceleration, but his move proved to be a little too early as the road steepened briefly but perceptibly, with Vendrame opting to bolt for the line just as the bunch crested a last sharp little rise. Pidcock was quick enough to follow him, with Gr√©goire in hot pursuit, but neither could match Vendrame&#8217;s late burst of power to a first victory of 2025 ahead of the Briton and Frenchman.</p>\n<p>Although various statements of GC intent have been made, then, ultimately Ganna is now looking set to hold his 22-second lead over Ayuso for at least another day, given stage 4&#8217;s much shorter 190 kilometre leg from Norcia to Trasacco returns the Tirreno peloton to much easier terrain, and likely a full bunch sprint. After that, though, stage 5&#8217;s hillier finale could well see more GC skirmishing before Saturday&#8217;s showdown in the Apennines.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Raced over eight days, the race usually starts with a prologue in the Paris region and ends with a final stage either in Nice or on the Col d&#8217;√àze overlooking the city. The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C√¥te d&#8217;Azur.[2] The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. </p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike powered to victory in the stage 3 team time trial in Paris-Nice, moving defending champion Matteo Jorgenson into the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p>The Dutch team beat Jayco-AlUla by 14 seconds ‚Äì runners up in this race&#8217;s TTT for the second time in a row ‚Äì whilst Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe finished third, 25 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Visma executed their ride perfectly, bringing four riders into the final 2km and setting up Jorgenson and Jonas Vingegaard to cross the line together, taking time from all their rivals.</p>\n<p>Jorgenson now leads the overall, and will wear the yellow jersey for the first time tomorrow, having only taken the lead on the final stage when he won Paris-Nice in 2024.</p>\n<p>Former race leader Tim Merlier expectedly relinquished the jersey, with his Soudal-QuickStep teammates finishing 50 seconds down, as the Belgian rolled home at an easy pace after being dropped. He will instead wear the green jersey on stage 4.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard moves into second overall, six seconds down on his teammate, whilst current third is Michael Matthews (Jayco-AlUla), 21 seconds down with his leader Ben O&#8217;Connor in fourth on the same time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just proud of the boys,&#8221; Jorgenson said at the finish. &#8220;I think we did the plan as well as we could, and I&#8217;m just happy with the commitment from everyone. I don&#8217;t take it for granted having six guys next to me all committed to a plan. It feels good to have it behind us now.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jorgenson revealed that the team had been working towards this particular stage since January team camp, training with specific riders and equipment, and that they had a clear plan starting the day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to use our two motorbikes, Per [Strand Hagenes] and Edo [Affini] to the best of our ability and have them do their turns before the steep climb at the end, and then the goal was to get four of us over the steep climb which we were able to ‚Äì I&#8217;m proud of both Bart [Lemmen] and Victor [Campenaerts] for making it over that.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then from the top of the climb to the finish it was just about getting through the corners as fast as possible and taking the last kilometre with everything we had left.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest I think the execution today was as near perfect as it could be,&#8221; was Vingegaard&#8217;s assessment. &#8220;We just did the perfect team time trial today almost. We made no mistakes and we went so fast the whole day, everyone was so strong. All my teammates were incredible today.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nSecond down the ramp, Jayco-AlUla set the first early time of 30:41, with Michael Matthews stopping the clock as he sprinted across the line ahead of Ben O&#8217;Connor, all other riders dispatched during the hard effort.</p>\n<p>The way teams were sacrificing riders became most obvious on the climb, with several riders leading into the ascent and then pulling off to come almost to a halt ‚Äì or a complete standstill in the case of Ivo Oliveira (UAE Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>UAE&#8217;s effort wasn&#8217;t enough to trouble the top times, however, despite winning the TTT in the 2024 edition.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek almost took two riders to the line, but a sketchy final corner for Mads Pedersen saw Mattias Skjelmose sprinting alone to stop the clock and conserve as much GC time as possible.</p>\n<p>It was Visma-Lease A Bike who then knocked Jayco-AlUla off the top spot, going 14 seconds faster than the Australians as co-leaders Jorgenson and Vingegaard finished off a big team effort.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe managed to take three riders to the finish, but still finished 25 seconds shy of the impressive time set by the Dutch squad.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, no other team could get any closer than Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, and as final starters Soudal-QuickStep stopped the clock 50 seconds down, victory for the Dutch squad was confirmed.</p>\n<p>Visma&#8217;s two leaders were naturally the big GC winners of the day, but strong rides from Jayco AlUla and Red Bull also saw their respective leaders Ben O&#8217;Connor and Aleksandr Vlasov limit their losses in the overall. Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Mattias Skjlemose also remains within touching distance of the race lead, despite having to finish the TTT alone.</p>\n<p>Those whose GC ambitions took a dent on Tuesday include Lenny Martinez and Santiago Buitrago for Bahrain Victorious who are now just over a minute down, along with Harold Tejada (XDS-Astana), Steff Cras (TotalEnergies) and Michael Storer (Tudor Pro Cycling)</p>\n<p>That said, there were not any huge disasters, with most team leaders finishing in their team&#8217;s first group, and most of the big names still within touching distance of the race with tougher tests and climbing to come.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan powered to victory on stage 2 of Tirreno-Adriatico, delivering the win after a perfect lead-out from his well-oiled Lidl-Trek train into the crucial last corner with 300 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Milan had the prime position on entry to the finishing straight after a physical fight for the lead in the last kilometre, with his team and last man, Simone Consonni, bringing him to the final in second wheel with the line in sight.</p>\n<p>Maikel Zijlaard (Tudor) ended up second after diving up the inside of the final corner and sprinting in Milan&#8217;s slipstream. But he and third-placed Paul Penho√´t (Groupama-FDJ) were never close to matching the Italian&#8217;s top speed once he had launched his sprint.</p>\n<p>Having taken two bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint earlier in the stage and a further 10 as bonuses for the victory, Milan moved up to second overall on GC behind his compatriot Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n<p>Milan was ninth on the identical Follonica finish at last year&#8217;s race, getting the run into the final corner completely wrong. But this time, he and his team had clearly done their homework and executed their pre-race plan to perfection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, last year was the first time, and we saw how it was,&#8221; said Milan in his flash interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t forget, and we brought the experience from last year, put it into practice today, and I have to say, the guys were guiding me and leading me in the perfect way, [just] how we thought about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can imagine there was big chaos [behind]. We were always in the perfect position, always covered, and not losing too much energy. In the end, [it went] as we planned it, and we made it. Super happy and proud of my teammates. Today was perfect, a beautiful day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the opening stage time trial kicked off racing at Tirreno-Adriatico on Monday, the Race of the Two Seas continued from another familiar start location in Camaiore, Tuscany, with a 192-kilometre sprint stage heading south to Follonica in store.</p>\n<p>Just four km into the stage, the day&#8217;s breakaway had formed, with Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) attacking away from the peloton solo during the uphill start.

Traditionally held in the early part of the season, and usually counter-programmed with the Paris-Nice/&#8217;Race to the Sun&#8217;, it is considered to be an important preparation for the Giro d&#8217;Italia. It is part of the UCI World Tour, cycling&#8217;s highest level of professional men&#8217;s races. First held in 1966, the race was held over three stages. Since 2002 it is held over seven stages.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan powered to victory on stage 2 of Tirreno-Adriatico, delivering the win after a perfect lead-out from his well-oiled Lidl-Trek train into the crucial last corner with 300 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Milan had the prime position on entry to the finishing straight after a physical fight for the lead in the last kilometre, with his team and last man, Simone Consonni, bringing him to the final in second wheel with the line in sight.</p>\n<p>Maikel Zijlaard (Tudor) ended up second after diving up the inside of the final corner and sprinting in Milan&#8217;s slipstream. But he and third-placed Paul Penho√´t (Groupama-FDJ) were never close to matching the Italian&#8217;s top speed once he had launched his sprint.</p>\n<p>Having taken two bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint earlier in the stage and a further 10 as bonuses for the victory, Milan moved up to second overall on GC behind his compatriot Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n<p>Milan was ninth on the identical Follonica finish at last year&#8217;s race, getting the run into the final corner completely wrong. But this time, he and his team had clearly done their homework and executed their pre-race plan to perfection.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, last year was the first time, and we saw how it was,&#8221; said Milan in his flash interview.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t forget, and we brought the experience from last year, put it into practice today, and I have to say, the guys were guiding me and leading me in the perfect way, [just] how we thought about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can imagine there was big chaos [behind]. We were always in the perfect position, always covered, and not losing too much energy. In the end, [it went] as we planned it, and we made it. Super happy and proud of my teammates. Today was perfect, a beautiful day.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the opening stage time trial kicked off racing at Tirreno-Adriatico on Monday, the Race of the Two Seas continued from another familiar start location in Camaiore, Tuscany, with a 192-kilometre sprint stage heading south to Follonica in store.</p>\n<p>Just four km into the stage, the day&#8217;s breakaway had formed, with Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) attacking away from the peloton solo during the uphill start. The ProTeam rider quickly earned a 5:00 advantage on the main bunch.</p>\n<p>With the two top favourites for a sprint finish, Milan and Kooij,  in their numbers, Lidl-Trek and Visma-Lease a Bike took up front positions in the peloton to begin slowly reeling back in Tarozzi over the next 100km.

The event is nicknamed The Race to the Sun, as it runs in the first half of March, typically starting in cold and wintry conditions in the French capital before reaching the spring sunshine on the C√¥te d&#8217;Azur.[2] The hilly course in the last days of the race favours stage racers who often battle for victory. </p>\n<p>Belgian fastman Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) made it two out of two at Paris-Nice on Monday as the race leader followed his victory on stage 1 with another bunch sprint win on Monday.</p>\n<p>At the end of a fast, flat run across the plains west of Paris, Merlier was perfectly placed in fourth spot behind Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) as the pack blasted up the slightly rising finishing straight in Belleville.</p>\n<p>With 100 metres to go, Merlier was already a bike length ahead of his rivals and he could even slow slightly before the line to savour his win ahead of Emili√©n Jeanni√®re (TotalEnergies) and Hugo Page (Intermarch√©-Wanty).</p>\n<p>Barring Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) snatching a two-second time bonus at the stage&#8217;s one intermediate sprint, the GC contenders mostly concentrated on saving as much energy as possible prior to Tuesday&#8217;s crunch team time trial stage.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile some sizable crashes towards the back of the bunch saw several riders abandon, including Australian national champion Luke Durbridge (Jayco-AIUIa).</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is one I&#8217;m going to remember,  because I think it&#8217;s the first time in my career I have won wearing a leader&#8217;s jersey,&#8221; Merlier pointed out afterwards, &#8220;Either that or I don&#8217;t remember it any more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First of all our team were the only ones controlling the race, but then Trek started helping.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a bit annoying because the break was playing with us, coming back and then getting  more time again.

Jonas Abrahamsen (Uno-X Mobility), Alexandre Delettre (TotalEnergies) and Samuel Fernandez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), all three of them from wildcard invitation teams so presumably keen to justify their selection, with Delettre and Fern√°ndez already on the attack on stage 1 &#8212;  opened an advantage of around three minutes in the face of minimal opposition from the bunch. </p>\n<p>Already in the mountains ranking lead after the opening day, Delettre boosted his grip on the top spot by leading over the two category 3 climbs early on the stage. But barring some time in the television camera lens, there was set to be scant mid-to-long term reward for the two others in the break.</p>\n<p>Rises in speed on a series of sharp right-angled bends in the final hour saw teams battling for position on the exposed, flat plains amidst concerns about possible (but actually close to non-existent) crosswinds, and saw the peloton all but reel in the break with 53 kilometres to go. Whilst his two companions cracked, Abrahamsen pushed on again solo to rebuild a 40-second advantage, while behind the bunch, one crash victim Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ) finally returned to the pack after a long chase.</p>\n<p>Another pileup at 47 kilometres to go, on a seemingly untechnical section of straight road, left half a dozen riders on the deck, including Merlier, who had to change a wheel after someone rode into his bike, and sprint rival Arnaud D√©mare (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels). While the two sprinters could continue, D√©mare&#8217;s teammate Florian S√©n√©chal was forced to abandon on a stretcher.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Abrahamsen soldiered on, staying ahead for the intermediate sprint when the race powered through the finish for the first time with 21 kilometres to go. </p>\n<p>While last year&#8217;s overall winner Matteo Jorgenson (Visma-Lease a Bike) picked up a 2-second time bonus for third place, a crash at the back of the bunch left Gorka Sorrarain (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Australian national champion Luke Durbridge (Jayco-AIUIa) off their bikes and leaning against the finish line barriers in pain. Both riders later abandoned.</p>\n<p>The peloton splintered into a large lead group and several knots of chasers as a result of the finish line fall, rendering the chase of Abrahamsen much more difficult. Ben O&#8217;Connor (Jayco-AIUIa) was one top rider caught behind, but a slight easing in pace subsequently allowed for a general regrouping. </p>\n<p>Ark√©a and Soudal then upped their game on a technical, narrower section of country roads, even as Abrahamsen&#8217;s lead crept up to 35 seconds again. Unsurprisingly, the Norwegian did get awarded the Most Combative Rider prize, but on the long broad straightaway that followed right the way to the finish it became harder and harder for him to keep ahead.</p>\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike followed Soudal-QuickStep at the head of the peloton as they bore down on Abrahamsen, finally sucking him in with 2.5 kilometres to go. A bunch sprint was now all but certain, particularly as Uno-X and Tudor had added their weight to the front.</p>\n<p>Tucked in on the right hand side of the pack, Merlier was perfectly placed to srke as they swung into the final kilometre at just over 60 kph. Axel Zingle (Visma-Lease a Bike) hit the front with 300 metres to go, but Merlier was able to stay out of the wind and out of trouble until very late, prior to blasting ahead of his rivals with a devastating late acceleration to claim his sixth win of the season and second in 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=2&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Others, including Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike), Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek), Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), and Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) lay outside the 13:10 mark.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nTirreno-Adriatico 2025 opened with an 11.5km time trial in Lido di Camaiore, following an out-and-back route up the Tyrrhenian coast. The pan-flat course headed north for 4.5km before an intermediate time check at the hairpin before the 7km run back south to the finish.</p>\n<p>Former U23 world time trial champion Johan Price-Pejtersen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was the strongest of the early runners. Heading out as the 19th rider, he was comfortably quickest at the checkpoint and the finish, with his time of 12:45 the first of the day under 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>K√©vin Vauquelin (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) and S√∏ren W√¶renskjold (Uno-X Mobility) would come the closest to the Dane among the remainder of the first 50 riders. The Frenchman‚Äôs time of 12:58 and the Norwegian‚Äôs time of 12:54 saw them round out the provisional podium.</p>\n<p>Sprinter Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) would come the closest to overhauling Price-Pejtersen. The Italian had a speedy start to his run to edge out the leader by fractions of a second at the checkpoint. However, he faded on the run to the finish, ending up with a time of 12:48 to just miss out on the top spot.</p>\n<p>Along the way, several riders hoping to make their mark on the general classification set their times. Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) recorded a time of 13:13, Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) set a time of 13:26, Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) came home with a 13:11, while Simon Yates (Visma-Lease A Bike) finished with a 13:12.</p>\n<p>All would be beaten by Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), however. The Italian would join his former teammate Price-Pejtersen at the top of the standings as he crossed the line just one second shy of the Dane with a time of 12:46.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG youngster Isaac Del Toro would be another to record a top time at the finish. The Mexican went fifth at the line with a time of 12:55.</p>\n<p>British duo Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) and Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) would follow along shortly afterwards, with the pair recording times of 13:24 and 13:20.</p>\n<p>Other GC contenders came and went, setting decent times without troubling the top spots, but at that late stage all eyes were on the third-last starter, the double time trial world champion and double Lido di Camaiore time trial winner Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) finished with a 13:32, Ion Izagirre (Bahrain Victorious) with a 13:14, Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) with a 13:19, Romain Gregoire (Groupama-FDJ) with a 13:09, and Jai Hindley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) with a 13:13.</p>\n<p>It would take another among UAE Team Emirates-XRG‚Äôs suite of GC riders to challenge Price-Pejtersen at the top of the leaderboards, with Juan Ayuso putting up a time of 15:14 ‚Äì nine seconds up on the Dane ‚Äì at the checkpoint.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard, who won the same stage last March, kept up the pace on the closing leg of the time trial, eventually crossing the line six seconds up on Price-Pejtersen at 12:40 to take the hot seat with an average speed of 54.426kph.</p>\n<p>Ganna, second by a solitary second to Ayuso last year, was already out on the course at that point, though several other major names lay between the pair. Mattia Cattaneo (Soudal-QuickStep) went fifth with a time of 12:53 followed up by Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) with a time of 12:51.</p>\n<p>Ganna, meanwhile, came to the checkpoint trailing Ayuso‚Äôs best time by two seconds, meaning the fight for the stage victory would go all the way to the line. It turned out to be a dominant win, with the Italian blitzing the rest of the course to finish with a time of 12:17.</p>\n<p>All that was left was for the final man on the startlist to complete his race. Nairo Quintana (Movistar) closed out proceedings with a time of 14 minutes dead to put the Colombian in 133rd overall.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=3&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ) took third on GC thanks to the time she gained by winning stage 1b.</p>\n<p>The stage was due to be one for the climbers, with two category 1 climbs along the route, however, awful wet weather in the Extremadura region in Western Spain meant the stage was shortened to just 69km with both of the climbs removed.</p>\n<p>This allowed the likes of Van Dijk to contest the overall, and with any would-be attackers kept in control by her teammates, she was able to take the first GC win since returning from giving birth to her first child in 2023.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the easiest to control because there were lots of girls who could still win the race and I didn&#8217;t have a big advantage so we had to be super sharp. The girls were going full gas and were so impressive,&#8221; said Van Dijk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the intermediate sprint, we lost two seconds so it made it even tighter. On the last climb, the girls did a full lead-out for me and I knew I had to finish it off.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy I could win this GC, especially to pay back all the hard work done by the girls. It was a great week here with a great atmosphere among the team. My focus was to win the time trial on stage 1a so to win the overall is such a nice bonus.

Created in 2023, it was immediately included in the UCI Women&#8217;s International Calendar in the 2.2 class.</p>\n<p>The breakaway surprised the big teams in stage 1b of the Vuelta a Extremadura as Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ) sprinted to the win in M√©rida, just ahead of break companion Sigrid Haugset (Coop-Repsol).</p>\n<p>Marturano and Haugset had been away for just over 40km after attacking over the day‚Äôs sole categorised climb, and quickly built a gap of two minutes, holding on by just a few seconds to contest the win.</p>\n<p>The peloton had closed down most of the gap in the final 10km, but couldn‚Äôt quite make the catch and were left to sprint for third, with Clara Copponi (Lidl-Trek) and Carys Lloyd (Movistar) crossing the line together, both avoiding a crash in the final straight.  Copponi was briefly awarded third place but after review of the photo finish, Lloyd was ultimately named as third place finisher.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek had been working to protect the interests of race leader Ellen van Dijk, who won the stage 1a time trial, and though they didn‚Äôt close the gap, Marturano started the stage 50 seconds down on GC and Van Dijk finished in the bunch meaning she will hold on to the yellow leader‚Äôs jersey going into stage 2 on Friday.  </p>\n<p>This is 26-year-old Marturano‚Äôs first win as a professional, after moving to UAE Team ADQ from Fenix-Deceuninck over the winter. </p>\n<p>With two stages remaining, Van Dijk leads Mie Bj√∏rndal (Uno-X Mobility) by 10 seconds while Marturano moved up to third, 19 seconds down.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe were chasing, but we got a little bit different messages on the time gap, so we actually thought we were closer, but in the end we heard all of a sudden that we were not so close, so we had to go full gas,‚Äù Van Dijk said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe came too late in the end. Other teams were helping so that was good, but the chase was not fast enough because we thought we were closer, but the riders in the breakaway also had a really strong ride, so chapeau to them.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Coming after the morning‚Äôs 9km time trial, stage 1b comprised a 90km point-to-point route with just one categorised climb but plenty of rolling roads in Extremadura to make things difficult.</p>\n<p>The stage started with a very compact peloton and it took a long time for any attacks to start forming, and those that did try were closed down very quickly by Lidl-Trek and Uno-X Mobility, looking to protect the GC positions of Van Dijk, Mie Bj√∏rndal and Katrine Aalerud.</p>\n<p>Over the top of the category 3 climb with around 40km to go, Greta Marturano and Sigrid Haugset attacked and became the day‚Äôs breakaway, building up a gap of over two minutes, leaving the peloton quite a lot of work to do before the finale.</p>\n<p>Lidl-Trek and Visma-Lease a Bike were leading the chase, but with 10km to go the gap was still 1:18 with Marturano and Haugset working well together. In the final 5km their advantage started falling more rapidly, and it hung in the balance whether the catch would be made, but ultimately the peloton gave the strong escapees too much leeway, and the pair were able to race for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19315&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=19315&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Davide Piganzoli (Polti-VisitMalta) was second on the stage and Maxime Decomble (Groupama-FDJ) was third.</p>\n<p>Gee now leads Cort by five seconds in the general classification, with Piganzoli third overall at 17 seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy,&#8221; Gee said. &#8220;I put a lot of expectations on myself going into this &#8211; we did some work on the TT bike over the winter, and then I wanted to start the year strong in the TT. So I&#8217;m happy to win it. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a hard one. This TT actually holds a special place in my heart, because in 2022 my result in the O Gran Camino TT is what helped me get my first pro contract. It was another really hard TT at this race, but I was happy to be out there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked whether he thinks he can hold the yellow jersey until the end on Sunday, Gee said he expected the coming stages to be &#8220;chaos&#8221;.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uno-X showed yesterday how strong they are. Magnus put in a great TT today again. And then there&#8217;s a couple guys here who are really, really good climbers. It&#8217;ll be interesting. Hopefully we can, we can keepsome control.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Stage 3 of O Gran Cami√±o was a challenging 15.6km individual time trial from Ourense to Pereiro de Aguiar with a 5km climb in the first half of the route. Israel-Premier Tech&#8217;s Pau Mart√≠ and Simon Clarke set two of the fastest early times, but were surpassed by Rafael Reis (Anicolor-Tien21) with a time of 24:20</p>\n<p>Soudal-Quickstep&#8217;s development team rider Federico Savino put in a strong effort to move into the hot seat. However, Hugo Houle put Israel-Premier Tech back on top, going 14 seconds quicker than Savino at 24:02.</p>\n<p>Then, Urko Berrade (Kern Pharma) made up for some of the time he lost on stage 1 with a late puncture, going nine seconds faster than Houle to move into the hot seat. His time there did not last long, as Txomin Juaristi (Euskaltel-Euskadi), who crashed in the bunch sprint on the first stage, powered through with a time two seconds faster.</p>\n<p>But Berrade didn&#8217;t even have time to head to the podium as Maxime Decomble (Groupama-FDJ) was right behind, setting a time 12 seconds quicker ‚Äì 23:39. Piganzoli then came through with a four-second advantage to take the lead as Magnus Cort began his effort.</p>\n<p>As the bigger names rolled down the ramp onto the course, it became clear that Piganzoli&#8217;s time would not hold. Gee rolled through the intermediate check with the fastest time and was still the fastest at the finish, 17 seconds better than the Italian.</p>\n<p>Cort struggled on the climb, at one point appearing to have a problem, but he did not stop for a spare bike. He was bleeding time all along the course and lost more than enough time to put Gee into the yellow jersey.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

They opened a three-minute lead on the rolling roads but the peloton and especially Uno-X Mobility led the chase all day, determined to control the race.</p>\n<p>The trio were only caught with 20km to go but Uno-X Mobility&#8217;s work was far from done. The Alto de San Vicenzo climb offered a chance for the overall contenders to attack with 14km to go and Gee made a huge effort on the hardest part of the 2.5km climb.</p>\n<p>Gee&#8217;s repeated surges split the peloton and hurt everyone. He eventually got away with Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal QuickStep), R√©my Rochas (Groupama-FDJ), Jefferson Alveiro Cepeda (Movistar), Davide Piganzoli (Polti VisitMalta) and Cort&#8217;s teammate Andreas Kron.</p>\n<p>They opened a ten-second gap but Uno-X Mobility were chasing behind, with Kron sitting on as a deterrent. The catch came with six kilometres to go but the rolling roads continued and 19-year-old Maxime Decomble (Groupama-FDJ) tried a solo move. He got away and got a gap but Uno-X Mobility kept him in sight and he was swept up with a kilometre to go. A reduced sprint was assured.</p>\n<p>The road rose into the centre of A Estrada and Cort made sure he was on the front with leadout man Kron before the decisive right turn.</p>\n<p>Iv√°n Cobo (Equipo Kern Pharma) hit out first, as Cort looked back and was distracted for a second. However, when he opened up his sprint, the Dane surged away and won by several bike lengths.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

This finish was maybe even better than yesterday&#8217;s stage because only half the bunch survived.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cort promised he would try to defend the yellow jersey in the time trial.</p>\n<p>His biggest threat could be Canada&#8217;s Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech), who went on the attack on the climb and is only 20 seconds down on Cort in the overall classification.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 is a 15.6km time trial from Ourense to Pereiro de Aguiar.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing the opening stage in northern Portugal, the 133.2km stage 2 from Mar√≠n to A Estrada took the race into Spain&#8217;s spectacular and hilly Galicia region packed with gorges, rivers and country roads.</p>\n<p>The early break of the day included R√©mi Daumas (Groupama-FDJ), Ander Okamika (Burgos Burpullet BH) and Alvara Sagrado (Illes Balears Arabay). They opened a three-minute lead on the rolling roads but the peloton and especially Uno-X Mobility led the chase all day, determined to control the race.</p>\n<p>The trio were only caught with 20km to go but Uno-X Mobility&#8217;s work was far from done. The Alto de San Vicenzo climb offered a chance for the overall contenders to attack with 14km to go and Gee made a huge effort on the hardest part of the 2.5km climb.</p>\n<p>Gee&#8217;s repeated surges split the peloton and hurt everyone. He eventually got away with Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal QuickStep), R√©my Rochas (Groupama-FDJ), Jefferson Alveiro Cepeda (Movistar), Davide Piganzoli (Polti VisitMalta) and Cort&#8217;s teammate Andreas Kron.</p>\n<p>They opened a ten-second gap but Uno-X Mobility were chasing behind, with Kron sitting on as a deterrent. The catch came with six kilometres to go but the rolling roads continued and 19-year-old Maxime Decomble (Groupama-FDJ) tried a solo move. He got away and got a gap but Uno-X Mobility kept him in sight and he was swept up with a kilometre to go. A reduced sprint was assured.</p>\n<p>The road rose into the centre of A Estrada and Cort made sure he was on the front with leadout man Kron before the decisive right turn.</p>\n<p>Iv√°n Cobo (Equipo Kern Pharma) hit out first, as Cort looked back and was distracted for a second. However, when he opened up his sprint, the Dane surged away and won by several bike lengths.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=16526&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. Due to its early February position in the European calendar, it is used by many riders to prepare for the Spring Classics.</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) secured the overall title at the Volta ao Algarve after storming to victory on the finale 19.6km time trial that finished atop Alto do Malh√£o.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard covered the time trial with the fastest time of 28:25 with an average speed of 41.4kph beating his teammate and runner-up Wout van Aert by 11 seconds while Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) finished 14 seconds back and in third place on the day.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard started the day in sixth place in the overall standings, 20 seconds behind the overnight leader Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), but his dominant performance in the time trial saw him leap into the overall victory in his first race of the 2025 season.</p>\n<p>The two-time Tour de France winner won the overall title by 14 seconds ahead of runner-up Jo√£o Almeida (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), who finished sixth on the stage, and 23 seconds ahead of third-placed Laurens De Plus (Ineos Grenadiers), who finished eighth in on the day. While Almeida and De Plus were able to hold their podium places in the overall standings, Christen slipped to 10th overall.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Vingegaard&#8217;s former teammate Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) finished in 12th place in the time trial, 50 seconds down on the Dane. He ends his race in eighth overall at 53 seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m, of course, very happy. It was a very good day for me, for the team,&#8221; Vingegaard said after his win. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m very happy to take the overall victory and take the revenge from the other days. So, of course, I&#8217;m super happy and proud. My daughter said earlier today that I had to win today, so that gave me extra motivation to win for her.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a very nice TT. I really enjoyed it today. I always like TTs like this and, of course, it also suits me well and it depends on if you have good legs or not. If you don&#8217;t have great legs then it&#8217;s not a nice TT, and can feel like the opposite. Today I had great legs and I&#8217;m happy to finish it off,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling good and happy to do very well today. I think I did a very good time trial. I&#8217;m happy, proud and looking forward to the next part of the season.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe first rider, Pedro Andrade (Feirense-Beeceler) rolled down the start ramp at 1331 local time to tackle a course which had a far more undulating first 16 kilometres than the route book profile suggested before the definitive ascent. Amongst the top-level non-starters was Arnaud De Lie (Lotto), suffering from allergies and opted to miss the final day. </p>\n<p>Carlos Miguel Salgueiro (APHotels &#038; Resorts &#8211; Tavira-SC Farense) pulled clear of all the early finishers with a time of 32:20, nearly 30 seconds faster than his closest pursuer. But former Portuguese National Time Trial Champion Rafael Reis (Anicolor-Tien21) was the first to go under 31 minutes, clocking a time of 30:44.</p>\n<p>Reis himself was beaten by the reigning Portuguese TT champion, Ivo Oliveira (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), the first of the WorldTour racers to set a top time when he crossed the finish line at Malh√£o in 30:33, only to be quickly ousted from the hot seat by Scotland&#8217;s Callum Thornley (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe).</p>\n<p>The Edinburgh racer was provisional fourth at the intermediate time check but &#8211; as could be expected from a former mountains classification winner in the Tour of Britain ‚Äì made the most of his climbing abilities to deliver a searing ascent of the Malhao, going a full ten seconds faster. </p>\n<p>The top specialist were coming to the fore now, and after Calum Shaw (EF Education-EasyPost) smashed his compatriot&#8217;s mark and became the first rider under 30 minutes with a time of 29:36, he was rapidly overhauled by Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Swedish National TT Champion Jakob S√∂derqvist, who clocked 29:04.</p>\n<p>His Italian counterpart Filippo Ganna was unable to close the gap by more than 12 seconds, suffering badly on the final ascent. But Wout Van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike) was much more at home on both, sharply contrasting, segments of the course, going five seconds faster than S√∂derqvist at the second checkpoint and more than doubling that to a stunning finishing time of 28:36.</p>\n<p>After missing out on two bunch sprints, could he take his first time trial victory since the 2023 National Championships? The air at the sunlit finish line on Malhao was buzzing with the idea, particularly as top specialists like Stefan K√ºng and Remi Cavagna (both Groupama-FDJ) could not come close. Antonio Tiberi (Lidl-Trek) was just three seconds behind, but for more than an hour, the Italian was the Belgian&#8217;s most dangerous challenger.</p>\n<p>One big challenger for Van Aert was undoubtedly Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), riding his one time trial before the Giro d&#8217;Italia and keen to make use of Algarve, as his team previously told Cyclingnews, as a serious test. However, Rogliƒç was already more than 30 seconds off the pace at the first checkpoint behind the fastest time of Filippo Ganna,  and he finally completed the course 38 seconds down on Van Aert.</p>\n<p>Vingegaard was another story. Fifth fastest at checkpoint 1, six seconds down on Ganna, and cutting through each corner faultlessly, Vingegaard looked utterly focused as he blasted along the course and moved into fourth quickest by the second.</p>\n<p>Opting, unlike Van Aert not to change to a TT bike for the climb, it barely mattered, from beginning to end, Vingegaard looked to be totally in his element as he powered towards the third time trial victory of his career.</p>\n<p>At the finish, the timings confirmed Vingegaard&#8217;s excellent result, eleven seconds faster than Van Aert.  What remained, of course, was how the UAE&#8217;s three riders ahead of Vingegaard on GC could defend their position.</p>\n<p>A week after winning the Figuieras Champions Classic, Antonio Morgado crossed the line 1:05 down, but as a one-day specialist that was perhaps not so surprising. More unexpectedly,  Joao Almeida, however, was also well off the pace, crossing the line 30 seconds down, while Jan Christen, already 33 seconds down on Vingegaard at the second checkpoint, was already out of the picture.</p>\n<p>As a result, Vingegaard claimed his first two victories of the season, providing both a strong answer to the question marks that emerged after his defeat on the Alto da Foia, and also sending an impressive warning shot across the bows of Tadej Pogaƒçar after his UAE triumph. The Slovenian star is clearly in impressive form in 2024, but Vingegaard is prepared to give him a run for his money, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Until 2008 it was run as a one-day race, part of the UCI Europe Tour. In 2009, the race transformed to a 2.1 event, raced over two days.</p>\n<p>Dorian Godon (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) won the second and final stage of the Tour des Alpes-Maritimes et du Var, beating Joseph Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech) to the line in Vence as the pair led home an elite group of 24 contenders.</p>\n<p>Stage 1 winner Cristian Scaroni (XDS-Astana) was among the leading group, finishing in 19th place and thus securing the overall victory for himself ‚Äì his third win in three days and a first stage race victory on his palmar√®s.</p>\n<p>The Italian beats Bahrain Victorious duo Santiago Buitrago and Lenny Martinez to the top spot, just two days after also winning the Tour du Var. Buitrago lost out by six seconds in total, while Martinez‚Äôs third place came at 12 seconds back.</p>\n<p>The first stage of the two-part race was always set to be the most decisive of the weekend, with Scaroni outfoxing the Bahrain duo at the end of the mountainous stage to Gourdon. However, there was still plenty left to fight for on the final stage.</p>\n<p>Four climbs, including the first-category ascents of the Col d&#8217;Eze and Col de Ch√¢teauneuf, and a pair of later, lesser hills ‚Äì Carros and then the Mont√©e de la Sine near the finish ‚Äì would still pose challenges to the hopefuls for stage and overall glory.</p>\n<p>In the opening kilometres of the stage heading to the Eze, a strong group of 14 riders including Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Kevin Geniets (Groupama-FDJ), and Louis Meintjes (Intermarch√©-Wanty) went clear, but the move wasn&#8217;t allowed much leeway before being brought back into the fold.</p>\n<p>Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) was next to give it a go, attacking on the Col de Ch√¢teauneuf around 90km from the finish. His move wouldn&#8217;t be the race decider, though it would draw out several other big names to form a large group of favourites.</p>\n<p>Soon afterwards, a break of two ‚Äì Harry Sweeny (EF Education-EasyPost) and Louis Barr√© (Intermarch√©-Wanty) were allowed two minutes up the road. They would be brought back before the finish, though, leaving it up to the favourites to once again duke it out over the win.</p>\n<p>Buitrago was the main aggressor, attempting to dislodge Scaroni and take over the race lead for good. The Italian stuck to the Bahrain rider&#8217;s wheel, though, ensuring that there wouldn&#8217;t be a change in jersey ownership at the finish.</p>\n<p>Among all the GC battling, it was Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale who profited. The French squad organised themselves to lead out Godon for the final, setting him up to sprint for the line. In the end, the likes of Buitrago and Scaroni were out of the picture for stage honours, with Godon&#8217;s acceleration more than enough to blast through and grab his 11th career triumph.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

His move seemed to open the floodgates though, and several attempts to split the group followed, with the gap to the bunch stretching back out to around 1:40 with around 25 kilometres to go to the finish.</p>\n<p>As they passed through the 20 kilometres to go point, Uno-X Mobility once again drove the pace at the front of the race, pulling a group of five riders clear but once again counter-attacks from the remainder of the group prevented them from going clear, though the increased pace began to take its toll on a few of the riders who began to lose touch at the back of the group.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a five-rider group detached itself, with Giovanni Carboni of Unibet Tietema Rockets able to bridge across to make it six. The group worked together well to carve out a lead over the chasers, which grew rapidly as the riders in pursuit continued to attack one another.</p>\n<p>With the rock of Gibraltar coming into view, the group were eyeing victory against a dramatic backdrop, but two of them would be ruled out of contention as Iker Mintegi (Euskaltel-Euskadi) lost grip on a corner taking Thomas Gachignard (Team TotalEnergies) down with him.

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020.

About twenty kilometres from the finish, I felt that I was capable of aiming for victory. I concentrated well and gave it my all until the finish. It‚Äôs really nice.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Yellow jersey Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) finished safely in the bunch and held his overall race lead. Ahead of Sunday&#8217;s concluding time trial, he lies four seconds ahead of his teammate Jo√£o Almeida and seven seconds ahead of Laurens De Plus (Ineos Grenadiers).</p>\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) fell victim to a late scare just as the race hit 3km to go. The Dane suffered a mechanical and drifted off the back of the field, receiving a quick bike change before cruising to the finish line at the same time as the rest of the field. He holds his fifth place overall at 20 seconds back heading into stage 5.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 4 began with a few showers but warm temperatures in the town of Albufeira, the scene of the key time trial in last year&#8217;s Volta ao Algarve.</p>\n<p>This time around, rather than leaving one by one, 163 riders began the 175km stage, with Arnaud de Lie&#8217;s lead-out man Jarrad Drizners (Lotto) and Portuguese Olympic track star Iur√≠ Leit√£o (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), who crashed late on stage 3, amongst the non-starters.</p>\n<p>Very early on, four riders formed the breakaway of the day, Belgian Warre Vangheluwe (Soudal-QuickStep), Johan Jacobs (Groupama-FDJ), Leit√£o&#8217;s teammate Gorka Sorrain, and the mountains classification leader, German Nicolas Tivani (Aviludo-Louletano-Loul√©).</p>\n<p>Tivani added a useful stack of points when the four went over the second-category Alto do Malh√£o after 40km, the climb set to be revisited by the peloton as the summit of Sunday&#8217;s final time trial.</p>\n<p>But for the quartet, the bigger question was whether their large margin of nearly eight minutes would be enough stay away over the series of climbs in the finale and perhaps fight for victory in Algarve&#8217;s third and last road stage of 2025.</p>\n<p>If the presence of two WorldTour riders in the breakaway of the day was already a novelty in this year&#8217;s Algarve ‚Äì so far they&#8217;ve been exclusively made up of ProTeam and Continental racers ‚Äì the next unexpected ingredient emerged when a Bahrain Victorious duo, Vlad Van Mechelen and Afonso Eulalio, counter-attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>After 120km, by the foot of the third-category Picota, the two had been swept up again and the four-man breakaway tackled the first of the three late climbs on the stage still three minutes ahead.</p>\n<p>Impressively, despite the noted rise in pace by EF Education-EasyPost, Visma-Lease A Bike and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe behind, it had little impact, with the four maintaining almost all of their advantage by the intermediate sprint at Loul√©, 40km from the finish.</p>\n<p>The addition of Intermarch√©-Wanty and Tudor to the chase on the approach to the final two climbs of the day, the third-category Santa Barbara and fourth-category Bordeira proved more effective in cutting the gap, though.</p>\n<p>Tivani, conscious his main goal was to rack up as many mountain points as possible, put in much of the spadework on the approach and the four continued to work well on the ascent as Visma-Lease A Bike shredded the pack behind.</p>\n<p>Just 30 seconds separated the stage leaders from the Visma-led peloton by the summit of the Santa Barbara and if the road had followed with a clear descent, it might yet have allowed them to stay away.</p>\n<p>Instead, the false flats and fourth-category ascent of Bordeira proved a tricky combination to handle, even if the peloton briefly eased back a little to ensure they reeled the break in as late as possible.</p>\n<p>But when the road steepened notably on the Bordeira, Visma turned up the throttle again and with 18km to go, the break was over and a 60-strong lead peloton began a breakneck descent back to the coast and the finish.</p>\n<p>Tivani was crowned the most combative rider of the day for his trouble as the break was brought back 17km from the finish. Thereafter, a reduced peloton reset with Visma-Lease a Bike, Lidl-Trek, Intermarch√©-Wanty, EF Education-EasyPost and Picnic-PostNL lined out at the front of the race on the false flat and fast run-in to Faro.</p>\n<p>Tiesj Benoot delivered his Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Wout van Aert to the front with 3km to go, as the peloton jostled for position while exiting a highway ramp and then onto the small city roads to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Up front, the sprint squads were lining up their lead-out trains ready for the finish, and, at the end of the rapid run-in, it was Fretin who was left to celebrate.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He holds his fifth place overall at 20 seconds back heading into stage 5.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 4 began with a few showers but warm temperatures in the town of Albufeira, the scene of the key time trial in last year&#8217;s Volta ao Algarve.</p>\n<p>This time around, rather than leaving one by one, 163 riders began the 175km stage, with Arnaud de Lie&#8217;s lead-out man Jarrad Drizners (Lotto) and Portuguese Olympic track star Iur√≠ Leit√£o (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), who crashed late on stage 3, amongst the non-starters.</p>\n<p>Very early on, four riders formed the breakaway of the day, Belgian Warre Vangheluwe (Soudal-QuickStep), Johan Jacobs (Groupama-FDJ), Leit√£o&#8217;s teammate Gorka Sorrain, and the mountains classification leader, German Nicolas Tivani (Aviludo-Louletano-Loul√©).</p>\n<p>Tivani added a useful stack of points when the four went over the second-category Alto do Malh√£o after 40km, the climb set to be revisited by the peloton as the summit of Sunday&#8217;s final time trial.</p>\n<p>But for the quartet, the bigger question was whether their large margin of nearly eight minutes would be enough stay away over the series of climbs in the finale and perhaps fight for victory in Algarve&#8217;s third and last road stage of 2025.</p>\n<p>If the presence of two WorldTour riders in the breakaway of the day was already a novelty in this year&#8217;s Algarve ‚Äì so far they&#8217;ve been exclusively made up of ProTeam and Continental racers ‚Äì the next unexpected ingredient emerged when a Bahrain Victorious duo, Vlad Van Mechelen and Afonso Eulalio, counter-attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>After 120km, by the foot of the third-category Picota, the two had been swept up again and the four-man breakaway tackled the first of the three late climbs on the stage still three minutes ahead.</p>\n<p>Impressively, despite the noted rise in pace by EF Education-EasyPost, Visma-Lease A Bike and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe behind, it had little impact, with the four maintaining almost all of their advantage by the intermediate sprint at Loul√©, 40km from the finish.</p>\n<p>The addition of Intermarch√©-Wanty and Tudor to the chase on the approach to the final two climbs of the day, the third-category Santa Barbara and fourth-category Bordeira proved more effective in cutting the gap, though.</p>\n<p>Tivani, conscious his main goal was to rack up as many mountain points as possible, put in much of the spadework on the approach and the four continued to work well on the ascent as Visma-Lease A Bike shredded the pack behind.</p>\n<p>Just 30 seconds separated the stage leaders from the Visma-led peloton by the summit of the Santa Barbara and if the road had followed with a clear descent, it might yet have allowed them to stay away.</p>\n<p>Instead, the false flats and fourth-category ascent of Bordeira proved a tricky combination to handle, even if the peloton briefly eased back a little to ensure they reeled the break in as late as possible.</p>\n<p>But when the road steepened notably on the Bordeira, Visma turned up the throttle again and with 18km to go, the break was over and a 60-strong lead peloton began a breakneck descent back to the coast and the finish.</p>\n<p>Tivani was crowned the most combative rider of the day for his trouble as the break was brought back 17km from the finish. Thereafter, a reduced peloton reset with Visma-Lease a Bike, Lidl-Trek, Intermarch√©-Wanty, EF Education-EasyPost and Picnic-PostNL lined out at the front of the race on the false flat and fast run-in to Faro.</p>\n<p>Tiesj Benoot delivered his Visma-Lease a Bike teammate Wout van Aert to the front with 3km to go, as the peloton jostled for position while exiting a highway ramp and then onto the small city roads to the finish line.</p>\n<p>Up front, the sprint squads were lining up their lead-out trains ready for the finish, and, at the end of the rapid run-in, it was Fretin who was left to celebrate.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Until 2008 it was run as a one-day race, part of the UCI Europe Tour. In 2009, the race transformed to a 2.1 event, raced over two days.</p>\n<p>Cristian Scaroni (XDS-Astana) racked up his second win in two days to claim victory on the opening day of the Tour des Alpes-Maritimes, the Italian triumphing from a lead group against two Bahrain Victorious riders on the summit finish of Gourdon.</p>\n<p>He beat Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) after jumping from the wheel of another Bahrain man, Lenny Martinez, 100 metres from the finish on the steep finishing slopes at the end of the 162km day.</p>\n<p>Scaroni‚Äôs win continues his highly successful start to the 2025 season, which has seen him take podium finishes at the Cl√†ssica Comunitat Valenciana, the Trofeo Calvi√†, and the Vuelta a Murcia, as well as score victory at Friday‚Äôs Classic Var.</p>\n<p>Scaroni, Buitrago, and Martinez had led the way for the final 5.5km of the finishing climb on a day which brought 3,500 metres of climbing, with the Frenchman pushing the pace on the front to distance a strong chasing group.</p>\n<p>Bahrain looked to set up the closing sprint for Buitrago, but Scaroni ‚Äì clearly in some of the best form of his career ‚Äì had too much for the Colombian and shot to the win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúYesterday was really hard and today was harder because everybody waited for us,‚Äù Scaroni said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúEF tried to make a really hard race from the start. Battistella, my teammate, said that he was suffering on the long climb with the hard pace.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm in good shape on the last climb. Bahrain tried to attack a lot of times but in the end, I won the sprint with Buitrago.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúTomorrow we‚Äôll try to keep the jersey. I‚Äôm really happy for the team and we‚Äôll see tomorrow. It will be another day.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Scaroni now holds the overall race lead heading into a gentler concluding stage to Vence on Sunday. He enjoys a four-second lead on Buitrago while Martinez lies in third at 10 seconds. Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana) and Jarno Widar (Lotto) are in fourth and fifth places at 57 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe opening stage of the two-part Tour des Alpes-Maritimes et du Var would see the riders tackle a mountainous 162km course between Contes and Gourdon. The first-category climbs of the Col Saint-Roch and Col de Ch√¢teauneuf, as well as two ascents of the second-category Gourdon, lay along the route.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from the start of the stage, but it wasn‚Äôt until the riders hit the Col Saint-Roch that a breakaway got away. On the way up the 11km climb, Baptiste Veistroffer (Lotto) was joined in a seven-man move by Edoardo Zamperini (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Matt√©o Vercher (TotalEnergies), Sergio Meris (Unibet Tietema Rockets), Morn√© Van Niekerk (Van Rysel-Roubaix), and St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93 pair Dillon Corkery and Kenny Molly.</p>\n<p>As the break jumped clear up the road, EF Education-EasyPost were among the teams who settled in to control the peloton on behalf of their leader Richard Carapaz. The men in pink limited the break‚Äôs advantage to 1:30.</p>\n<p>Corkery was the first man to drop from the breakaway, letting go on the 6.7km climb of the Col de Ch√¢teauneuf as the peloton closed to within a minute of the leaders. They wouldn‚Äôt make the catch so early, however, instead letting the six remaining riders build their lead back up to the 1:30 mark.</p>\n<p>As the final 40km ‚Äì and the first climb up Gourdon (17.7km at 3.8%) ‚Äì began, though, the breakaway was quickly dragged back. By the 35km mark, it was over for the sextet, with EF bringing it all back together at the head of the race.</p>\n<p>The group went over the top of the climb all together, and it would take until the end of the descent, 18km from the finish, for the first major attack to come. Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) made the move, going clear on the downhill and pulling out a small gap before the start of the final ascent (13.9km at 3.9%).</p>\n<p>On the way back uphill, Vendrame pushed on to open up a 20-second gap. He hit the final 10km holding that advantage with EF massed on the front of the slimmed-down peloton in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Vendrame‚Äôs lead wouldn‚Äôt last to the top, however. EF dragged him back by the 8km mark, setting up a grand finale among the top climbers of the race. Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious) would be the man to launch that finale, going clear at 6.5km to go.</p>\n<p>With the peloton at that point totally blown apart, the Colombian was chased by groups of riders in ones and twos. His teammate Lenny Martinez was in the second group along with Cristian Scaroni (XDS-Astana), while Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) dropped a little further back to chase alone.</p>\n<p>With Martinez and Scaroni catching Buitrago at 5.5km to go, the Bahrain duo had the numbers to work against the Classic Var winner. Martinez briefly tried a move, though the trio settled in to work together and distance those chasing behind.</p>\n<p>That strong chase group included Carapaz, Guillaume Martin (Groupama-FDJ), Jarno Widar (Lotto), Aur√©lien Paret-Peintre (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Lorenzo Fortunato (XDS-Astana), Joseph Blackmore (Israel-Premier Tech).</p>\n<p>Martinez led the way into the final 4km, with the leading trio enjoying a 40-second lead on the chasers heading towards the finish. The Frenchman stuck on the front deep into the final kilometre, setting up a Buitrago vs Scaroni sprint finish.</p>\n<p>Scaroni launched from second wheel heading into the steep final 100 metres, taking Buitrago with him as the pair shot past Martinez to the line. But despite Bahrain having the numerical advantage, it was Scaroni who had the legs to come through and win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=111&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The nickname, Ruta del Sol, is in reference to the region&#8217;s popular tourist coastline the Costa del Sol.</p>\n<p>It was a day for the breakaway in southern Spain, as Equipo Kern Pharma‚Äôs Diego Uriarte took a stunning first professional victory on stage 4 of the Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista Del Sol.</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old was one of six riders in contention for victory after the early break and was able to stay clear all day, with UAE Team Emirates-XRG content to defend the overall lead of Pavel Sivakov. </p>\n<p>With just under two kilometres left to race, Uriarte launched a speculative early attack, but with the other riders looking at one another, he was able to cross the line first after just over four hours of racing to record a surprise win for his team.

After an aggressive start to the day, with many teams keen to be involved in the day‚Äôs breakaway, a 14-rider lead group was finally established, and they began to build their gap over the peloton. It was a relatively modest advantage of no more than 2:30 for most of the race however, as without a rider among the group, the Wagner Bazin WB team were driving the pace in the bunch, presumably in the hope of eventually making the catch.</p>\n<p>The day‚Äôs golden kilometre bonuses were divided amongst the breakaway riders with just over 70 kilometres remaining on the stage, too far from the stage finish to have any real impact on the overall classification.</p>\n<p>The gap to the front of the race dropped below two minutes for the first time with around 54 kilometres remaining, with the other team to have missed out on the break &#8211; the Mexican continental side Petrolike &#8211; adding their numbers to the chase, and allowing UAE to conserve their energy in defence of Sivakov‚Äôs lead. They were unable to make much headway, however, and in fact, the gap began to extend again as they moved closer to the finish, extending some hope to the 12 remaining breakaway riders.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final 25 kilometres, the deficit finally dropped below 1:30, but with UAE taking control at the front of the bunch, any hope left within the peloton of fighting for the stage win was extinguished as they put on the brakes, allowing the gap to swell and effectively neutralising the race from within the main bunch.</p>\n<p>At the head of the race, with the message presumably getting through that the peloton had sat up, the attacking began with around 17 kilometres to go.

A men&#8217;s event was first held in 2019 as part of the UCI World Tour. It was created as a result of the merging of the Abu Dhabi Tour and the Dubai Tour.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) sped to his second sprint win in two days at the UAE Tour, launching early on the curving finish straight at Abu Dhabi Breakwater to claim a dominant victory.</p>\n<p>The European champion came around the two-men sprint trains of Tudor and Alpecin-Deceuninck to jump early into the headwind and pull out a gap on his rivals in the closing metres of the race&#8217;s penultimate stage.</p>\n<p>Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was left to come through for a distant second place, while double stage winner Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) rounded out the podium a whisker further back.</p>\n<p>The finish came after several sprint teams fought to control the closing kilometres, with the remains of the day&#8217;s breakaway brought back 2.5km from the line.</p>\n<p>Picnic-PostNL and Lidl-Trek were among the teams with trains on the front speeding towards the line, but it was Tudor who hit the front inside the final kilometre. The Swiss squad wouldn&#8217;t have any joy in the closing sprint, however, with Merlier launching early and coming around the outside on the bending run to the line.</p>\n<p>Starting from a position much further back than his main rivals, Merlier was already at full speed and flying past before the likes of Philipsen and Milan could launch. The 32-year-old blasted through to hit the front and claim a dominant win as the other sprinters picked up the scraps behind him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was in the washing machine like they say. I found a gap at 300 to go and tried to surprise the others. The headwind was a really long effort, so I&#8217;m suffering,&#8221; Merlier said after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really difficult to organise. Also, my lead-out crashed yesterday so maybe it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to do real work today. But we tried what we could. We lost each other at 1.9km to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I missed him to make some space for me and I was boxed in, boxed in, boxed in all the time. I thought I wasn&#8217;t going to make it but I found a gap with 300 to go and then I just gave it a try and it was enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like every opportunity is an important one. I&#8217;m just happy with the win again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sunday&#8217;s final stage, the closing summit finish at Jebel Hafeet, now looms, with the battle for the red jersey set to erupt again.

A men&#8217;s event was first held in 2019 as part of the UCI World Tour. It was created as a result of the merging of the Abu Dhabi Tour and the Dubai Tour.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) sped to his second sprint win in two days at the UAE Tour, launching early on the curving finish straight at Abu Dhabi Breakwater to claim a dominant victory.</p>\n<p>The European champion came around the two-men sprint trains of Tudor and Alpecin-Deceuninck to jump early into the headwind and pull out a gap on his rivals in the closing metres of the race&#8217;s penultimate stage.</p>\n<p>Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) was left to come through for a distant second place, while double stage winner Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek) rounded out the podium a whisker further back.</p>\n<p>The finish came after several sprint teams fought to control the closing kilometres, with the remains of the day&#8217;s breakaway brought back 2.5km from the line.</p>\n<p>Picnic-PostNL and Lidl-Trek were among the teams with trains on the front speeding towards the line, but it was Tudor who hit the front inside the final kilometre. The Swiss squad wouldn&#8217;t have any joy in the closing sprint, however, with Merlier launching early and coming around the outside on the bending run to the line.</p>\n<p>Starting from a position much further back than his main rivals, Merlier was already at full speed and flying past before the likes of Philipsen and Milan could launch. The 32-year-old blasted through to hit the front and claim a dominant win as the other sprinters picked up the scraps behind him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was in the washing machine like they say. I found a gap at 300 to go and tried to surprise the others. The headwind was a really long effort, so I&#8217;m suffering,&#8221; Merlier said after the finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really difficult to organise. Also, my lead-out crashed yesterday so maybe it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to do real work today. But we tried what we could. We lost each other at 1.9km to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I missed him to make some space for me and I was boxed in, boxed in, boxed in all the time. I thought I wasn&#8217;t going to make it but I found a gap with 300 to go and then I just gave it a try and it was enough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Like every opportunity is an important one. I&#8217;m just happy with the win again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sunday&#8217;s final stage, the closing summit finish at Jebel Hafeet, now looms, with the battle for the red jersey set to erupt again.

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. Due to its early February position in the European calendar, it is used by many riders to prepare for the Spring Classics.</p>\n<p>Jordi Meeus (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) took a dramatic win amid a crash-marred final kilometre of stage 3 of the 2025 Volta ao Algarve in a mass sprint ahead of Alberto Dainese (Tudor Pro Cycling), who was later relegated for an incorrect manoeuvre, and Biniam Girmay (Intermarch√©-Wanty).</p>\n<p>The final 5km was a heated battle between the sprint trains of the major favourites, with Intermarch√©-Wanty, Visma-Lease a Bike and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe most conspicuously controlling the pace.</p>\n<p>Into the final kilometre, though, it was Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) who entered the field in the prime position, before Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) found his wheel to sit near the front of the peloton on the final approach to the finish line. The move perhaps came too early, as Dainese and Girmay shifted ahead of a fading Van Aert into the final straight.</p>\n<p>Chaos erupted as a crash to the left of the peloton took down a dozen riders near the front of the sprint, including a number of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe riders but thankfully sparing the sprinters positioned at the front of the field.</p>\n<p>Despite missing his supporting riders, though, Meeus follow a fortunate early sprint from Casper van Uden (Picnic-PostNL) before sweeping ahead of Girmay and Dainese in the final 100 metres.</p>\n<p>Dainese crossed the line in second place, but he was later relegated, meaning Girmay placed second and Arnaud De Lie moved up to third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was second already in my first race and I was really focused on the first stage here. Unfortunately, [it] didn&#8217;t work out as we all know but today was another opportunity,&#8221; Meeus said at the finish to Eurosport.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I started good, I felt good all day and the team did an amazing job so I&#8217;m super happy to finish it off. It was actually quite a hectic day all day, the hilly part there was also some wind with 35k&#8217;s to go so I was really nervous. Then after the bonus sprint we turned into headwind, I was surprisingly relaxed back then, and then the sprint preparations started. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Like I said, my team did an amazing job. It was still a bit hectic in the final with the corners and the roundabouts but I managed to position myself well and finish it off.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The top three riders in the general classification remained the same, with Jan Christen and Jo√£o Almeida holding a UAE Term Emirates-XRG 1-2 at the top of the order ahead of Ineos Grenadier&#8217;s Laurens de Plus. </p>\n<p>With fourth-placed Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL) crashing out of the race with 23km to go, Ant√≥nio Morgado (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) shifted into his spot and all the others in the top 10 moved up one spot as well, with Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) going into 10th.</p>\n<p>Van Aert, who won the same 183.5-kilometre stage to Tavira last year, was part of the bunch contesting the sprint, and finished seventh.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was super punchy in the final 3km,&#8221; Wout van Aert said after the finish. &#8220;I was in a good position toward the roundabout at 800, but before the last corner, I lost too many positions for a good sprint.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWarm if windy weather greeted the peloton at the start in the Portuguese border town of Vila Real de San Antonio. Last year&#8217;s stage winner in Tavira, Van Aert logically found himself at the centre of the media attention at the sign-on.</p>\n<p>A notably fast first hour, though, through the much more rugged opening half of the course did not prevent nine Portuguese riders and one Briton going clear, in what potentially constituted a serious challenge to the sprinters and WorldTour teams present. </p>\n<p>Glasgow&#8217;s Calum Johnston (Caja Rural), 9:14 back, nominally represented the most serious threat overall, but the allure of some time off the front and perhaps a breakaway win were the most obvious goals for the 10-man move, also containing  Gon√ßalo Oliveira (Anicolor-Tien 21), Bruno Silva (Tavfer-Ovos Matinados-Mortagua), Joaquim Silva (Efapel), Ivo Pinheiro (Feirense-Beeceler), Carlos Miguel Salgueiro (APHotels &#038; Resorts-Tavira-SC Farense) Noah Campos and Andr√© Ribeiro (GI Group Holding-Simoldes-UDO), Joao Oliveira (Credibom-LA Aluminios-Marcos Car) and C√©sar Fonte (Radio Popular-Paredes-Boavista).</p>\n<p>By the foot of the first of the day&#8217;s two classified climbs, the mid-stage category 3 Mercator, the 10 still held a solid three-minute gap. But the climb itself began to take its toll, with  Joao Oliveira one of the first to be dropped, and the remainder of the breakaway shedding time as well. </p>\n<p>Even before the last climb of the day, the Faz Fato, the entire front move was recaptured and the sprinters&#8217; teams, eager to prevent any late challenges, kept a strict eye on proceedings as the race moved towards the summit.</p>\n<p>After German Nicol√°s Tivani (Aviludo-Louetano-Loule) darted ahead over the top to recapture the lead in the mountains classification from Foia winner Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), EF Education-EasyPost led the pack off the descent. Delegations from Visma-Lease a Bike, Soudal-QuickStep and Groupama-FDJ were notably present, too, in the front part of the peloton as it zipped along a broad &#8216;A&#8217;-road back down from inland towards the very windy segment of Atlantic coastline.</p>\n<p>The unmistakeable figure of Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) at the head of affairs added yet more speed to the peloton as it moved into the final 30 kilometres, speeded along by a brisk tailwind and well-surfaced roads. After rattling through the cobbled boulevards and past the famous lighthouse in the start town of Vila Real for a second time, a 90-degree turn brought the pack onto the long series of straightaways leading to the finish in Tavira.</p>\n<p>Just as a crash brought down Bardet and Picnic-PostNL teammate Romain Combaud, Lidl-Trek put in their first concerted effort of the day on the front.</p>\n<p>With the peloton together and a flat 20km ahead, it was for the sprinters&#8217; teams to orchestrate their lead-out trains, and all eyes were on Intermarch√©-Wanty, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Visma‚ÄìLease a Bike.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=107&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. Due to its early February position in the European calendar, it is used by many riders to prepare for the Spring Classics.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG enjoyed a one-two finish on stage 2 of the Volta ao Algarve as Jan Christen won a high-octane summit finish, just ahead of teammate Jo√£o Almeida.</p>\n<p>Christen had been part of an initial group of six to go clear on the Alto da F√≥ia, but as Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked from the chasing group in the closing 2km it looked as if the GC favourites would win the day.</p>\n<p>But Christen dug deep and held on, while Almeida flew across the gap to distance Vingegaard and finish hot on the heels of his young teammate. Laurens de Plus (Ineos Grenadiers), another survivor of the day‚Äôs final breakaway, finished third, seven seconds back, with the trio also taking the top three positions on GC.</p>\n<p>In the first battle of the GC favourites this week, Almeida was the clear winner. The Portuguese rider goes into stage 3 with a 20-second lead over Vingegaard thanks to the bonus seconds available, with Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) ceding a further three seconds. Both Vingegaard and Rogliƒç had been left isolated on the Alto da F√≥ia, while Almeida still had Antonio Morgado for support and Christen up the road.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm super happy, it‚Äôs an amazing stage win,‚Äù Christen said at the finish. ‚ÄúAll in all the first part was quite easy, with the final climb it was all-in. Now [I‚Äôm] a bit speechless, to win such a climbing stage, especially with such a strong field at the start.

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. Due to its early February position in the European calendar, it is used by many riders to prepare for the Spring Classics.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG enjoyed a one-two finish on stage 2 of the Volta ao Algarve as Jan Christen won a high-octane summit finish, just ahead of teammate Jo√£o Almeida.</p>\n<p>Christen had been part of an initial group of six to go clear on the Alto da F√≥ia, but as Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) attacked from the chasing group in the closing 2km it looked as if the GC favourites would win the day.</p>\n<p>But Christen dug deep and held on, while Almeida flew across the gap to distance Vingegaard and finish hot on the heels of his young teammate. Laurens de Plus (Ineos Grenadiers), another survivor of the day‚Äôs final breakaway, finished third, seven seconds back, with the trio also taking the top three positions on GC.</p>\n<p>In the first battle of the GC favourites this week, Almeida was the clear winner. The Portuguese rider goes into stage 3 with a 20-second lead over Vingegaard thanks to the bonus seconds available, with Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) ceding a further three seconds. Both Vingegaard and Rogliƒç had been left isolated on the Alto da F√≥ia, while Almeida still had Antonio Morgado for support and Christen up the road.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm super happy, it‚Äôs an amazing stage win,‚Äù Christen said at the finish. ‚ÄúAll in all the first part was quite easy, with the final climb it was all-in. Now [I‚Äôm] a bit speechless, to win such a climbing stage, especially with such a strong field at the start.

Since 2005, it has been a 2.1 category race on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became a part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. The nickname, Ruta del Sol, is in reference to the region&#8217;s popular tourist coastline the Costa del Sol.</p>\n<p>Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling) was victorious on stage 2 of the Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista Del Sol, as he stormed to a fourth victory of the season for his new team.</p>\n<p>After an aggressive day of racing which saw the GC battle kick off with around 80km remaining on the stage, the final was contested between a group of five riders, coming down to a sprint which Pidcock led out, holding the rest at bay with a strong turn of pace at the finish.</p>\n<p>Brandon Rivera, of Pidcock‚Äôs former team, INEOS Grenadiers, came through in second place, while Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) rounded out the podium, finishing in third place for the second consecutive day.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman‚Äôs consistency was rewarded as he moved into the race lead, supplanting yesterday‚Äôs winner Maxim Van Gils (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe). The Belgian was caught out on the final descent from the day‚Äôs main climb and could not bridge back to the head of the race. He slips to fourth place in the GC, with Cl√©ment Berthet (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) in second overall and Pidcock moving into third.</p>\n<p>Speaking immediately after the race, Pidcock said: ‚ÄúToday I stayed calm, I rode smart, and now I‚Äôve won. Yesterday I was not disappointed but I rode stupid, I wasted a lot of energy in the race. I was riding too enthusiastically, which was a mistake on my part, and perhaps being a little bit too confident. So it was a nice reality check yesterday and today, I really raced smart, didn&#8217;t panic, let the race play out. And in the end it was perfect. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know I&#8217;m in great shape.

But this race is so hard, the climbs, and as you see today, we had five guys in the front with a two-minute gap at one point. It&#8217;s crazy how easily the race can explode. So anything can happen, we&#8217;ll see.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 2 of the Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista Del Sol was the longest of this year‚Äôs race at 133.2km. The day began in the town of Alcaudete, and the peloton headed north to Torredelcampo, via a number of climbs including three ascents of the category 2 Puerto de los Villares. </p>\n<p>It was another warm and sunny day in southern Spain and the action began from the flag drop, with a battle for the early break that eventually settled into a group of seven riders, though their advantage over the bunch was short-lived as the climbing began in earnest. </p>\n<p>The GC favourites began to exert their authority over proceedings with around 50km remaining. The bunch split and was spread along the road, with a strong group of riders at the head of the race, including Sivakov &#8211; in third overall at the start of the day &#8211; who had once again been part of the early break. Further back, overall leader Van Gils found himself with work to do.</p>\n<p>With the race favourites all over the road Pidcock took matters into his own hands, attacking with 49km remaining, though he was initially unable to drop Van Gils. Van Gils was the next to accelerate in the chasing group, and he and Pidcock vied for position, with Enric Mas (Movistar) just about managing to stick with them. Under the increased pace, the trio rapidly began to close the gap to the front of the race, and as they passed the summit and headed onto the descent, Pidcock attacked once again, bringing Mas with him, but finally distancing Van Gils.</p>\n<p>Just as he did in the previous stage, Pidcock used the long descent to his advantage. The Brit made the catch and joined the lead group along with Mas, swelling the group&#8217;s number to five. The virtual leader on the road was Sivakov, following his third place on stage 1, with Van Gils labouring alone with no teammates 30 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>With 26km remaining a chasing group of ten riders caught the yellow jersey. Luckily for Van Gils it included a teammate in the shape of Giovanni Aleotti, who powered past his leader and immediately began to set a ferocious tempo, with the rest of the chasers coming together in a group behind him.</p>\n<p>Despite Red Bull rallying for their leader, the gap to the head of the race remained at around 1:45. Van Gils looked set to lose his lead as the five in front stayed clear -despite some apparent conflict over the division of labour within the group, with Pidcock remonstrating with his former teammate Brandon Rivera (Ineos Grenadiers) for sitting on.</p>\n<p>Heading into the final the gap to Van Gils had crept out to two minutes. With 4km remaining, Mas was first to strike out from the lead group, though his acceleration was immediately neutralised by Pidcock. The tension was high as the group entered the narrow streets of Torredelcampo, and the pace dropped as the quintet began to look at one another, with the chase group behind rapidly closing the gap. </p>\n<p>Though both Sivakov and Berthet tried to attack, neither could make their move stick, and it would come down to a sprint for the line, which Pidcock won with relative ease.

Since 2017, it has been organised as a 2.HC event on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. Due to its early February position in the European calendar, it is used by many riders to prepare for the Spring Classics.</p>\n<p>Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) initially won the opening stage at the Volta ao Algarve after a bizarre final that saw the majority of the peloton enter the final stretch on the wrong side of the roadside median and barriers, through an unblocked deviation, and attempt to sprint among the crowds of fans lined up to watch the race at the finish line in Lagos.</p>\n<p>Race organisers later announced that they had cancelled the stage due to the confusion that occurred in the final few hundred metres of the 192.2km race from Portim√£o to Lagos.</p>\n<p>Ganna was among the few riders who made the correct deviation on the left side of the median and roadside barriers inside the final few hundred metres and so crossed the line solo, one second ahead of Romain Gr√©goire (Groupama-FDJ) and Jan Christen (UAE Team Emirates-XRG). </p>\n<p>Organisers stated that while they cancelled the stage results, they awarded Ganna leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I took the correct way, and the win,&#8221; Ganna initially said in a post-race winner&#8217;s interview, before organisers cancelled the stage results. &#8220;The stage was hard, long, warm but it was nice to be back here in Algarve. Everything I enjoy being back. Two years ago, I didn&#8217;t drop in the climbs. We will see now. It is steep so we will see what happens. It is important to arrive with a good feeling and we will see what more can happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It has been reported that as the lead commissaire and official&#8217;s vehicle were directed off the route deviation inside the final few hundred metres to the righthand side of the median and roadside barriers on a divided roadway, and that the majority of the peloton followed because the deviation was not adequately blocked off.</p>\n<p>Although a lead motorcycle official and marshal signalled to the peloton to deviate to the left, they appeared to have been positioned too far along the course for the peloton to see or react in time, according to reports.</p>\n<p>Marco Haller (Tudor Pro Cycling Team) reacted to the chaotic final saying that the officials and organisers need to face consequences for such a dangerous finish.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You could see that on the last kilometre, the deviation wasn&#8217;t blocked by the officials, and obviously when the riders are coming, they follow the motorbikes, like they always do. And for me, it&#8217;s pretty ridiculous because we suffered 190km to put ourselves in the perfect position and then it is basically everything for nothing,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is a joke. Something where there need to be consequences for the officials and the organisers because it cannot always be the riders who are to blame. We are in the heat of the moment, it is a race situation, and it is frustrating. It is always the same finish, but this is why we have fences, we have officials, and motorbikes who guide us, that was just poor. It is very frustrating for all of the riders because we want to have the best one to win it and not by chance.&#8221; </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe identical opening stage to 2024, running in a broad loop first inland from Portim√£o and then back along the Algarve coastline to the nearby coastal town of Lagos, began in warm, sunny weather. </p>\n<p>Expectations that the multiple local Continental squads, lacking sprinters to take on the WorldTour teams but well represented in the sizable 175-strong peloton, would be key factors in the early breakaway attempts &#8211; and those predictions proved to be fully correct.</p>\n<p>Gon√ßolo Oliveira (Anicolor-Tien), Francisco Morais (Tavfer-Ovos Matinados-Mortagua), Victor de Paula (Feirense-Beeceler), Carlos Miguel Salgado and Francisco Campos (AP Hotels&#038;Resorts/Tavira/SC Farense), Noah Campos (GI Group Holding-Simoldes-Udo), Diego Narciso (Credibom/LA Aluminios/Marcos Car) and German Nicolas Tivani (Aviludo-Louletano-Loule) formed part of the one major break to go clear early in the day. </p>\n<p>The average speed over the rolling Algarve hinterland was a brisk 43 kph for the first hour, and 44 for the second, but as the eight Continental riders approached the one categorised climb of the day, the category 3 Nave, they still had an advantage of well over three minutes. That was ample time for Argentina&#8217;s Tivani to pick up the only KOM mountain points on offer and, too, for the chasing peloton to slowly pick up the pace as it headed down towards the Atlantic coastline again.</p>\n<p>The increase in speed saw the eight ahead form a more cohesive collaboration at least as far as the final 50 kilometres, helped by the relatively straightforward route and steady speed. </p>\n<p>Lotto, working for Arnaud de Lie, and Intermarch√©-Wanty, doing exactly the same for Biniam Girmay, made much of the running behind, squeezing the gap to just over a minute before the breakaway started to panic and fell apart.</p>\n<p>Salgueiro, the only rider with a teammate in the break, charged away alone in a solo bid to defy the overriding bunch sprint narrative of the stage, and he swiftly chipped out an extra 20-second advantage. That said, the dragging ascent to a coastal headland that followed was far from ideal terrain for such a move, particularly as EF Education-EasyPost were now also involved in the chase. </p>\n<p>With nothing to lose, though, Salguiero still made it solo as far as the intermediate sprint at Vila do Bispo, and the second group were only a bare half-minute behind. However, a broad, smooth highway was all the bunch needed to use their superior firepower and force a general regrouping with 23 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Tudor Pro Cycling, Q36.5, Ineos Grenadiers, Lotto and EF Education-EasyPost set the pace at the front of the field into the final 20km, stretching the peloton into the finale. Meanwhile, some of the general classification favourites like Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) appeared to remain alone but safely near the front.</p>\n<p>Lotto led the peloton into the final roundabouts inside the last 1km and another with 700 metres to go, and it appeared that the field would contest a bunch sprint.

Since 2005, it has been a 2.1 category race on the UCI Europe Tour. The race became a part of the new UCI ProSeries in 2020. The nickname, Ruta del Sol, is in reference to the region&#8217;s popular tourist coastline the Costa del Sol.</p>\n<p>Maxim Van Gils took his first victory in the colours of his new team, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, on a challenging opening day at the Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista del Sol. The Queen stage of the race, stage 1 set the tone for the remaining four days of racing, with Van Gils assuming control of the yellow leader‚Äôs jersey, on the same time as Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).</p>\n<p>It was a strong showing from UAE, who had two out of three riders in the trio that contested the race final, and finished the day with three riders in the top four. Wellens and Pavel Sivakov used their numerical advantage repeatedly in an attempt to drop Van Gils, but the 25-year-old Belgian held his nerve and remained with the duo heading under the flamme rouge.</p>\n<p>With Sivakov spent from his earlier efforts in the breakaway, Wellens and Van Gils went head-to-head up the final punchy climb in Cueva de Nerja, a leg-snapping 400m uphill effort which saw the pair separated by just one wheel length as they crossed the line. Sivakov rounded out the podium, with Marc Soler finishing fourth, leading a group of GC favourites that included Q36.5 Pro Cycling‚Äôs Tom Pidcock.</p>\n<p>Van Gils said after his victory: ‚ÄúIt was a super hard stage, and also pretty hot, and I think everybody felt their legs. There was not really a team that can control the race. UAE had multiple leaders, and they were shooting the shot. So I had to anticipate.  </p>\n<p>‚ÄúI know Tim pretty well. I know I can beat him in a sprint. So it was just really important to not let them go and try to keep them together and predict everything on my final sprint.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúToday is really special, I was really motivated to start the way I ended it last year. And I&#8217;m really proud of myself today,</p>\n<p>‚Äú[UAE] have a really strong team here. I&#8217;m a little bit afraid, but I hope my team can handle it as well.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing a year which saw the race almost entirely cancelled due to farmers‚Äô strikes in the region, the Vuelta a Andalucia Ruta Ciclista Del Sol was back in full for 2025, with five rolling stages across the Andalucia region of southern Spain. </p>\n<p>The parcours was front-loaded, the Queen stage taking place on day one and setting the scene for the rest of the race. The 162.6km challenge beginning in Torrox and concluding in Cueva de Nerja featured almost no flat roads whatsoever along its distance, with the peloton heading up and down all day, as they rode towards a final uphill drag to the finish line.</p>\n<p>There were two non-starters prior to the race ‚Äì AJ August (INEOS Grenadiers) and Vegard Stake Laengen (UAE Emirates-XRG), so 113 riders rolled out of Torrox and it was a group of eight riders which comprised the day‚Äôs early break, accruing an advantage of just over four minutes over the bunch.</p>\n<p>The status quo did not last for long though, with a series of tough climbs along the profile, and while the break fought it out for KOM points over the first four categorised climbs, they were unable to stay together as the relentless ups and downs began to take their toll on the legs.</p>\n<p>Back in the bunch, Q36.5 Pro Cycling took on the pace-setting early in the stage on behalf of their leader Tom Pidcock. Though as the race wore on, UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe added their weight to the chase, and the Emirati side sent Pavel Sivakov ahead as a satellite rider, where he joined the remains of the early breakaway.</p>\n<p>At the head of the race, Thomas Silva (Caja Rural-Seguros-RGA) and Andreas Leknussund (Uno-X Mobility) were the final survivors from the early break, but heading into the final 40 kilometres of the race Leknussund moved into the solo lead. Behind, the peloton fractured into several groups as the gradients continued to exact their revenge, with a small group of GC favourites coalescing as the race progressed over the rolling green Andalucian hills and back towards the coast. </p>\n<p>Leknussund‚Äôs lead sat at 40 seconds from Sivakov and Silva with 38 kilometres remaining, but with the peloton over a minute behind, Pidcock launched an attack to try and close the leaders down, drawing out a select group. The British rider used his daredevil descending skills to briefly gap the rest of the group, but they were able to reel him back in as the road levelled out. The group was 12-strong and as the road began to rise once again, the gap tumbled, with Pidcock, Van Gils and Clement Berthet (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) coming to the fore. </p>\n<p>With Sivakov caught, Van Gils led the charge to try to close down Leknussund with 20km remaining, but Sivakov was able to latch onto the Red Bull rider as the pair were joined by Tim Wellens. The trio shut down the courageous effort from Leknussund and moved into the lead on the final categorised climb of the day, the third category Alto de Frigiliana, with a series of small groups spaced along the road behind.</p>\n<p>Heading onto the descent, Van Gils overcooked a corner and ended up off the road, putting the UAE pair in pole position. He fought his way back on though and an entente cordiale held as the final kilometres ticked away, and with the chase group unable to close the gap, the victory would be decided among the lead trio. Wellens used two successive roundabouts to attempt to drop Van Gils, followed by a series of one-two attacks, but the UAE duo was unable to shift the confident Belgian, who clearly backed himself on the final drag up to the line. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=110&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=110&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Part of me hoped that Tarling would hold on to the bunch and he would keep the jersey, but I will be more than happy to have the leader‚Äôs jersey tomorrow instead of the rainbows.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not finished yet. We have three flat stages, and you never know what happens here. You can lose it really quickly, so nothing is won yet. Tomorrow is the middle point of the race, so we have more than halfway to go.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe third stage of the UAE Tour brought potentially the decisive stretch of road of the week ‚Äì the 19km long climb of the Jebel Jais, the UAE‚Äôs highest peak, which featured an average gradient of 5.6% to conclude the 181km day.</p>\n<p>An entirely flat run-in to the mountain would bring two intermediate sprints and little else. That didn‚Äôt stop five riders from jumping clear right at the very start of the stage, with VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√® trio Manuele Tarozzi, Lorenzo Conforti, and Federico Biagini joined by Solution Tech-Vini Fantini duo ƒêorƒëe ƒêuriƒá and Carlos Samudio.</p>\n<p>The quintet was let go without any fight from the peloton, as UAE Team Emirates-XRG and Ineos Grenadiers settled in to control the pacemaking behind.</p>\n<p>Up front, the break built up a two-minute lead, with black jersey Tarozzi set for a battle with Samudio over the sprint points as both lay on 11 heading into the day, nine down on Josh Tarling and Jonathan Milan.</p>\n<p>The first sprint at Al Marjan Island saw ƒêuriƒá take the maximum eight points ahead of Tarozzi‚Äôs five and Samudio‚Äôs three. The trio quickly dropped back to Conforti and Biagini to reform the five-man move, pushing on towards the second sprint and the closing climb.</p>\n<p>At the front, the attacks began at 50km to go as Tarozzi and ƒêuriƒá made moves. The attacks and counters would eventually leave Samudio and Biagini clear off the front, the pair all set to contest the final sprint.</p>\n<p>There, it was Samudio who led the way across the line, picking up eight points to take him to 22 and ensure the Panamanian would don the black jersey at the end of the stage. The remains of the break would all be swept up before the start of the climb, meanwhile, leaving the duo to lead the race onto Jebel Jais.</p>\n<p>At the base of the climb, Samudio and Biagini‚Äôs two-minute lead had been cut down to just over 30 seconds after UAE, Ineos, and Lotto had upped the pace in the chase. Meanwhile, there was bad luck for Einer Rubio (Movistar), who lost over 1:30 to a slow bike change just as the climb was getting underway.</p>\n<p>Samudio and Biagini lasted just 700 metres of the climb as UAE reeled them in, with the Italian lasting a touch longer before the breakaway was done for the day. At the front, it was Mikkel Bjerg, Florian Vermeersch, and Domen Novak who were hard at work on the front pushing the pace as rider after rider dropped from the rear of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Vermeersch‚Äôs work was done at the 13km mark, leaving Bjerg and Novak at the head of the peloton with Pogaƒçar having dropped a little further back into the group out of the wind. Meanwhile, Rubio‚Äôs long chase came to an end as he made his way back in.</p>\n<p>At 11km to go, Jay Vine had moved up front to aid Novak in the pacemaking, though Bjerg continued on the front of the 40-man group. The Dane pushed on until the 7km mark, at which point he pulled off as Novak took over with Lotto, Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale, and Ineos Grenadiers lined up behind.</p>\n<p>It was Decathlon AG2R who took over with four riders when Novak stopped his work at 4.2km to go. By that point, around 20 men were left in the group, including a Pogaƒçar still lying midway down the pack.</p>\n<p>It was Felix Gall who made the first big attack of the climb, jumping clear with 2km to run. Vine, with Pogaƒçar in his wheel, quickly shut the move down, however, bringing it all back together for the final run to the line.</p>\n<p>Further back, Tarling was struggling to stay in contact, and would be forced to let go from the front, ceding his red jersey along the way. Up front, Vine continued to lead the way, only dropping off the front within sight of the line to launch Pogaƒçar to his stage-winning effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9800&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9800&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It was created as a result of the merging of the Abu Dhabi Tour and the Dubai Tour.</p>\n<p>Josh Tarling (Ineos Grenadiers) came out on top in the stage 2 time trial at the UAE Tour. The 21-year-old sped through the 12.2km flat course at an average speed of 56.671kph to claim his first victory of the 2025 season and with it the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>Tarling was fastest at the day&#8217;s single intermediate checkpoint and at the finish, setting a time of 12:55 at the line.

He got the ball rolling for us and I was trying to be confident.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was really windy. The first part was really a headwind and then there was a long crosswind section. The first part was the hardest and then we got a bit of respite with the corners towards the end, so it was kind of two halves.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Hopefully I get a bit of confidence back now, and I&#8217;m excited for the rest.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tarling&#8217;s victory sees him take over the top of the general classification heading into stage 3&#8217;s summit finish at Jebel Jais.</p>\n<p>He now leads Bissegger by 13 seconds and Pogaƒçar, the race favourite, by 18 seconds. Tarling also leads the points and youth classifications, while Manuele Tarozzi (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®) remains in the black jersey as sprints leader.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar) had been the early pacesetter on Al Hudayriyat Island, setting a time of 13:21 to go quickest among the very first starters. His time would be good for seventh after all was said and done.</p>\n<p>Another early starter was Pogaƒçar. The Slovenian was the 13th man down the start ramp and bettered Romeo&#8217;s time to go top of the standings. His 55.385kph run saw him go eight seconds faster, a time that would hold until Bissegger went out 12 riders later.</p>\n<p>Tarling was another early starter among the 139 riders in the UAE peloton. He was the 31st man to take on the course, and with it set the only time of the day under 13 minutes. Of course, his time wouldn&#8217;t be beaten, with few top-tier TT specialists left to run.</p>\n<p>Other riders did manage to put up good times, though. Pablo Castrillo (Movistar) set a time of 13:22 just before Tarling came home, with the Spaniard&#8217;s time leaving him in sixth for the day.</p>\n<p>Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) was another solid performer. He was fourth at the finish with a time of 13:16 and he&#8217;ll go into the third stage 21 seconds down on Tarling.</p>\n<p>Max Walscheid (Jayco-AlUla) in fifth with a 13:19, Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) in eighth with a 13:34, Florian Vermeersch (UAE Emirates-XRG) in ninth with a 13:34, and Finn Fisher-Black (UAE Emirates-XRG) in 10th with a 13:35 rounded out the top-10 finishers.</p>\n<p>Several GC names to look out for this week stayed in touch just outside the top finishers. Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek) finished 12th with a time of 13:37, while Carlos Rodriguez (Ineos Grenadiers) came home a second later in 14th, reigning champion Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto) took 17th with a 13:41, while Felix Gall (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) was 26th at 13:46.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9800&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9800&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is organized by southern French newspaper La Provence, which serves as the race&#8217;s title sponsor for its first three years. It is held in February, as a 2.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour calendar and became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) won the 2025 Tour de la Provence after the peloton caught a late and determined attack in the final kilometre on the road to Arles in the South of France, sparking a hectic sprint finish.  </p>\n<p>Sam Bennett (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) came late to win the stage, avoiding the chaos behind him. Marijn van den Berg (EF Education-EasyPost) was second and Alexander Konijn (Nice M√©tropole C√¥te d&#8217;Azur) was third </p>\n<p>Pascal Ackermann (Israel-Premier Tech) appeared to hit a speed bump in the road and lost control of his bike just 100 metres from the finish, sparking a high-speed crash amongst the sprinters. Israel-Premier Tech said Ackermann suffered road rash and superficial wounds but did not suffer any fractures. </p>\n<p>Pedersen avoided the crash and finished ninth and so secured overall victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was a good day, it was a fast day in the peloton. A strong breakaway got away late in the race and it was hard to catch them back. But we and other teams managed it. We ended up in the sprint we wanted. We didn&#8217;t get the result but we still got the GC, so all is good,&#8221; Pedersen explained.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it was Ackermann who crashed and when he went down, of course, you slam on the brakes, you don&#8217;t want to go down yourself. That destroyed the sprint for me but I&#8217;m happy I didn&#8217;t go down.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;I still have some work to do, I&#8217;m not at my best yet. There&#8217;s still two months until Paris-Roubaix.&#8221;   </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final stage of the Tour de La Provence was the flattest of the race, offering a long day and 190km in the saddle. </p>\n<p>Strangely, the early attacks were all chased down, with the peloton together even after a fast opening 70km of racing. It was a sign the finish would be fast and furious. </p>\n<p>A slowing in the peloton inspired an attack and suddenly Ra√πl Garcia Pierna (Ark√©a-B&#038;B H√¥tels), Samuel Leroux (TotalEnergies), C√©riel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB), Daniel Smajkic √Örnes (Van Rysel-Roubaix), Matisse Julien (CIC U Nantes) and Damien Girard (Nice M√©tropole C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur) got away. They quickly opened a two-minute lead.  </p>\n<p>Garcia Pierna was an overall threat and so the peloton kept them under control. However the attackers refused to give up hope and worked together in a slick and efficient paceline.  </p>\n<p>Garcia Pierna was eventually dropped in the final 10 kilometres, but the others pushed on, taking the fight to the peloton. Lidl-Trek did some of the work but with GC virtually assured they forced others to lead the chase and so Israel-Premier Tech and Unibet Tietema Rockets massed on the front in the final kilometres. </p>\n<p>The gap to the attackers was still significant as they entered the final five kilometres but the peloton could see them and sensed an opportunity for another sprint show down. </p>\n<p>Israel-Premier Tech had several sprint options but their hopes ended when Ackermann hit the speed bump in the final hundred metres and lost control of his bike. Others riders piled into him, disrupting the sprint. </p>\n<p>Bennett was to the right and slightly ahead of the crash, giving him a clear run at the line. He did not hesitate and reproduced the speed that gave him victory on stage 1 in Saint-Victoret.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4396&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4396&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4396&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=4396&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Pedersen earned 15 bonus seconds during the stage and for his win and so took the race leader&#8217;s jersey from Sam Bennett (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>The Dane now has a 13-second margin over Mohoriƒç and 24 seconds over Wright in the GC with one stage to go.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you have a strong group behind pulling, chasing you, it&#8217;s never safe until you pass the finish line. So I would say the last &#8216;k&#8217; I was sure we would sprint for the victory, but you are never sure,&#8221; Pedersen explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m in good shape and it was a nice feeling today.

Another solo move from TotalEnergies, this time from Samuel Leroux, followed.</p>\n<p>Leroux&#8217;s move was a strong one, with the Frenchman holding his gap and extending it on the uphill drag leading towards the final 10km.

The Frenchman dug deep to get back on their wheel but then Yates accelerated again inside the final kilometre and Gaudu was unable to stay with them.</p>\n<p>Paret-Peintre was Yates&#8217; match, though and then surged away after the final curve to win the stage. Yates finished a few bike lengths behind but knew he had done enough to win overall. Gaudu finished 45 seconds down.</p>\n<p>Yates pulled on the final red leader&#8217;s jersey, finishing the Tour of Oman six seconds ahead of Paret-Peintre, with Gaudu slipping to third place overall at 39 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 138.5km stage included a valley road loop but was all about the mountain finish on the slopes of Jabal Al Akhdar &#8211; Green Mountain, which ends with six kilometres of climbing at an average of 9.9%.</p>\n<p>After some early attacks, a 17-rider move eventually went clear, that included 2023 Green Mountain winner Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep), his teammate Pepijn Reinderink and other riders keen for a day of adventure and hard racing.</p>\n<p>Groupama-FDJ and UAE Team Emirates-XRG knew they had to control the move and their teammates launched a controlled but high-speed chase. The break worked well together, with other riders sensing an opportunity of success. The opening two hours of racing were covered at an average of 45.4 km/h.  However the pursuit was equally determined, with the Continental JCL Team UKYO helping to set up Nahom Zeray.</p>\n<p>The attackers started the climb to the finish with only a minute, perhaps knowing it would not be enough. Vansevenant surged early to try to hold off the GC contenders and so the attack fell apart even before the steep final six kilometres. Jos√© Luis Faura (Burgos Burpellet BH) and Lucas Eriksson (Tudor Pro Cycling) joined Vansevenant but the Yates group was only 30 seconds behind.</p>\n<p>Australia&#8217;s Jay Vine played a key role for Yates in the final four kilometres. He helped close down the attackers and hurt the GC group. Damien Howson (Q36.5) crashed just as the steep slopes of Green Mountain began to take their toll and was forced to chase back on. He would finish seventh on the stage and fourth overall.</p>\n<p>Gaudu began to suffer and after Vine completed his turn, Yates made his first surge. It hurt Gaudu even more and only Paret-Peintre could follow him, as everyone else faded due to the gradient and the midday heat.</p>\n<p>Yates eased when Paret-Peintre matched him, playing a calculated strategy. That allowed Gaudu to gradually close the gap but it was a significant effort.</p>\n<p>The Groupama-FDJ racer tried to go shoulder to shoulder with Yates in a show of pride and determination but as they passed the red kite sign for the final kilometre, Yates increased his power and speed, dropping Gaudu again, this time for good.</p>\n<p>Paret-Peintre was again able to stay with Yates, opting to spin his legs to fight the gravity. Yates tried to gradually crack him but the 2024 Giro d&#8217;Italia stage winner was strong. </p>\n<p>After the final sweeping curve he could see the finish line and danced away on the pedals to take his first win for Soudal-QuickStep. Yates finished two seconds down on Paret-Peintre but knew overall victory was his for a second consecutive year.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Dutchman launched out into the wind in the closing 200 metres and charged past.</p>\n<p>Behind Kooij, Nizzolo was in the next best position to challenge, but he didn‚Äôt have the time or the speed to get up to the 23-year-old, and so he had to settle for second place. Orluis Aular (Movistar) rounded out the podium ahead of Blikra in fourth, while Max Kanter (XDS Astana) took fifth place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was good for me. We could control the finish with the team, and they helped me very well,&#8221; Kooij said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAfter coming from the winter in Europe, it takes some time to get used to [racing], but the feelings are good.&#8221;</p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe knew the last kilometre would be important to get in a good position. I could then follow the right wheels to start my sprint at exactly the right moment.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Stage 4 was a largely flat one with no classified climbs and 607 metres of elevation spread across its 181.5km. As a result, only three riders ventured out into the breakaway.</p>\n<p>Abdulrahman Alyaqoobi (Oman National Team), Kongphob Thimachai (Roojai Insurance), and Muhammad Mohd Shabri (Terengganu) were the men in question, with the peloton happy to leave the trio to ride well up the road.</p>\n<p>The break led the way across the day‚Äôs two intermediate sprints, at one point leading by a margin of over nine minutes, though at the second sprint in Ad Dasur, 64km from the finish, Alyaqoobi had already been displaced from the move and caught by the peloton.</p>\n<p>At 45km to go, Mohd Shabri was back with the main group, leaving Thimachai out on his own two minutes up the road. Behind him, sprinter‚Äôs teams including Picnic-PostNL and Visma-Lease A Bike led the peloton ahead of the expected bunch finish.</p>\n<p>Thimachai battled on alone into the final 20km of the stage, hanging on to an ever-decreasing gap before finally being brought back at 13km to go. From there, it was all up to the sprint squads.</p>\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep and UAE Team Emirates-XRG joined the fray at the front, while Groupama-FDJ and Uno-X Mobility also had spells at the head of the race in the final<br />\nfive kilometres. It was Uno-X and Visma who led the way into the uphill final kilometre of the stage, however.</p>\n<p>Uno-X controlled the run-in with Stian Fredheim leading out Blikra for the dash to the finish line, though it was Kooij who had the faster finish from Blikra‚Äôs wheel.</p>\n<p>After taking the victory on Monday‚Äôs stage 3 up Eastern Mountain, David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) retains the overall race lead, six seconds up on Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates-XRG).

However, Gaudu found another gear and kicked home for the win.</p>\n<p>Damien Howson (Q36.5) was third on the stage five seconds behind Gaudu, with Valentin Paret-Peintre (Soudal-QuickStep) taking fourth.</p>\n<p>The latter&#8217;s teammate Louis Vervaeke, who started the day in the race leader&#8217;s jersey after his breakaway win on stage 2, fought valiantly but ceded the lead when he was dropped in the final 3km.</p>\n<p>Thanks to his winning margin and ten bonus seconds gained for the victory, Gaudu moved into the overall lead, just six seconds ahead of Yates with two stages left to race. The GC will be decided on the final day to Green Mountain.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy with this win because it&#8217;s my first this season and the first for the team. It was a very good day with the boys and I&#8217;m very proud of the work they did. They put it all on the table so I&#8217;m happy to finish the work, it&#8217;s incredible,&#8221; said gaudu.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never won a GC in my life as a professional so now we have tomorrow a flat stage for sprinters and after we have the last stage, maybe the queen stage up Green Mountain so we are already focussed on that to try to keep the jersey and maybe win a second stage.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter three days of racing in Oman at the Muscat Classic and opening two days of the Tour of Oman, racing kicked off from Fanja with 180.8km and Eastern Moutain on the menu.</p>\n<p>Without the parcours offering much and full focus on the uphill finish, a six-man break was quickly allowed to form in the opening 20km.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Vinokurov (XDS Astana), Rayan Boulahoite (TotalEnergies), Nur Amirul Fakhruddin Mazuki (Terengganu), Andreas Miltiadis (Roojai Insurance), Said Alrahbi and Mohammed Al-Wahibi (Oman) all made it in and the gap grew to more than three minutes.</p>\n<p>Slowly they dropped one by one until only Vinokurov and Bolahoite, the two riders on professional teams remained. The former was the strongest of the original move, however, lasting all the way until 2km to go up the final climb. </p>\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep had been doing the majority of pacing as the holder of the race leader&#8217;s jersey, with Vervaeke even pulling in red for their main climber Paret-Peintre.</p>\n<p>However, Groupama-FDJ then showed their hand and confirmed that Gaudu was feeling strong as they moved to the front and put in a huge effort to catch Vinokurov and line things out.</p>\n<p>Yates looked spritely in the wheels and was the first to respond when Gaudu attacked. The Frenchman continued on applying the pressure, though, and went into the final 150 metres with the Brit close behind. </p>\n<p>It looked certain that Yates was going to come over the top in the grinding uphill sprint, however, Gaudu hadn&#8217;t given everything yet and still had enough to pull away for the win, coming to a complete stop after the all-out effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First organized in 1971 as a one-day race, it became a stage race run over five days in 1974. Since 2005, it is on the calendar of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event and features as the earliest stage races of the European season.</p>\n<p>The final stage time trial at the 2025 Etoile de Besseges was taken by Kevin Vauquelin of Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels the final stage, doubling up on stage wins and the overall general classification with a dominant ride winning the stage by 19‚Äù over Remi Cavagna of Groupama-FDJ and Dylan Teuns of Cofidis. </p>\n<p>The fifth and final stage of the race was an individual time trial in the town of Ales with an uphill finish to the hermitage. Kevin Vauquelin (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) held a healthy 51‚Äù advantage over his closest rival, Nicolas Breuillard (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93), with a 10.6km route with a 10% climb to the stage finish to decide the winner. </p>\n<p>Thankfully for the riders, after two days of horrendous weather, the sunshine had come back out again. The first rider off the ramp was Dylan Massa (Nice M√©tropole C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur). Out of the early finishers, it was Oliver Knight (Cofidis) who led the way with a time of 15‚Äô52‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Knight was eventually beaten by 19-year-old Maxime Decomble (Groupama-FDJ) putting 20‚Äù into the young British rider. However, Decomble was soon beaten by his teammate, Remi Cavagna.</p>\n<p>The former French road and time trial champion put in a very strong performance. He topped the standings with Thibault Guernalec (Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels) splitting him and Decomble.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of the top times were set by riders who were also involved in the fight for the General Classification. Several in the GC top 10 found their names slotting into the top 10 on the stage. </p>\n<p>None of the riders in the four leader‚Äôs jerseys actually wore the jerseys as there weren‚Äôt any skinsuits available for them to wear so they all raced in their own team skinsuits for the race. </p>\n<p>Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) put in a very solid ride, slotting into the top 10 and solidifying his position in the final GC. Shortly after Latour, the Cofidis rider Dylan Teuns put in a very strong time to go into second place just 2‚Äù down on Cavagna.</p>\n<p>The time by Teuns actually was good enough to leap over Kevin Geniets (Groupama-FDJ) in the General Classification with the rider from Luxembourg losing almost 17‚Äù to the former Fleche Wallonne winner. </p>\n<p>However, both Teuns and Geniets jumped above the new French climbing sensation of Nicolas Breuillard (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93) who slipped down the GC losing almost a minute. </p>\n<p>After Breuillard finished off his effort he was soon followed by Vauquelin who was storming to the finish with an exceptionally strong ride to take the stage by 19‚Äù over Cavagna with a time of 15‚Äô07‚Äù. </p>\n<p>This stage win adding to his win the day before on the Mont Bouquet mean that he comfortably took the final overall general classification by well over a minute on Teuns and the rest with former second overall, Breuillard, dropping to fifth overall. </p>\n<p>Vauquelin took the time trial in 2024 as well but missed out on the overall win by just 2‚Äù to Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek). Pedersen left the race early this year due to illness, shortly followed by his team and eight others who left with safety concerns. </p>\n<p>The race wasn‚Äôt what the organisers would have wanted with multiple incidents with the public driving on the course, rider protests, teams pulling out and atrociously bad weather conditions. But, the race was completed with a superb ride by 23-year-old Vauquelin.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Elinor Barker (Uno X-Mobility) was the only one to string out a gap, with SD Worx-Protime parked on the front to shut down other attempts.

By the time of his attack over Al Jissah, the breakaway contained Magnus Kulset (Uno-X Mobility) and Azparren, both of whom were swallowed up by the peloton before the final 5km.</p>\n<p>Attacks came from the main group, including a major move by David Gaudu (Groupama‚ÄìFDJ) to bridge the narrow gap to the Belgian solo rider, but the moves were brought back within the final 5km, when the bunch began to aggressively chip into Vervaeke&#8217;s one-minute lead.</p>\n<p>However, despite an animated chase, the peloton was left only metres behind the Belgian on the finish line in Yitti Hills, as crosswinds and chaos in the sprint saw multiple riders crash in the final 300m.</p>\n<p>Completing an excellent day for Soudal-Quickstep, Vervaeke&#8217;s teammate Valentin Paret-Peintre took the sprint for second place ahead of Sean Flynn (Picnic-PostNL).</p>\n<p>Alongside the stage victory, the solo win delivered Vervaeke into the overall race lead, ahead of Paret-Peintre in second place at a gap of 6 seconds, ahead of Flynn at a margin of 8 seconds.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a beautiful day for me, it feels incredible to take my first win as a pro,&#8221; Vervaeke said after the race. &#8220;I came close several times in the past, and to finally pull it off makes me very proud.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking of his final attack, he said, &#8220;In the final ten kilometers of the stage I was empty, but I kept thinking of my family and immediately found the power to press on and give my best until the end.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That‚Äôs why I pointed to the tattoo on my right arm when crossing the line, because being a rider means making a lot of sacrifices, both yourself and your family.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also want to thank my team, because they gave some valuable help from behind when the chase was on, and this only shows again the Wolfpack spirit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He praised the team&#8217;s performance and explained that the focus will now switch to the general classification. &#8220;It‚Äôs great to get a 1-2 with the team, especially as we came here to win a stage and we‚Äôre now delighted to have it. From tomorrow, we‚Äôll focus on the general classification with Valentin and Mauri.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tomorrow the rider will tackle a mountainous 180.8km route from Fanja to the Eastern Mountain, meaning a likely reordering of the general classification.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=57&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Today, I was mainly focused on gaining bonus seconds to take the leader&#8217;s jersey, and to be honest, the win was quite unexpected,&#8221; Buitrago said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought it would be a day for the sprinters, like our former teammate Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek), but in the finale, I was at the front with Pello (Bilbao), and we decided it was worth trying. I accelerated, went all in, and made it happen. It&#8217;s incredible‚Äîwe thought it would be difficult to take back seconds in the GC, and instead, we took both the stage win and the leader&#8217;s jersey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek), led out for the stage by teammate Jakob S√∂derqvist, finished a distant second place at 12 seconds while the Swede finished third in the uphill dash to the line after turning himself inside out to hold onto the lead group in the final kilometres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was super tough &#8211; we managed it really well,&#8221; Milan said. &#8220;I was dropped a few times and the team always brought me back. I was always on the limit. In the end, we were in a good position. Jakob had really good legs today and had a little gap in the last 500m. I was thinking he could [win] because he was feeling better than me. Then I saw Buitrago coming from behind super fast. I tried to ride my own pace for the 400 metres still to ride to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Buitrago now leads Almeida by eight seconds in the overall classification with teammate Pello Bilbao in third at 29 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nFour climbs were on tap during the 181-kilometre stage 4 of the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, with riders set to climb the Alto de la Bandereta, Col del la basa, Alto de Chodos and Alto de Vistabella before the finish in Portell de Morella.</p>\n<p>Five riders dropped out of the race before the stage: Lars Boven (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers), I√±igo Elosegui (Kern Pharma) and Xabier Isasa and Mikel Bizkarra (Euskaltel-Euskadi). Not far into the stage, another Euskaltel rider abandoned, M√°rton Dina.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from kilometre zero, with Hugo Houle (Israel-Premier Tech) and Diego Uriarte (Kern Pharma) emerging from a group of a dozen to form the first escape. They were joined by Jon Agirre (Euskaltel-Euskadi) and were quickly given a maximum lead of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>Agirre led over the first climb, while Uriarte led over the Coll de la Basa and through the sprint in Atzeneta del Maestrat after 75.2km.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates, Lidl-Trek and Movistar cooperated to bring the breakaway&#8217;s lead down to two minutes before the Alto de Chodos, and sensing the danger, Agirre attacked solo with 93km to go.</p>\n<p>He led over the Alto de Chodos to tie for the lead of the mountains classification with Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious).

Today, I was mainly focused on gaining bonus seconds to take the leader&#8217;s jersey, and to be honest, the win was quite unexpected,&#8221; Buitrago said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought it would be a day for the sprinters, like our former teammate Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek), but in the finale, I was at the front with Pello (Bilbao), and we decided it was worth trying. I accelerated, went all in, and made it happen. It&#8217;s incredible‚Äîwe thought it would be difficult to take back seconds in the GC, and instead, we took both the stage win and the leader&#8217;s jersey.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jonathan Milan (Lidl-Trek), led out for the stage by teammate Jakob S√∂derqvist, finished a distant second place at 12 seconds while the Swede finished third in the uphill dash to the line after turning himself inside out to hold onto the lead group in the final kilometres.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was super tough &#8211; we managed it really well,&#8221; Milan said. &#8220;I was dropped a few times and the team always brought me back. I was always on the limit. In the end, we were in a good position. Jakob had really good legs today and had a little gap in the last 500m. I was thinking he could [win] because he was feeling better than me. Then I saw Buitrago coming from behind super fast. I tried to ride my own pace for the 400 metres still to ride to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Buitrago now leads Almeida by eight seconds in the overall classification with teammate Pello Bilbao in third at 29 seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nFour climbs were on tap during the 181-kilometre stage 4 of the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, with riders set to climb the Alto de la Bandereta, Col del la basa, Alto de Chodos and Alto de Vistabella before the finish in Portell de Morella.</p>\n<p>Five riders dropped out of the race before the stage: Lars Boven (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers), I√±igo Elosegui (Kern Pharma) and Xabier Isasa and Mikel Bizkarra (Euskaltel-Euskadi). Not far into the stage, another Euskaltel rider abandoned, M√°rton Dina.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew from kilometre zero, with Hugo Houle (Israel-Premier Tech) and Diego Uriarte (Kern Pharma) emerging from a group of a dozen to form the first escape. They were joined by Jon Agirre (Euskaltel-Euskadi) and were quickly given a maximum lead of eight minutes.</p>\n<p>Agirre led over the first climb, while Uriarte led over the Coll de la Basa and through the sprint in Atzeneta del Maestrat after 75.2km.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates, Lidl-Trek and Movistar cooperated to bring the breakaway&#8217;s lead down to two minutes before the Alto de Chodos, and sensing the danger, Agirre attacked solo with 93km to go.</p>\n<p>He led over the Alto de Chodos to tie for the lead of the mountains classification with Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious). Agirre was still solo on the Alto de Vistabella, where there was a time bonus sprint at the summit.</p>\n<p>However, the action began to pick up in the peloton on the climb, with Lenny Martinez (Bahrain Victorious) and Davide Piganzoli (Polti-Visit Malta) making a move before being quickly reeled in.

The peloton was severely reduced in the abysmal weather as the race got closer and closer to the Mont Bouquet. </p>\n<p>The break was caught right at the bottom of Mont Bouquet with Groupama-FDJ taking over the pacing onto the climb.

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE ADQ) moved into the overall lead of the UAE Tour Women with a dominant win on stage three.</p>\n<p>The Italian made her attack 3.2km from the finish at the top of the Jebel Hafeet climb, and soloed all the way to the line to claim her first win for her new team for 2025, UAE ADQ. </p>\n<p>Better yet, her teammate Silvia Persico sealed a one-two for UAE ADQ by winning the sprint for second from a case group of five that arrived 36 seconds later, ahead of Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla-Jayco), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM) and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health). </p>\n<p>Borghini inherits the overall lead from winner of the first two stages, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx &#8211; Protime), who was dropped much earlier on the climb. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe can really call it a masterpiece from Team ADQ,‚Äù proclaimed Borghini at the finish. ‚ÄúToday we had a clear goal, and it was the victory and the red jersey. All the team did amazing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Having put herself in a strong position by getting herself in the front echelon of yesterday‚Äôs crosswind-affected stage, Borghini was hot favourite to take the overall lead today. The main hazard was the potential for more action in crosswinds again during the early phase of the stage prior to the final climb, but her team remained attentive when there were some brief splits in the wind. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere was a moment when Siliva [Persico] and I were caught out of the main echelon,‚Äù she explained. ‚Äú[Elynor] B√§ckstedt brought us back within a second. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen the whole team did a great job to position us in the best position possible into the climb. After that, Persico just rode at a good tempo.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace on the Jebel Hafeet was enough to thin the group of favourites down to just nine riders, distancing overall leader Lorena Wiebes and GC rivals Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ) and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike). </p>\n<p>5.5km from the top, Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) made an attack, with Borghini the only rider to follow. The move was short-lived, however, as the rest of the 9-woman group rejoined shortly after ‚Äî including Persico, who resumed her pace-setting at the front.</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace continued to cause damage, with Garc√≠a, Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) and Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), the next to be dropped, leaving her and Borghini with just Niedermaier, Malcotti, Trinca Colonel and Le Court for company. </p>\n<p>Then with 3.2km to go Borghini made her attack, to which none of the others had any answer to.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt very comfortable the whole climb. When I felt like it was the right time, I just attacked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis was a crazy day. I really wanted to win my first victory for the team. I wanted us to win because a few weeks ago my family lost a friend, and that‚Äôs for him. We are pretty happy with the entire performance from Team UAE ADQ.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With only one stage left and a 2-09 lead on GC over her teammate Persico in second and 2-11 over Le Court in third, Borghini should be able to seal overall victory tomorrow. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor sure, we want to win this Tour and try to defend the red jersey until the very end of the race. It‚Äôs going to be a nice day tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage three of the UAE Tour was the only mountain stage of the race, and therefore the 10.7km finishing climb to Jebel Hafeet was expected to be the definitive moment in the GC race.</p>\n<p>This climb was not the only obstacle of the day, however, as the riders once more ventured far into the desert to face the kind of exposed roads that could host havoc if the wind blew.</p>\n<p>At the start of the day, it took a long time for a break to go. In fact, the peloton was still together by the time of the first intermediate sprint of the day 45km into the stage, meaning the GC contenders fought for the bonus seconds on offer. Borghini missed out in fourth, but her teammate Lara Gillespie did prevent Juliette Labous and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot from taking the maximum. </p>\n<p>The lull after that sprint allowed three riders to get up the road: Hannah Ludwig (Cofidis), Petra Zsank√≥ (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Nora Jenƒçu≈°ov√° (BePink &#8211; Imatra &#8211; Bongioanni), Before long, they had established themselves as the break of the day, and built a lead of around three minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that gap began to fall 90km from the finish as the pace in the peloton increased significantly in anticipation of potential crosswinds. The gaps were made at the back of the peloton rather than from out the front, and none of the top GC contenders were caught out, but the action was enough to see the three riders caught 78km from the finish.</p>\n<p>After another lull lasting about 10km, things kicked off again 67km from the finish, as a group of a dozen riders used the wind to go off the front of the peloton. Just like yesterday, Borghini, Wiebes and Lily Williams (Human Powered Health) made the split, along with big names Ferrand Prevot, Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Things did calm down again, however, and they were brought back 55km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Capitalising on the slow-down that followed, Cofidis initiated a new attack 27km from the finish, with their duo of Victoire Berteau and Amalie Dideriksen going clear with Marta Lach (Team SD Worx &#8211; Protime).</p>\n<p>However, with such a stern test to come in the shape of the Jebel Hafeet, this attack was always likely to be short-lived, and they were all brought back once the elite climbers came to the fore on its uphill slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the third edition of the UAE Tour Women, and the third race of the 2025 UCI Women&#8217;s World Tour.</p>\n<p>Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE ADQ) moved into the overall lead of the UAE Tour Women with a dominant win on stage three.</p>\n<p>The Italian made her attack 3.2km from the finish at the top of the Jebel Hafeet climb, and soloed all the way to the line to claim her first win for her new team for 2025, UAE ADQ. </p>\n<p>Better yet, her teammate Silvia Persico sealed a one-two for UAE ADQ by winning the sprint for second from a case group of five that arrived 36 seconds later, ahead of Kimberley Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal), Monica Trinca Colonel (Liv AlUla-Jayco), Antonia Niedermaier (Canyon-SRAM) and Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health). </p>\n<p>Borghini inherits the overall lead from winner of the first two stages, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx &#8211; Protime), who was dropped much earlier on the climb. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe can really call it a masterpiece from Team ADQ,‚Äù proclaimed Borghini at the finish. ‚ÄúToday we had a clear goal, and it was the victory and the red jersey. All the team did amazing.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Having put herself in a strong position by getting herself in the front echelon of yesterday‚Äôs crosswind-affected stage, Borghini was hot favourite to take the overall lead today. The main hazard was the potential for more action in crosswinds again during the early phase of the stage prior to the final climb, but her team remained attentive when there were some brief splits in the wind. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThere was a moment when Siliva [Persico] and I were caught out of the main echelon,‚Äù she explained. ‚Äú[Elynor] B√§ckstedt brought us back within a second. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúThen the whole team did a great job to position us in the best position possible into the climb. After that, Persico just rode at a good tempo.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace on the Jebel Hafeet was enough to thin the group of favourites down to just nine riders, distancing overall leader Lorena Wiebes and GC rivals Juliette Labous (FDJ-SUEZ) and Pauline Ferrand-Prevot (Visma-Lease a Bike). </p>\n<p>5.5km from the top, Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco) made an attack, with Borghini the only rider to follow. The move was short-lived, however, as the rest of the 9-woman group rejoined shortly after ‚Äî including Persico, who resumed her pace-setting at the front.</p>\n<p>Persico‚Äôs pace continued to cause damage, with Garc√≠a, Dilyxine Miermont (Ceratizit) and Nienke Vinke (Picnic PostNL), the next to be dropped, leaving her and Borghini with just Niedermaier, Malcotti, Trinca Colonel and Le Court for company. </p>\n<p>Then with 3.2km to go Borghini made her attack, to which none of the others had any answer to.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI felt very comfortable the whole climb. When I felt like it was the right time, I just attacked.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis was a crazy day. I really wanted to win my first victory for the team. I wanted us to win because a few weeks ago my family lost a friend, and that‚Äôs for him. We are pretty happy with the entire performance from Team UAE ADQ.‚Äù</p>\n<p>With only one stage left and a 2-09 lead on GC over her teammate Persico in second and 2-11 over Le Court in third, Borghini should be able to seal overall victory tomorrow. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúFor sure, we want to win this Tour and try to defend the red jersey until the very end of the race. It‚Äôs going to be a nice day tomorrow!‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage three of the UAE Tour was the only mountain stage of the race, and therefore the 10.7km finishing climb to Jebel Hafeet was expected to be the definitive moment in the GC race.</p>\n<p>This climb was not the only obstacle of the day, however, as the riders once more ventured far into the desert to face the kind of exposed roads that could host havoc if the wind blew.</p>\n<p>At the start of the day, it took a long time for a break to go. In fact, the peloton was still together by the time of the first intermediate sprint of the day 45km into the stage, meaning the GC contenders fought for the bonus seconds on offer. Borghini missed out in fourth, but her teammate Lara Gillespie did prevent Juliette Labous and Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot from taking the maximum. </p>\n<p>The lull after that sprint allowed three riders to get up the road: Hannah Ludwig (Cofidis), Petra Zsank√≥ (CERATIZIT Pro Cycling Team) and Nora Jenƒçu≈°ov√° (BePink &#8211; Imatra &#8211; Bongioanni), Before long, they had established themselves as the break of the day, and built a lead of around three minutes.</p>\n<p>However, that gap began to fall 90km from the finish as the pace in the peloton increased significantly in anticipation of potential crosswinds. The gaps were made at the back of the peloton rather than from out the front, and none of the top GC contenders were caught out, but the action was enough to see the three riders caught 78km from the finish.</p>\n<p>After another lull lasting about 10km, things kicked off again 67km from the finish, as a group of a dozen riders used the wind to go off the front of the peloton. Just like yesterday, Borghini, Wiebes and Lily Williams (Human Powered Health) made the split, along with big names Ferrand Prevot, Chloe Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) and Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n<p>Things did calm down again, however, and they were brought back 55km from the finish.</p>\n<p>Capitalising on the slow-down that followed, Cofidis initiated a new attack 27km from the finish, with their duo of Victoire Berteau and Amalie Dideriksen going clear with Marta Lach (Team SD Worx &#8211; Protime).</p>\n<p>However, with such a stern test to come in the shape of the Jebel Hafeet, this attack was always likely to be short-lived, and they were all brought back once the elite climbers came to the fore on its uphill slopes.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First organized in 1971 as a one-day race, it became a stage race run over five days in 1974. Since 2005, it is on the calendar of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event and features as the earliest stage races of the European season.</p>\n<p>Despite the shocking weather, rider protests, course changes and various teams leaving the Etoile de Bess√®ges 2025, the race continued and saw Arnaud De Lie of Lotto power to victory ahead of Arnaud Demare of Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels and Paul Penhoet of Groupama-FDJ.</p>\n<p>The third stage of the race was based around the town of Bess√®ges with the start and finish there with an original route of 164km. However, due to another car driving onto the course the riders protested and the race was shortened to 136km. This removed the local lap around the town.</p>\n<p>Following the protest, several teams decided to leave the race instead of restarting. They were the team of race leader, Paul Magnier, Soudal-QuickStep as well as Uno-X Mobility, Decathlon-AG2R, Lidl-Trek, EF Education-EasyPost, Ineos Grenadiers, Unibet Tietema Rockets and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.</p>\n<p>It was a wet start for the riders in a crisp six degrees celsius. The race kicked off on the first climb of the day, the Col de Tr√©lis.</p>\n<p>St Michel-Preferance Home-Auber93 rider, Th√©o Delacroix, launched on a solo breakaway over the top of the first climb. At the base of the second climb, the Col des Brousses, the riders stopped. Discussions were started with the race organisers and jury president. </p>\n<p>The first two stages had seen issues with cars and lorries being able to get onto the course and the police then had to get the riders to divert around them. Even with one car driving towards the peloton.</p>\n<p>The third stage was yet another incident involving a car. This time, the peloton came face-to-face with a car on a roundabout. They immediately stopped and refused to continue racing. </p>\n<p>After a lot of negotiation between the race and the rider‚Äôs union, it was agreed to continue racing and the stage was shortened. However, multiple teams decided that, due to safety concerns, they would leave the race. </p>\n<p>Multiple riders attacked when the race restarted with Oliver Knight (Cofidis) with Valentin Retailleau (TotalEnergies), Hugo Aznar (Kern Pharma) and Antoine Hue (CIC-U-Nantes) joining him with a maximum gap of over a minute and a half. </p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, the bunch was led by Groupama-FDJ, Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels, Cofidis and TotalEnergies as they looked to set up their sprinters at the finish. </p>\n<p>It became very active on the final climb of the day, the Col des Brousses, with Cofidis, St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93, Groupama-FDJ, TotalEnergies all tried to cause splits. </p>\n<p>The splits came and a group managed to bridge across to the breakaway including Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis), Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) and Kevin Geniets (Groupama-FDJ).</p>\n<p>It looked like Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels were closing it down. However, Kevin Vauquelin made a move to try and bridge to the leaders. Unfortunately, for him, he dragged the entire Cofidis team and Belgian national champion Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) across with him. </p>\n<p>The carnage continued as Dylan Teuns (Cofidis) launched an attack with two others chasing in the final 18km. The chasers were caught and Teuns continued his solo effort but was caught with just under 5km to go. </p>\n<p>A late attack by Pierre Latour (TEN) brought Teuns back with a roundabout on wet roads seeing Latour‚Äôs challenge end.

First organized in 1971 as a one-day race, it became a stage race run over five days in 1974. Since 2005, it is on the calendar of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event and features as the earliest stage races of the European season.</p>\n<p>Despite the shocking weather, rider protests, course changes and various teams leaving the Etoile de Bess√®ges 2025, the race continued and saw Arnaud De Lie of Lotto power to victory ahead of Arnaud Demare of Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels and Paul Penhoet of Groupama-FDJ.</p>\n<p>The third stage of the race was based around the town of Bess√®ges with the start and finish there with an original route of 164km. However, due to another car driving onto the course the riders protested and the race was shortened to 136km. This removed the local lap around the town.</p>\n<p>Following the protest, several teams decided to leave the race instead of restarting. They were the team of race leader, Paul Magnier, Soudal-QuickStep as well as Uno-X Mobility, Decathlon-AG2R, Lidl-Trek, EF Education-EasyPost, Ineos Grenadiers, Unibet Tietema Rockets and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe.</p>\n<p>It was a wet start for the riders in a crisp six degrees celsius. The race kicked off on the first climb of the day, the Col de Tr√©lis.</p>\n<p>St Michel-Preferance Home-Auber93 rider, Th√©o Delacroix, launched on a solo breakaway over the top of the first climb. At the base of the second climb, the Col des Brousses, the riders stopped. Discussions were started with the race organisers and jury president. </p>\n<p>The first two stages had seen issues with cars and lorries being able to get onto the course and the police then had to get the riders to divert around them. Even with one car driving towards the peloton.</p>\n<p>The third stage was yet another incident involving a car. This time, the peloton came face-to-face with a car on a roundabout. They immediately stopped and refused to continue racing. </p>\n<p>After a lot of negotiation between the race and the rider‚Äôs union, it was agreed to continue racing and the stage was shortened. However, multiple teams decided that, due to safety concerns, they would leave the race. </p>\n<p>Multiple riders attacked when the race restarted with Oliver Knight (Cofidis) with Valentin Retailleau (TotalEnergies), Hugo Aznar (Kern Pharma) and Antoine Hue (CIC-U-Nantes) joining him with a maximum gap of over a minute and a half. </p>\n<p>Back in the peloton, the bunch was led by Groupama-FDJ, Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels, Cofidis and TotalEnergies as they looked to set up their sprinters at the finish. </p>\n<p>It became very active on the final climb of the day, the Col des Brousses, with Cofidis, St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93, Groupama-FDJ, TotalEnergies all tried to cause splits. </p>\n<p>The splits came and a group managed to bridge across to the breakaway including Benjamin Thomas (Cofidis), Pierre Latour (TotalEnergies) and Kevin Geniets (Groupama-FDJ).</p>\n<p>It looked like Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels were closing it down. However, Kevin Vauquelin made a move to try and bridge to the leaders. Unfortunately, for him, he dragged the entire Cofidis team and Belgian national champion Arnaud De Lie (Lotto) across with him. </p>\n<p>The carnage continued as Dylan Teuns (Cofidis) launched an attack with two others chasing in the final 18km. The chasers were caught and Teuns continued his solo effort but was caught with just under 5km to go. </p>\n<p>A late attack by Pierre Latour (TEN) brought Teuns back with a roundabout on wet roads seeing Latour‚Äôs challenge end. It was Groupama-FDJ who took control of the bunch leading out Penho√´t. The young French sprinter wasn‚Äôt able to hold off the charge of De Lie and D√©mare who outsprinted him to the line with De Lie winning the stage. </p>\n<p>With just 13 out of the 21 teams left in the race the fourth stage should be slightly different to what was originally expected as the Queen Stage to the Mont Bouquet beckons. De Lie is the new race leader, but there is still plenty of climbing talent left in the race. </p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=106&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Eventually, as the road turned into a headwind stretch, the peloton eased off, and the lead ballooned up, reaching in excess of three minutes at its highest point.</p>\n<p>As the race swung back onto exposed roads about 60km from the finish, the chase began again in earnest in the peloton, and the gap began to come down rapidly. </p>\n<p>It looked as though the quintet might be in danger of being caught after all, until around 30km from the finish, when the gap stabilised at about one minute. </p>\n<p>Wiebes was less worried about what time they were gaining, and more about winning the stage. Ultimately, her alert move to latch onto the group at the very start of the day just as a gap was about to open helped secure her victory. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn‚Äôt expect that,&#8221; she reflected at the finish, &#8220;especially as for a long time the peloton was really close to us. I think I was one of the last ones who could jump over to this group at the beginning. In the headwind part, we got a minute, and we kept on going.

It was easy for me to sprint.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By the time the five arrived on the finishing straight, another stage victory at Al Mirfa, where she also triumphed at the 2023 edition, seemed inevitable for her.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a sprinter, you are never 100% sure.

It‚Äôs going to be hard for anyone to stop Longo Borghini, now that she has gained so much time on all of her rivals. </p>\n<p>As for the likes of Ashleigh Moolman (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco), who arrived in a group behind the main peloton, their hopes of winning the GC are now surely over. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nWith the wind blowing strongly, the riders almost sprinted out of the neutralised zone at the beginning of this 111km trek through the desert, from Al Dhafra Fort to Al Mirfa. </p>\n<p>Wiebes, Borghini, Swinkels, Gillespie and Williams pulled clear within the first few kilometres, igniting a breathless chase between themselves and the peloton.</p>\n<p>Their lead remained steady at over a handful of seconds, very clearly in the sight of the peloton on the long straight roads. As the wind continued to blow, the peloton split into various groups, with two large groups forming behind the main peloton.</p>\n<p>With 98km to go the first trailing group rejoined the peloton, and 8km later the other trailing group also managed to rejoin.</p>\n<p>At this point the quintet ahead still had a lead of less than 30 seconds, but the coming together of the groups behind, and a change of direction into a headwind, seemed to take the wind out of the sails of the chase.

The other big-name overall contenders were scattered across a minute.</p>\n<p>Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) went deep to try to keep the leader&#8217;s yellow jersey. He finished 13th, only 57 seconds down on Buitrago and so kept the race lead by just a few seconds, thanks to Lidl-Trek&#8217;s dominant victory in the stage 1 team time trial.</p>\n<p>Almeida is only two seconds down on Vacek, with Buitrago third overall at five seconds.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious lost 1:11 to Lidl-Trek in the stage 1 team time trial but Buitrago and Bilbao pulled back time on many of his overall rivals before more hilly stages to Alpuente and then Portell de Morella.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 166km second stage from La Nuc√≠a to Benifato (Font de Partegat) visited the training roads many riders use during winter training camps near the Costa Blanca, Alicante and the Valencia region.</p>\n<p>The early climbs made a perfect springboard for attacks before a ride along the coastline and back into the hills.</p>\n<p>Riders from the US Project Echelon Racing team were active and went on the attack but five riders eventually got away and were given their freedom. They were Samuele Zoccarato (Polti VisitMalta), Maty√°≈° Kopeck√Ω (Team Novo Nordisk), Sinuh√© Fern√°ndez (Burgos Burpellet BH), Quentin Bezza (Wagner Bazin WB) and Vicente Rojas (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Zoccarato became the virtual race lead as Lidl-Trek controlled the peloton and allowed the break to open a four-minute lead.</p>\n<p>The race changed with 65km to go when the race hit the Coll de Rates, the now famous training climb, where Tadej Pogaƒçar took the Strava record in December with a team effort and powerful ride. </p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG and especially Ivo Oliveira took over on the front of the peloton, reducing the gap to the breakaway. The break soon fell apart on the climb, with only Kopeck√Ω and Fern√°ndez staying clear. They made it over the top of the climb but were within sight on the fast, sweeping descent.</p>\n<p>The peloton came back together with 25km to go as the final climb neared. The 5.5km Benimantell formed the first step up to the finish, with the subsequent climb to Alto de Partegat some 4.3km long but at 9.4%.</p>\n<p>Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) took off alone at this point as the British team lived up to their promise to race more aggressively. He opened a 20-second gap and forced rival teams to show their hand. Behind, Almeida rode on the front, splitting the chase group and hurting everyone, as many riders suffered on their 2025 debut and first big race effort.</p>\n<p>Foss made it to the Benimantell KOM but Almeida&#8217;s surge eventually drew out Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) and Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar). They then jumped across to Foss and the trio began the Alto de Partegat with a handful of seconds.</p>\n<p>The trio opened a 15-second gap and seemed likely to stay clear but Almeida did some more huge turns and refused to let them go. Foss and then Romeo cracked but Bilbao pushed on and seemed in control, even if the gap fell gradually as the gradient steepened.</p>\n<p>Perhaps ordered by his Bahrain Victorious team car or instinctively, Buitrago took off alone with 600 metres to go. He dropped Almeida and everyone else, cruelly surged past Bilbao and won the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The other big-name overall contenders were scattered across a minute.</p>\n<p>Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) went deep to try to keep the leader&#8217;s yellow jersey. He finished 13th, only 57 seconds down on Buitrago and so kept the race lead by just a few seconds, thanks to Lidl-Trek&#8217;s dominant victory in the stage 1 team time trial.</p>\n<p>Almeida is only two seconds down on Vacek, with Buitrago third overall at five seconds.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious lost 1:11 to Lidl-Trek in the stage 1 team time trial but Buitrago and Bilbao pulled back time on many of his overall rivals before more hilly stages to Alpuente and then Portell de Morella.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 166km second stage from La Nuc√≠a to Benifato (Font de Partegat) visited the training roads many riders use during winter training camps near the Costa Blanca, Alicante and the Valencia region.</p>\n<p>The early climbs made a perfect springboard for attacks before a ride along the coastline and back into the hills.</p>\n<p>Riders from the US Project Echelon Racing team were active and went on the attack but five riders eventually got away and were given their freedom. They were Samuele Zoccarato (Polti VisitMalta), Maty√°≈° Kopeck√Ω (Team Novo Nordisk), Sinuh√© Fern√°ndez (Burgos Burpellet BH), Quentin Bezza (Wagner Bazin WB) and Vicente Rojas (VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizan√®).</p>\n<p>Zoccarato became the virtual race lead as Lidl-Trek controlled the peloton and allowed the break to open a four-minute lead.</p>\n<p>The race changed with 65km to go when the race hit the Coll de Rates, the now famous training climb, where Tadej Pogaƒçar took the Strava record in December with a team effort and powerful ride. </p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates-XRG and especially Ivo Oliveira took over on the front of the peloton, reducing the gap to the breakaway. The break soon fell apart on the climb, with only Kopeck√Ω and Fern√°ndez staying clear. They made it over the top of the climb but were within sight on the fast, sweeping descent.</p>\n<p>The peloton came back together with 25km to go as the final climb neared. The 5.5km Benimantell formed the first step up to the finish, with the subsequent climb to Alto de Partegat some 4.3km long but at 9.4%.</p>\n<p>Tobias Foss (Ineos Grenadiers) took off alone at this point as the British team lived up to their promise to race more aggressively. He opened a 20-second gap and forced rival teams to show their hand. Behind, Almeida rode on the front, splitting the chase group and hurting everyone, as many riders suffered on their 2025 debut and first big race effort.</p>\n<p>Foss made it to the Benimantell KOM but Almeida&#8217;s surge eventually drew out Pello Bilbao (Bahrain Victorious) and Iv√°n Romeo (Movistar). They then jumped across to Foss and the trio began the Alto de Partegat with a handful of seconds.</p>\n<p>The trio opened a 15-second gap and seemed likely to stay clear but Almeida did some more huge turns and refused to let them go. Foss and then Romeo cracked but Bilbao pushed on and seemed in control, even if the gap fell gradually as the gradient steepened.</p>\n<p>Perhaps ordered by his Bahrain Victorious team car or instinctively, Buitrago took off alone with 600 metres to go. He dropped Almeida and everyone else, cruelly surged past Bilbao and won the stage.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

First organized in 1971 as a one-day race, it became a stage race run over five days in 1974. Since 2005, it is on the calendar of the UCI Europe Tour as a 2.1 event and features as the earliest stage races of the European season.</p>\n<p>The second stage of the Etoile de Besseges 2025 was taken by S√∏ren W√¶renskjold of Uno-X Mobility with an incredible sprint showing amazing speed to beat Arnaud Demare of Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels and Paul Magnier of Soudal-QuickStep to the line with Magnier keeping the leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>The second stage of the Etoile de Besseges began in Domessargues with a lumpy route of just under 166km to the finish in Marguerittes. The 20-year-old French sprinter, Paul Magnier (Soudal-QuickStep), started in the orange leader&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>A breakaway of five riders formed very quickly with leader of the King of the Mountains, Axandre Van Petegem (Wagner Bazin WB), getting out front for a second day in a row. He was joined by Louis Kitzki (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Victor Vercouillie (Flander-Baloise), Yohann Simon (AUB) and Ma√´l Gu√©gan (CIC-U-Nantes). The maximum gap the break were allowed was four minutes.</p>\n<p>The majority of the work in the peloton was done by Soudal-QuickStep, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Unibet Tietema Rockets for their main men for the sprint.</p>\n<p>In the break it was mountains jersey wearer, Van Petegem, who took the first three KoM sprints ahead of his rival in that competition, Vercouillie as they continued their battle from stage one. With Van Petegem extending his tally to 24 points over Vercouillie&#8217;s 16 points.</p>\n<p>When the race crossed the finish line for the first of two times the gap was just over a minute between the break and the peloton with just under 40km to go as the peloton began turning the screw as the final look had a few little climbs along the route.</p>\n<p>Into the final 30km and different teams started to move up in the peloton pushing out the teams that had controlled all day. Decathlon-AG2R, Lotto, Uno-X Mobility, Arkea-B&#038;B Hotels, TotalEnergies and EF Education-EasyPost took over all in colour order.</p>\n<p>The gap was closing rapidly but, suddenly, a member of the public came onto the road in their car and was driving towards the peloton.

But, it was neutralised very quickly.</p>\n<p>Vercouillie took the maximum points over the top of the final climb with 8km to go and closed the gap to Van Petegem by just two points. The descent off the C√¥te Cabri√®res was very technical and the peloton shut the break down with just over 5km to go.</p>\n<p>Soudal-QuickStep took complete control in the final 4km for the race leader, Magnier, as the race took on more technical roads.

But there are still two stages to come, so I need to keep going.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the team did a really good job to put us into position. It was chaotic, as expected. But we went well into the next corner, and then Marta and Barbara did a good job to do the lead out and drop me off at a good point.

I felt strong all the way to the finish.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nMany of the leading riders in the world assembled in the Middle East for the third leg of the 2025 Women‚Äôs World Tour. Today was the first of four stages of the UAE Tour, and, taking place over flat roads, was anticipated to be a day for the sprinters. </p>\n<p>Crosswinds could have complicated that, given the exposed nature of the wide open desert roads, but conditions were calm and the peloton remained together. </p>\n<p>Setting off from Dubai‚Äôs police officers club, Linda Laporta (BePink-Imatra-Bongioanni) was the first rider to make a move as she set off on a solo attack. Sylvie Swinkels (Roland) and Cristina Tonetti (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) formed a chasing duo behind but did not manage to catch her prior to the first intermediate sprint of the day situated 32km into the stage, allowing Laporta to take maximum points.</p>\n<p>Those three riders eventually came together, and a relaxed chase in the peloton allowed them to gain a lead that exceeded eight minutes at its height. </p>\n<p>That left the break to contest the second intermediate sprint, 66km from the finish. This time Tonetti took the spoils, coming round Swinkels before the line after Tonetti had been caught and passed following an early attack. </p>\n<p>It was on the approach to this intermediate sprint that the peloton began to chase in earnest, with SD Worx-Protime among the teams to move to the front. Their work saw the gap between them and the leading trio plummet rapidly, from over seven minutes about 70km from the finish, to a mere 1-30 at 50km to go.</p>\n<p>With 52km to go, there was a large high-speed crash towards the front of the peloton, with over 20 riders going down. Among those to fall were Mavi Garc√≠a (Liv AlUla Jayco), Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek) and Ashleigh Moolman (AG Insurance-Soudal), although nobody appeared too badly hurt. However, Letizia Paternoster (Liv AlUla Jayco) was forced to abandon as a result. </p>\n<p>That crash took some of the impetus out of the chase, as the pace slackened and those caught out made their way back into the peloton. A large group of chasers rejoined about 40km from the finish, at which point the break still led by over a minute. </p>\n<p>The leading trio fought on, remaining out front while the peloton bided their time in bringing them back. </p>\n<p>Laporta was the first to be swept up 11km from the finish after she didn‚Äôt have the legs to respond to an acceleration from Swinkels. Swinkels and Tonetti still had plenty of energy left and managed to hold off the bunch for a while longer, before finally being caught 3km from the finish. </p>\n<p>The final sprint then unfolded with a strong SD Worx-Protime lead-out guiding Wiebes around the final right-hand bend with 700 metres to go, before she easily outsprinted Kool for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Swinkels and Tonetti still had plenty of energy left and managed to hold off the bunch for a while longer, before finally being caught 3km from the finish. </p>\n<p>The final sprint then unfolded with a strong SD Worx-Protime lead-out guiding Wiebes around the final right-hand bend with 700 metres to go, before she easily outsprinted Kool for the win.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=18130&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Their leader and new signing Ben O&#8217;Connor finished the day as the best-placed general classification rider.</p>\n<p>Other teams racing for GC favourites such as UAE Team Emirates and Ineos Grenadiers finished the stage 50 and 51 seconds down on Lidl-Trek respectively but sit within striking distance of O&#8217;Connor with four days of racing to come.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really great feeling,&#8221; said Vacek after moving into the race lead.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the finish, our gap was about 50 seconds and it&#8217;s just crazy what we did today. We aim high but a win is of course something special for us and for the team. We are super confident now for the next stages but today we enjoy our victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Vacek isn&#8217;t a climber by any means, his versatility does make him an option for the GC. He was realistic with his ambitions with three climbing days approaching, however, didn&#8217;t rule out trying to win the race overall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was not really decided that I should pass the finish line first but I was in first position before the downhill and I stayed there until the finish and I&#8217;m proud that I can wear the yellow jersey now for the next stage,&#8221; he said, revealing that he wasn&#8217;t necessarily the leader.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say that I really am going to win the next stages but I will try to keep the jersey as long as possible. Of course, I have a good gap to the other guys but for sure it will be hard racing with some tough climbs so I&#8217;ll see how I feel but I&#8217;ll leave it all out there to keep the yellow jersey.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nBasque team Euskaltel-Euskadi kicked off the action on stage 1 of the 76th Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, with a 34.3km team time trial heading towards the coast set to decide the opening day.</p>\n<p>Starting in Orihuela, the race paid tribute to 1948 Vuelta a Espa√±a champion and post-war pioneer Bernardo Ruiz at the start line, to celebrate 100 years since his birth in the Spanish city.</p>\n<p>Making up more than 5% of the five-day race&#8217;s total 665.8km distance, it would be a vital day for the general classification contenders, with only three days of hilly racing and a sprint stage to make up any deficit.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck set the first benchmark or note at 41.26, knocking the Basque team out of the hot seats. The Belgian side&#8217;s focus in Valencia will be on versatile sprinter Kaden Groves.</p>\n<p>Not long after, however, Jayco AlUla came across the line with a time of 40:06, smashing Alpecin by 1:20 as the first team to average more than 50kph over the 34.3 kilometres. The Australian team crossed the line with GC leader O&#8217;Connor and three domestiques with him.</p>\n<p>Behind them, Lidl-Trek were beginning to look like the favourites, setting a best time at the day&#8217;s one intermediate time check with an average speed of 51.1.</p>\n<p>With a strong team of rouleurs looking to help sprinter Milan in Valencia, Lidl-Trek only got faster as their effort went on. With four ITT national champions among their seven-man roster in Vacek, Hoole, S√∂derqvist and Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier, the American team scorched to the line in a time of 39:19.</p>\n<p>As the only team to go under the 40-minute mark, Lidl-trek were unchallenged by the 15 teams who started after them, finishing the day with a 46-second lead over second place Jayco AlUla.</p>\n<p>GC teams UAE Emirates-XRG and Ineos Grenadiers both crossed the line more than 50 seconds down on Lidl-Trek&#8217;s rapid time. The Emirati team are led by Jo√£o Almeida and defending champion Brandon McNulty in Valencia, while the British team are racing for Carlos Rodr√≠guez and Thymen Arensman.</p>\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe were the last of the 22 teams to start on Wednesday and could have challenged Lidl-Trek with Aleksandr Vlasov and Jai Hindley on their seven-man roster for the week. However, they were well-matched with the other GC teams mentioned above, crossing the line one second faster than Ineos and less than a second slower than UAE.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=319&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is promoted by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) and is classified by the International Cycling Union (UCI) as a 2.1 category race.</p>\n<p>Tom Pidcock capped off a perfect first race for new team Q36.5, surviving a chaotic final day in the crosswinds to take his career-first elite stage race GC victory at the AlUla Tour.</p>\n<p>Stage 5 to the AlUla Camel Cup Track also saw the Brit&#8217;s teammate Matteo Moschetti outsprint Juan Sebasti√°n Molano (UAE Emirates-XRG) and Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco AlUla) to cap off a perfect five days of racing in Saudi Arabia for the Swiss team.</p>\n<p>Two phases of echelons forming in the peloton saw a big shake-up in the general classification, with pre-stage podium sitters Rainer Kepplinger (Bahrain &#8211; Victorious) and Alan Hatherly (Jayco AlUla) dropping to fifth and sixth, respectively, after missing the key split with 29km to go.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility made the difference in the crosswinds, splitting things up to drop Kepplinger and Hatherly so that their trio of Fredrik Dversnes, Johannes Kulset and √Ödne Holter moved up to second, third and fourth overall.</p>\n<p>Pidcock&#8217;s eventual winning margin of 1:09 over Dversnes is the biggest in the race&#8217;s history. </p>\n<p>&#8220;To be honest, I&#8217;m a bit emotional. It&#8217;s quite a fairy tale almost. To see how much it means to these guys is incredible, and to finish it off like that, it&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; said Pidcock.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, how we rode as a team. I didn&#8217;t know any of these guys until December, and some of them I only met in January, so what we already do together and how we do it is incredible actually.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pidcock had stage race success before joining the elite ranks, winning the Tour Alsace and Baby Giro, but the AlUla Tour was the first multi-day event on his pro palmar√®s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As an U23, I could do this, but it&#8217;s taken me a while as an elite. To be honest, it&#8217;s a big step in my career,&#8221; he said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The concentration it takes at this level to defend a lead every day, and this isn&#8217;t a WorldTour race; it&#8217;s only five days, I definitely realise how hard it is, but I think it&#8217;s a big step.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pidcock&#8217;s schedule will not see him head to the Ruta del Sol after some weeks of training before racing at Opening Weekend in Belgium and then the Italian Classics.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere were high speeds right from the off on the final stage of the AlUla Tour, with a furious fight for the breakaway ensuing once as the peloton rode away from the AlUla Camel Cup Track.</p>\n<p>Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Emirates-XRG) and Aivaras Mikutis (Tudor) found themselves in front, with a duo of Jan Castellon (Caja Rural &#8211; Seguros RGA) and Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB) in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Strong winds meant each change of direction was important, with full gas racing causing splits with over 100km to go. Pidcock kept himself towards the front in group one but there were early problems for Hatherly, who started the day in third place on GC and his sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, after missing the move.</p>\n<p>The peloton had under 30 riders in it at times, but a chance of direction back into headwin saw everything come back together with 80km to go.</p>\n<p>As things calmed momentarily, a new four-man breakaway formed of Desal, Diego Uriarte (Equipo Kern Pharma), Nicol√≤ Garibbo (JCL Team UKYO) and Mathias Bregnh√∏j (Terengganu), who built a gap of just over a minute.</p>\n<p>The status quo was maintained in the peloton until the 30km to go mark, where a key right-hand corner meant the peloton was going to be exiting the headwind section and turning back into a crosswind.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility led the peloton in pursuit of the overall podium and immediately split things. Quickly, it became evident that the Norwegian team&#8217;s plan was working, with second-place Kepplinger and third-place Hatherly both missing the front move.</p>\n<p>They worked desperately to try and bring things back and save their top-three finishes, but couldn&#8217;t make up the difference in the rapid run for home and ren-entry to the AlUla Camel Cup Track.</p>\n<p>The lead-out was ramped up by Q36.5, Jayco AlUla and then UAE Team Emirates-XRG, but it was Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility), who hit the front first. Molano overtook him for UAE and moved into the lead, but he didn&#8217;t have enough speed to hold off the charging Moschetti. </p>\n<p>Pidcock crossed the line safely after paying back his teammates and helping in the lead0out for the Italian, capping off a perfect race with a third stage victory for the Swiss team.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It&#8217;s quite a fairy tale almost. To see how much it means to these guys is incredible, and to finish it off like that, it&#8217;s unbelievable,&#8221; said Pidcock.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Today, how we rode as a team. I didn&#8217;t know any of these guys until December, and some of them I only met in January, so what we already do together and how we do it is incredible actually.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pidcock had stage race success before joining the elite ranks, winning the Tour Alsace and Baby Giro, but the AlUla Tour was the first multi-day event on his pro palmar√®s.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As an U23, I could do this, but it&#8217;s taken me a while as an elite. To be honest, it&#8217;s a big step in my career,&#8221; he said. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The concentration it takes at this level to defend a lead every day, and this isn&#8217;t a WorldTour race; it&#8217;s only five days, I definitely realise how hard it is, but I think it&#8217;s a big step.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pidcock&#8217;s schedule will not see him head to the Ruta del Sol after some weeks of training before racing at Opening Weekend in Belgium and then the Italian Classics.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere were high speeds right from the off on the final stage of the AlUla Tour, with a furious fight for the breakaway ensuing once as the peloton rode away from the AlUla Camel Cup Track.</p>\n<p>Mikkel Bjerg (UAE Emirates-XRG) and Aivaras Mikutis (Tudor) found themselves in front, with a duo of Jan Castellon (Caja Rural &#8211; Seguros RGA) and Ceriel Desal (Wagner Bazin WB) in pursuit.</p>\n<p>Strong winds meant each change of direction was important, with full gas racing causing splits with over 100km to go. Pidcock kept himself towards the front in group one but there were early problems for Hatherly, who started the day in third place on GC and his sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, after missing the move.</p>\n<p>The peloton had under 30 riders in it at times, but a chance of direction back into headwin saw everything come back together with 80km to go.</p>\n<p>As things calmed momentarily, a new four-man breakaway formed of Desal, Diego Uriarte (Equipo Kern Pharma), Nicol√≤ Garibbo (JCL Team UKYO) and Mathias Bregnh√∏j (Terengganu), who built a gap of just over a minute.</p>\n<p>The status quo was maintained in the peloton until the 30km to go mark, where a key right-hand corner meant the peloton was going to be exiting the headwind section and turning back into a crosswind.</p>\n<p>Uno-X Mobility led the peloton in pursuit of the overall podium and immediately split things. Quickly, it became evident that the Norwegian team&#8217;s plan was working, with second-place Kepplinger and third-place Hatherly both missing the front move.</p>\n<p>They worked desperately to try and bring things back and save their top-three finishes, but couldn&#8217;t make up the difference in the rapid run for home and ren-entry to the AlUla Camel Cup Track.</p>\n<p>The lead-out was ramped up by Q36.5, Jayco AlUla and then UAE Team Emirates-XRG, but it was Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility), who hit the front first. Molano overtook him for UAE and moved into the lead, but he didn&#8217;t have enough speed to hold off the charging Moschetti. </p>\n<p>Pidcock crossed the line safely after paying back his teammates and helping in the lead0out for the Italian, capping off a perfect race with a third stage victory for the Swiss team.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

So it was a long way.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m really happy, I extended the lead and it gives us a bit of a buffer going into tomorrow.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it Unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter a fast first half hour across flat, open desert roads, Alexandre Vinokourov (XDS Astana) repeated his stage 1 breakaway bid, taking with him Italian teammate Alessandro Romele and Belgium&#8217;s Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB), the intermediate sprints leader. There was one non-starter on the day: Nils Eekhoff (Picnic PostNL), who crashed and collided with a lamppost late on stage 3, breaking his jaw. </p>\n<p>The trio of early attackers were subsequently joined by a reinforcing move of Yuma Koishi (JCL Team UKYO), Muhammad Shamir Aiman Abdul Halim (Terengganu), Andreas Miltiadis and Kongphob Kimachai (both Roojai Insurance) as well as Reynders&#8217; French teammate Henri-Fran√ßois Renard-Haquin. The gap for the eight hovered at just over a minute as the race closed in on the last 50 kilometres and Q36.5 maintained the pace along with Jayco-AIUIa.</p>\n<p>Then as the road began to dip and swoop a little on the approach to the crunch climb of the day &#8211; and the race  &#8211; the break began to crack apart. By 20 kilometres to go, only Abdul Halim, Reynders, Romele, Koishi and Renard-Haquin remained ahead as the gradient very gradually, but remorselessly, steepened.</p>\n<p>A more sustained effort by UAE snuffed out the break completely just before the climb began in earnest. Then on the steepest section, Pidcock began a sustained effort that almost singlehandedly reduced the bunch to just 20 riders. Seemingly unaffected by the ramps pitching up to 20% and beyond, the Briton continued to shred the field, his steady drive squeezing the group on his wheel to just Rainer Kepplinger (Bahrain Victorious), Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AIUIa) and  Dunbar&#8217;s teammate Alan Hatherly.</p>\n<p>Then at nine kilometres from the line and a kilometre to the summit, Pidcock made a slightly more pronounced acceleration and there was no response as he bounded away on slopes that had eased slightly, but were still a daunting 14%. Such was the power of his attack that Dunbar was already swinging on the end of the tiny lead group, and finally, rather than counter-attack, Pidcock&#8217;s closest pursuers simply did what they could to try to limit the damage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of training that&#8217;s really helpful in these sorts of efforts,&#8221; Pidcock said later,  &#8220;this week I&#8217;ve set my new 5-10 minute best-ever power, so I&#8217;m definitely in good shape.&#8221;</p>\n<p>By the exposed summit, the chase group behind had gained a single reinforcement in the shape of 20-year-old Jonannes Kulset (Uno-X Mobility) and after a period of uncertain collaboration, with Dunbar briefly and fruitlessly trying to go for it alone, they settled for a well-organised group chase. </p>\n<p>Pidcock&#8217;s advantage did drop slightly on the slightly draggy roads, and with 1 kilometre to go, it had gone down notably. But despite the quartet&#8217;s dogged pursuit, the Briton&#8217;s initial advantage on the climb was more than enough to ensure he could stay away to the line, soloing across to his second win of 2025 with 12 seconds still in hand.</p>\n<p>Overall Pidcock now has a 29-second advantage on Kepplinger and a 32-second lead on Hatherly, so with just one fairly flat stage remaining,  the odds the 25-year-old will secure the AIUIa Tour outright on Saturday afternoon look high.  Yet even if the chances of making his already hugely successful start with new squad Q36.5 even better with the first-ever overall stage race win of his career, after stage 4, Pidcock remained cautious.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I actually looked at tomorrow&#8217;s stage already, which I probably shouldn&#8217;t have done, but it&#8217;s going to be pretty windy I think, it&#8217;ll be a pretty stressful day to hold this jersey,&#8221; Pidcock said. &#8220;So it&#8217;s definitely not over, but I couldn&#8217;t have done much more up til now.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is promoted by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) and is classified by the International Cycling Union (UCI) as a 2.1 category race.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) scored his second stage win in three days at the AlUla Tour, beating Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco-AlUla) in a two-man sprint battle on stage 3 at Tayma Fort. </p>\n<p>Juan Sebasti√°n Molano (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) rounded out the podium in a distant third place.</p>\n<p>The two sprinters were far ahead of the rest in the final of the 181km stage after Merlier launched the sprint early following a hectic run-in. Merlier was dropped on the front following a perfect lead-out from his Soudal-QuickStep train, including last man Bert Van Lerberghe.</p>\n<p>After rounding the final sweeping left-hand corner, Merlier and Groenewegen rounded Van Lerberghe to hit the front, immediately shooting towards the line with little competition from behind. The pair sprinted from a reduced peloton after the group had split to pieces in the desert crosswinds.</p>\n<p>The run to the line was marked by a nasty crash suffered by Nils Eekhoff (Picnic-PostNL), who touched the kerb and then collided hard with a lamppost as he tried to avoid other riders. Eekhoff was the only rider not to finish the stage and was taken to hospital by ambulance. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The big battle was OK. We were still with a big bunch after the echelons, so it was OK,&#8221; Merlier said after his win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The legs were really turning well today, and I was feeling well also. Just in the final it was a big hectic. The flash to the left was for the cars, not for us, so I thought at first, we took the wrong exit. In the end I was a bit surprised, but in the end, I won.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Race leader and stage 2 winner Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) was held up the final with a puncture coming just inside the 2km to go mark. He retains the green jersey overnight thanks to the 3km rule and leads Rainer Kepplinger (Bahrain Victorious) by eight seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing the big GC day on stage 2, where Pidcock scored his first win for his new Q36.5 team, the sprinters were back in action on Thursday on a flat day from Hegra to Tayma Fort. A downhill run into the finishing town would ensure a fast run-in, while the ride though the desert ran the risk of high winds and echelons.</p>\n<p>Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB) was in the breakaway once again, joined in the seven-man move by Hugo Aznar (Kern Pharma), Javier Iba√±ez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Roojai Insurance duo Andreas Miltiadis and Kane Richards, and JCL Team UKYO pair Masaki Yamamoto and Yuma Koishi.</p>\n<p>The group was given three minutes by the peloton, enough to keep them within reach ahead of the anticipated sprint finish, and a gap that was reduced by two-thirds by the 50km mark. The speed only went up from there as the wind whipped up, hitting 60-70kph at times as the breakaway was dragged back early.</p>\n<p>By the 35km mark, the break was over as the sprint squads ‚Äì including Jayco-AlUla, Soudal-QuickStep, and Tudor ‚Äì pulled the peloton along. At that point, the main group split apart as the race route changed direction and it was hit by the crosswinds.</p>\n<p>With enough firepower up front, it was a situation that would endure to the finish. Most of the big sprint and GC names were on the right side of the split, though the fourth man overall, Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla), was caught behind.</p>\n<p>The run to the finish saw a variety of teams working at the front in order to secure the front group&#8217;s advantage and set up the sprint. QuickStep and Jayco continued to work, while Picnic-PostNL and TotalEnergies were also involved.</p>\n<p>In the end, a messy run to Tayma Fort ended with the best sprinters on paper at the head of the race on the dash to the line. </p>\n<p>Groenewegen, fifth on the opening stage, found himself in a better position here, but once again it was Merlier&#8217;s day as the European champion powered home to a 52nd career victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is promoted by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) and is classified by the International Cycling Union (UCI) as a 2.1 category race.</p>\n<p>Tim Merlier (Soudal-QuickStep) scored his second stage win in three days at the AlUla Tour, beating Dylan Groenewegen (Jayco-AlUla) in a two-man sprint battle on stage 3 at Tayma Fort. </p>\n<p>Juan Sebasti√°n Molano (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) rounded out the podium in a distant third place.</p>\n<p>The two sprinters were far ahead of the rest in the final of the 181km stage after Merlier launched the sprint early following a hectic run-in. Merlier was dropped on the front following a perfect lead-out from his Soudal-QuickStep train, including last man Bert Van Lerberghe.</p>\n<p>After rounding the final sweeping left-hand corner, Merlier and Groenewegen rounded Van Lerberghe to hit the front, immediately shooting towards the line with little competition from behind. The pair sprinted from a reduced peloton after the group had split to pieces in the desert crosswinds.</p>\n<p>The run to the line was marked by a nasty crash suffered by Nils Eekhoff (Picnic-PostNL), who touched the kerb and then collided hard with a lamppost as he tried to avoid other riders. Eekhoff was the only rider not to finish the stage and was taken to hospital by ambulance. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The big battle was OK. We were still with a big bunch after the echelons, so it was OK,&#8221; Merlier said after his win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The legs were really turning well today, and I was feeling well also. Just in the final it was a big hectic. The flash to the left was for the cars, not for us, so I thought at first, we took the wrong exit. In the end I was a bit surprised, but in the end, I won.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Race leader and stage 2 winner Tom Pidcock (Q36.5) was held up the final with a puncture coming just inside the 2km to go mark. He retains the green jersey overnight thanks to the 3km rule and leads Rainer Kepplinger (Bahrain Victorious) by eight seconds.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nFollowing the big GC day on stage 2, where Pidcock scored his first win for his new Q36.5 team, the sprinters were back in action on Thursday on a flat day from Hegra to Tayma Fort. A downhill run into the finishing town would ensure a fast run-in, while the ride though the desert ran the risk of high winds and echelons.</p>\n<p>Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB) was in the breakaway once again, joined in the seven-man move by Hugo Aznar (Kern Pharma), Javier Iba√±ez (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA), Roojai Insurance duo Andreas Miltiadis and Kane Richards, and JCL Team UKYO pair Masaki Yamamoto and Yuma Koishi.</p>\n<p>The group was given three minutes by the peloton, enough to keep them within reach ahead of the anticipated sprint finish, and a gap that was reduced by two-thirds by the 50km mark. The speed only went up from there as the wind whipped up, hitting 60-70kph at times as the breakaway was dragged back early.</p>\n<p>By the 35km mark, the break was over as the sprint squads ‚Äì including Jayco-AlUla, Soudal-QuickStep, and Tudor ‚Äì pulled the peloton along. At that point, the main group split apart as the race route changed direction and it was hit by the crosswinds.</p>\n<p>With enough firepower up front, it was a situation that would endure to the finish. Most of the big sprint and GC names were on the right side of the split, though the fourth man overall, Eddie Dunbar (Jayco-AlUla), was caught behind.</p>\n<p>The run to the finish saw a variety of teams working at the front in order to secure the front group&#8217;s advantage and set up the sprint. QuickStep and Jayco continued to work, while Picnic-PostNL and TotalEnergies were also involved.</p>\n<p>In the end, a messy run to Tayma Fort ended with the best sprinters on paper at the head of the race on the dash to the line. </p>\n<p>Groenewegen, fifth on the opening stage, found himself in a better position here, but once again it was Merlier&#8217;s day as the European champion powered home to a 52nd career victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It&#8217;s a new team, all these great people, and I just wanted to do them proud today.

This year I&#8217;m on SRAM and the power meter is different. When you actually look objectively, I&#8217;m in a really, really good place, but of course after a winter when you haven&#8217;t competed against anyone and you&#8217;ve done a lot of efforts on your own, you actually don&#8217;t know. So, it&#8217;s nice to get a bit of assurance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The first time I thought I&#8217;d test the waters a little bit. Today we said we&#8217;d just try and win the stage. I felt the wind a little bit so I thought I was just going to wait a bit longer. We got to 500 to go and the road was going down to the left.

However the stage was cut by 30km at the 48km to go mark due to &#8220;surface issues&#8221; on the major descent of the finishing circuit, with the race also neutralised until five kilometres to race.</p>\n<p>As a result, the two-man break of Jens Reynders (Wagner Bazin WB) and Simone Raccani (JCL Team UKYO) ‚Äì who were a minute up the road ‚Äì were held back on the sand-strewn, gravelly, torn-up roads leading up to the descent. As the commissaire&#8217;s car took control of the pacemaking, a large peloton formed at the head of the race for the final kilometres.</p>\n<p>Having already tackled the closing climb once, the peloton rolled slowly down the descent, which seemed to feature a smoother surface than the climb. At the 10km to go mark, it was announced that racing would restart for the final 5km of the stage, including the final 3km ramp to the finish line.</p>\n<p>At the 6km mark, Reynders and Raccani were sent back up the road. The pair hit the final 5km with a 30-second lead reinstated, while behind them the pace rocketed as soon as the flag dropped for the race restart.</p>\n<p>Reynders and Raccani were brought back just 3km from the finish as Jayco-AlUla, Bahrain Victorious, and UAE Team Emirates-XRG led the charge at the front.

But despite a fine leadout effort from Q36.5 to help GC leader Tom Pidcock pick up bonus seconds, Uno-X and Wagner Bazin WB were able to get ahead and deny the Briton any bonuses.</p>\n<p>Picnic-PostNL pushed to the front to briefly remind the pack that they had last year&#8217;s stage  1 winner Casper van Uden in their 2025 AIUIa line-up but Soudal-QuickStep reasserted their dominance once again. </p>\n<p>A late crash, though, at the back of the bunch, brought down potential GC contender Rafal Majka (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), who finished more than six minutes down at the finish, as well as sprinters Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility) and Tudor&#8217;s Arvid de Kleijn. </p>\n<p>Following the late surge of speed in the pack and the crash, a front group of around 60 riders tore around the last left-hand bend and into the final 200 metres of the race, with Q36.5 Emils Liepin≈° still tussling for some kind of nominal control at the front of the pack. </p>\n<p>Merlier&#8217;s bright white jersey of European champion was visible just behind Lerberghe on the opposite side of the road, and a long, powerful drive for the line easily netted the Belgian sprinter the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

But the sprinters&#8217; squads like Soudal-Quick Step, Jayco-AIUIa and Picnic-PostNL jointly kept the pace high behind on the gently undulating desert roads. </p>\n<p>With 50 kilometres to go the gap was down to a scant 50 seconds, and the chasing peloton visibly slowed so as to ensure the break was not brought back too soon. </p>\n<p>A puncture for Merlier slowed down the process further but then the two Saudi Arabian National team riders both dropped back to the bunch as well. </p>\n<p>By the time the leaders swept into the finishing straight for the first of three visits, only Yamamoto and Rosli were ahead, picking up valuable bonus seconds prior to being caught almost immediately afterwards.</p>\n<p>Jayco-AIUIa moved to the front with Soudal-QuickStep for a ferocious drive round the second final lap of largely broad, flat boulevards. But despite a fine leadout effort from Q36.5 to help GC leader Tom Pidcock pick up bonus seconds, Uno-X and Wagner Bazin WB were able to get ahead and deny the Briton any bonuses.</p>\n<p>Picnic-PostNL pushed to the front to briefly remind the pack that they had last year&#8217;s stage  1 winner Casper van Uden in their 2025 AIUIa line-up but Soudal-QuickStep reasserted their dominance once again. </p>\n<p>A late crash, though, at the back of the bunch, brought down potential GC contender Rafal Majka (UAE Team Emirates-XRG), who finished more than six minutes down at the finish, as well as sprinters Alexander Kristoff (Uno-X Mobility) and Tudor&#8217;s Arvid de Kleijn. </p>\n<p>Following the late surge of speed in the pack and the crash, a front group of around 60 riders tore around the last left-hand bend and into the final 200 metres of the race, with Q36.5 Emils Liepin≈° still tussling for some kind of nominal control at the front of the pack. </p>\n<p>Merlier&#8217;s bright white jersey of European champion was visible just behind Lerberghe on the opposite side of the road, and a long, powerful drive for the line easily netted the Belgian sprinter the victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=868&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race, which was first held in 1999 and has been part of the WorldTour since 2008, starts in Prospect on January 21 and concludes in Adelaide on January 26 in 2025. The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>After coming so close last year, Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) timed his uphill sprint perfectly to win atop Willunga Hill on stage 5, securing the leader&#8217;s jersey and likely the overall victory of the Tour Down Under. </p>\n<p>Narv√°ez stayed calm after a flurry of attacks came from a split and decimated peloton the second time up the iconic climb including a solo flyer from the overnight leader Javier Romo (Movistar) on the lower slopes. Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) gave chase with Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) and Narv√°ez on his wheel as Romo pushed on, still having six seconds with one kilometre to go. </p>\n<p>The four men came together in the next 300 metres with Plapp at the front leading the group for the sprint. Narv√°ez jumped first with 200 metres to go, and easily held off Onley, the 2024 winner on Willunga. Finn Fisher-Black (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) caught the group near the finish line, taking third ahead of Plapp and Romo who were three seconds back. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúOf course, it [shows] how is the sport is, you need to keep trying, trying until you win the races,‚Äù said Narv√°ez. ‚ÄúIt was a hard day today, the temperature was high. It wasn‚Äôt easy. When you start, everyone tell you, you are the favourite, it‚Äôs not easy for me, but in the end, we made it.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Narv√°ez ‚Äì with the gap on the stage and 10 seconds time bonus for the win ‚Äì turned his four second deficit on the overall into a nine second advantage on Romo.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI tried. I know that my sprint is not so good, but I tried to attack when the second group was behind, because I thought it&#8217;s possible that Narv√°ez is not in a good position. I tried ‚Äì it&#8217;s possible that it was too early. I lost the GC, but I&#8217;m very happy with second,‚Äù Romo told Cyclingnews.</p>\n<p>Barring catastrophe on Sunday‚Äôs final stage, Narv√°ez, the 2024 runner-up, will now be the overall winner of the 25th edition of the stage race as this year the Tour Down ends with a relatively flat, fast 90km stage 6 in Adelaide.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe suspense was high as riders lined up in McLaren Vale for the penultimate stage of the men‚Äôs Tour Down Under. This was the last gasp for the overall contenders and also contained the summit finish every budding Australian cyclist wants to win, a task getting ever more difficult to achieve every year as the list of in-form international riders lining up grows.</p>\n<p>Before the riders could battle it out on the final finish line of Willunga after 145.7km of racing there were plenty of other challenges to deal with. They included an early break of six that included Pablo Torres (UAE Team Emirates -XRG) who was only 35 seconds back on the overall and then there was no small matter of Wickham Hill, a 3km ascent with an average gradient of 6.9%.</p>\n<p>The breakaway group along with Torres, included Oliver Bleddyn (ARA Australia), Michael Hepburn (Jayco-AlUla), Pascal Eenkhoorn (Soudal-Quickstep), Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) and Juan Lopez (Lidl-Trek). Lopez secured the top points on the KOM, with Torres behind, but the group wasn&#8217;t happy to have the GC danger on board. They ultimately dispatched Torres and also Lopez, though the Lidl-Trek rider battled on to try and rejoin.</p>\n<p>By the time the lead group of four had passed over the top of Willunga ‚Äì which they would first descend before sweeping back at the end of the day to climb it twice ‚Äì the gap had stretched significantly. Swift, Eenkhoorn, Hepburn and Bleddyn were on the flat in the township at the base of Willunga Hill well before the peloton began the descent, and they continued to stretch the gap.</p>\n<p>The descent wasn‚Äôt without its drama ‚Äì although much more was still to unfold on Willunga Hill later in the day ‚Äì as Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla), stage 1 and 2 winner Sam Welsford (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Loe van Belle (Visma-Lease a Bike) fell. Luke Durbridge (Jayco-AlUla) was quickly on hand to pace Harper back to the group, the climber the team‚Äôs top rider on GC at the start of the day.</p>\n<p>Into the flatter sections of the race, the lead group had stretched the gap out to 4:20 by the time it was 95km to go. Not able to make the catch, Lopez sat up with 89km to go, taking in the ocean views on the 30¬∞C day and refuelling before being absorbed back into the peloton.</p>\n<p>Round past the sparkling blue waters and Aldinga for a second time, and with 48km to go, the gap was at 2:44, the heat not yet completely on in the field but with the temperature rising as teams started to anticipate the climbs of Willunga Hill ‚Äì a 3km ascent with an average gradient of 7.4% and a maximum of 11%.</p>\n<p>At 26km to go, the gap was just 49 seconds and it was also only three up the front now as Hepburn had decided it was time for him to sit up and turn his attention to the team goals. </p>\n<p>As the race hit the base of the climb for the first time, Bleddyn tried to ride away from his remaining break companions but with little more than 1km to go to the top of the initial ascent, they were swept up. The teams were attempting to fire early volleys, with Jayco-AlUla getting two riders off the front, Harper and Mauro Schmid going over the top of the iconic climb ten seconds in front of the stretched-out, but still well-populated, group behind.</p>\n<p>There were splits aplenty on the aggressive final run into the climb. With Schmid and Harper having been swept up before-hand, and with news that Narv√°ez was on the wrong side of one it didn‚Äôt take long for the big move to come, and it was from none other than the ochre jersey clad, Javier Romo (Movistar). He seemed to be living by the ethos that the best form of defence was attack as he went at the very base of the 3km ascent.</p>\n<p>The pursuit, however, was on, Plapp was among those leading the chase at around 2km to go, though he had passengers. They pulled Romo back into the fold but with a fierce turn of speed and at just four seconds back on GC, Narv√°ez had peeled back any gap and was now looking like the most dangerous rider in the small group heading to the line. Last year&#8217;s race runner-up played his hand to perfection and now, as a result, looks set to ride away from Australia with ochre on his back.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) held off a late charge by Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain Victorious) and Jhonathan Narvaez (UAE Team Emirates XRG) in a chaotic sprint to win stage 4 of the Tour Down Under in Victor Harbor. </p>\n<p>The French fastman timed his sprint perfectly, using Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) to slingshot his way to the front with 300 metres to go in the mad dash for the line. Bauhaus tried to come at him but it was too late and had to settle for second place. Narvaez waved his arms in frustration and took third.</p>\n<p>Coquard didn‚Äôt let an early crash, where his teammate Alexis Renard emerged bloodied, deny his victorious sprint after he stayed in the front group that split on the category 2 Nettle Hill, cresting inside of 20 kilometres to go before a fast descent to the finish line. </p>\n<p>Israel-Premier Tech team led the chase to catch the last remaining breakaway rider Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) was caught leading to a flurry of attacks at the front of the 72-rider group, some of these attacks covered by race leader himself Javier Romo (Movistar). Five Ineos Grenadiers riders attempted to control the bunch with one kilometre to go but they were swamped in the finale.</p>\n<p>Race leader Javier Romo (Movistar) finished safely in the group and retained the lead in the general classification.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúVery lucky to win today, because yesterday is not a good day for the team, we didn&#8217;t have good legs, And the general classification is [gone], we lose a chance yesterday, but today, I know it&#8217;s my best chance to win here. And, yeah, it&#8217;s a perfect day,‚Äù Coquard said.</p>\n<p>Back in 2023, the 32-year-old claimed his first WorldTour victory at the Tour Down Under.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI love this country. Maybe in the start of season, every every year, I‚Äôm good, and I start good, and with the results, yeah, I love this country. It&#8217;s perfect for me to start. And it&#8217;s a good start for the team.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the eve of the Queen Stage, Romo has four seconds on Narvaez and 10 seconds on Patrick Konrad (Lidl-Trek) and Finn Fisher-Black (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe). A total of 28 riders, including Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers), Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates XRG), Chris Harper and Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) and defending champion Stephen Williams (Israel-PremierTech), are under one minute.</p>\n<p>Stage 5 will feature two ascents of the iconic Willunga Hill in the last 25km, for the final GC showdown on Saturday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI&#8217;m very happy, the objective today was to maintain the jersey. My team did super good job leading the leading the race , it‚Äôs not normal to see Movistar leading the race to maintain the job they did and let&#8217;s see tomorrow in Willunga,‚Äù Romo said.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nMart√≠n L√≥pez (XDS Astana) was the fourth non-starter, dropping out after a crash on stage 3 of the Tour Down Under. He reportedly was hit by a tree branch and fell face-first to the ground. He has a mild concussion and had to get some stitches, but is otherwise OK according to the team.</p>\n<p>The fight for the breakaway was more hectic at the start of the 157.2km stage 4 from Glenelg to Victor Harbor, with an attack coming first from notable attackers Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Ide Schelling (XDS Astana). Initially, there was no reaction from the bunch, but a counter-attack from Giosue Epis (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) sparked interest from Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) and Junior Lecerf (Soudal-Quickstep), both of whom closed the sub-30 second gap to the three attackers, eventually making a five-man move.</p>\n<p>A crash in the peloton took down Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates) and also involved Cofidis&#8217; Bryan Coquard and Alexis Renard. All riders were quickly back up and riding but the chaos allowed the lead quintet to open a minute&#8217;s gap.</p>\n<p>The peloton kept the breakaway on a short leash, they weren&#8217;t given much more than a two-minute advantage. Schmid, starting the day at 31 seconds and Lecerf at 35 were the main animators for the bonus sprints. The Swiss champion bested the Belgian in both to chip away at his GC deficit.</p>\n<p>Just 50km into the stage, after an uncategorised climb, the gap to the peloton was down just below a minute and the team cars between the break and bunch were sent back, suggesting there might be an early catch ahead of the intermediate sprint at kilometre 71.5.</p>\n<p>However, the peloton sat up and let the gap go back out a bit, allowing the breakaway to contest the sprint. After taking the bonus seconds, Schmid was up to 19th place overall at 25 seconds while Lecerf climbed from 28th to 21st.</p>\n<p>His job done, Lecerf sat up and went back to the peloton, leaving the four others to try to hold off the chase. The gap went back out over two minutes as the bunch bided their time to shut them down, not wanting the catch to come and spark any further attacks.</p>\n<p>Their lead went out to 2:31 with 52km to go but with Epis skipping pulls and teams like Jayco-AlUla, EF Education-EasyPost and Israel-Premier Tech coming forward to take over from Movistar in the bunch, the time gap began to fall rapidly.</p>\n<p>As the final climb approached, the gap to the breakaway fell under one minute as the battle for position in the peloton heated up. It had swung back out over the 60-second mark with 26km to go and Natnael Tesfazion attacked briefly, perhaps to try and reignite the chase, but it didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p>By the time they hit the Nettle Hill ascent with 23km to go, the four leaders still had 1:15. As the gradients began to bite, Epis was dropped as Schmid surged clear with Schelling and Van der Hoorn further down the road.</p>\n<p>Just behind, UAE Team Emirates surged to halve the leader&#8217;s advantage, catching Epis before the summit and Van der Hoorn and Schelling soon after. Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech) strung out the chasing group over the top in pursuit and points leader Sam Welsford (Bora-Hansgrohe) bore the brunt of the pain, ending up in a chasing group.</p>\n<p>Schmid was finally caught by Van der Hoorn, who led the peloton past with 13.2km to go.</p>\n<p>Pablo Torres (UAE Team Emirates) was the next attacker, popping up the road on an unclassified rise with 11.5km remaining. Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R) quickly bridged across, but the peloton were moving too quickly and their move lasted for less than a kilometre.</p>\n<p>Next to go was Sven Erik Bystr√∏m (Groupama-FDJ), marked by Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), and then Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) went on the attack. Bystr√∏m again was keen to go with.</p>\n<p>The GC danger heated up when Patrick Konrad (Lidl-Trek) attacked, forcing Romo to react, and with the pair ahead holding a slender lead, Soler used his engine to close them down with 7.5km to go.</p>\n<p>No team managed to control the front of the peloton but Ineos Grenadiers tried their hand at it, putting five riders in the mix with one kilometre to go but were swamped 600 metres later by the charging group accelerating towards the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race, which was first held in 1999 and has been part of the WorldTour since 2008, starts in Prospect on January 21 and concludes in Adelaide on January 26 in 2025. The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) held off a late charge by Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain Victorious) and Jhonathan Narvaez (UAE Team Emirates XRG) in a chaotic sprint to win stage 4 of the Tour Down Under in Victor Harbor. </p>\n<p>The French fastman timed his sprint perfectly, using Laurence Pithie (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) to slingshot his way to the front with 300 metres to go in the mad dash for the line. Bauhaus tried to come at him but it was too late and had to settle for second place. Narvaez waved his arms in frustration and took third.</p>\n<p>Coquard didn‚Äôt let an early crash, where his teammate Alexis Renard emerged bloodied, deny his victorious sprint after he stayed in the front group that split on the category 2 Nettle Hill, cresting inside of 20 kilometres to go before a fast descent to the finish line. </p>\n<p>Israel-Premier Tech team led the chase to catch the last remaining breakaway rider Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) was caught leading to a flurry of attacks at the front of the 72-rider group, some of these attacks covered by race leader himself Javier Romo (Movistar). Five Ineos Grenadiers riders attempted to control the bunch with one kilometre to go but they were swamped in the finale.</p>\n<p>Race leader Javier Romo (Movistar) finished safely in the group and retained the lead in the general classification.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúVery lucky to win today, because yesterday is not a good day for the team, we didn&#8217;t have good legs, And the general classification is [gone], we lose a chance yesterday, but today, I know it&#8217;s my best chance to win here. And, yeah, it&#8217;s a perfect day,‚Äù Coquard said.</p>\n<p>Back in 2023, the 32-year-old claimed his first WorldTour victory at the Tour Down Under.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI love this country. Maybe in the start of season, every every year, I‚Äôm good, and I start good, and with the results, yeah, I love this country. It&#8217;s perfect for me to start. And it&#8217;s a good start for the team.‚Äù</p>\n<p>On the eve of the Queen Stage, Romo has four seconds on Narvaez and 10 seconds on Patrick Konrad (Lidl-Trek) and Finn Fisher-Black (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe). A total of 28 riders, including Magnus Sheffield (Ineos Grenadiers), Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates XRG), Chris Harper and Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla), Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) and defending champion Stephen Williams (Israel-PremierTech), are under one minute.</p>\n<p>Stage 5 will feature two ascents of the iconic Willunga Hill in the last 25km, for the final GC showdown on Saturday.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI&#8217;m very happy, the objective today was to maintain the jersey. My team did super good job leading the leading the race , it‚Äôs not normal to see Movistar leading the race to maintain the job they did and let&#8217;s see tomorrow in Willunga,‚Äù Romo said.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nMart√≠n L√≥pez (XDS Astana) was the fourth non-starter, dropping out after a crash on stage 3 of the Tour Down Under. He reportedly was hit by a tree branch and fell face-first to the ground. He has a mild concussion and had to get some stitches, but is otherwise OK according to the team.</p>\n<p>The fight for the breakaway was more hectic at the start of the 157.2km stage 4 from Glenelg to Victor Harbor, with an attack coming first from notable attackers Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Ide Schelling (XDS Astana). Initially, there was no reaction from the bunch, but a counter-attack from Giosue Epis (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) sparked interest from Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) and Junior Lecerf (Soudal-Quickstep), both of whom closed the sub-30 second gap to the three attackers, eventually making a five-man move.</p>\n<p>A crash in the peloton took down Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates) and also involved Cofidis&#8217; Bryan Coquard and Alexis Renard. All riders were quickly back up and riding but the chaos allowed the lead quintet to open a minute&#8217;s gap.</p>\n<p>The peloton kept the breakaway on a short leash, they weren&#8217;t given much more than a two-minute advantage. Schmid, starting the day at 31 seconds and Lecerf at 35 were the main animators for the bonus sprints. The Swiss champion bested the Belgian in both to chip away at his GC deficit.</p>\n<p>Just 50km into the stage, after an uncategorised climb, the gap to the peloton was down just below a minute and the team cars between the break and bunch were sent back, suggesting there might be an early catch ahead of the intermediate sprint at kilometre 71.5.</p>\n<p>However, the peloton sat up and let the gap go back out a bit, allowing the breakaway to contest the sprint. After taking the bonus seconds, Schmid was up to 19th place overall at 25 seconds while Lecerf climbed from 28th to 21st.</p>\n<p>His job done, Lecerf sat up and went back to the peloton, leaving the four others to try to hold off the chase. The gap went back out over two minutes as the bunch bided their time to shut them down, not wanting the catch to come and spark any further attacks.</p>\n<p>Their lead went out to 2:31 with 52km to go but with Epis skipping pulls and teams like Jayco-AlUla, EF Education-EasyPost and Israel-Premier Tech coming forward to take over from Movistar in the bunch, the time gap began to fall rapidly.</p>\n<p>As the final climb approached, the gap to the breakaway fell under one minute as the battle for position in the peloton heated up. It had swung back out over the 60-second mark with 26km to go and Natnael Tesfazion attacked briefly, perhaps to try and reignite the chase, but it didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p>By the time they hit the Nettle Hill ascent with 23km to go, the four leaders still had 1:15. As the gradients began to bite, Epis was dropped as Schmid surged clear with Schelling and Van der Hoorn further down the road.</p>\n<p>Just behind, UAE Team Emirates surged to halve the leader&#8217;s advantage, catching Epis before the summit and Van der Hoorn and Schelling soon after. Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech) strung out the chasing group over the top in pursuit and points leader Sam Welsford (Bora-Hansgrohe) bore the brunt of the pain, ending up in a chasing group.</p>\n<p>Schmid was finally caught by Van der Hoorn, who led the peloton past with 13.2km to go.</p>\n<p>Pablo Torres (UAE Team Emirates) was the next attacker, popping up the road on an unclassified rise with 11.5km remaining. Andrea Vendrame (Decathlon AG2R) quickly bridged across, but the peloton were moving too quickly and their move lasted for less than a kilometre.</p>\n<p>Next to go was Sven Erik Bystr√∏m (Groupama-FDJ), marked by Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), and then Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) went on the attack. Bystr√∏m again was keen to go with.</p>\n<p>The GC danger heated up when Patrick Konrad (Lidl-Trek) attacked, forcing Romo to react, and with the pair ahead holding a slender lead, Soler used his engine to close them down with 7.5km to go.</p>\n<p>No team managed to control the front of the peloton but Ineos Grenadiers tried their hand at it, putting five riders in the mix with one kilometre to go but were swamped 600 metres later by the charging group accelerating towards the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

He held off his rivals to cross the line with a five-second lead and enough time to celebrate his victory.</p>\n<p>Romo stayed in the reduced peloton, letting the other teams cover moves the second time up Knotts Hill, and then countered with a massive acceleration after they crested inside of six kilometres to go.  A moment of hesitation by the 20-rider group was enough for the Spanish rider to get a gap as he flew down to the finish line. </p>\n<p>Behind, first Chris Harper (Jayco-AlUla) and Oscar Onley (Picnic PostNL) each tried to catch Romo solo but their respective moves were shut down as the small group sped to the finish line. With five riders still in the group, all eyes were on the Lidl-Trek team to chase Romo down but the group could not get organized and switched their focus on the upcoming sprint for second and third, and those all-important bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) led out the sprint but was swamped in the field sprint. Jhonathan Narvaez (UAE Team Emirates XRG) secured second by a bike throw ahead of Finn Fisher-Black (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) who was third. Albert Withen Philipsen (Lidl-Trek) took fourth.</p>\n<p>This victory, the first UCI win in his career, is &#8220;so important&#8221; for Romo who trained with this race in mind this winter.</p>\n<p>&#8220;From this winter, I worked a lot thinking about Tour Down Under and I can imagine this day. I&#8217;m so happy, I want to say thank you to my team because today, their work is very good for me. They have a lot of confidence in me, and this victory is so important &#8211; also for my family, my girlfriend and all the people who helped me this year,&#8221; the 26-year old said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Until after the last kilometre, I knew that the victory was mine.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Fisher-Black was solo in the front group and was hoping other teams with bigger numbers would lead the chase to bring Romo back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I went to the back of the group, just after these rollers, and I saw five Trek guys and those two guys up the road. I wasn&#8217;t sure what the tactics were there. I was hoping they had pulled them back on this downhill into the finish, but in the end, I think it was Jayco chasing him back. So yeah, maybe controversial tactics there. But it is what it is,&#8221; Fisher-Black said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, we had to sprint for a second. And I think I was third on the line &#8211; I&#8217;m happy with that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Defending champion Stevie Williams (Israel-PremierTech) crashed in the feed zone with 61 kilometres to go and lost touch in the final climb, finishing 25 seconds behind the stage winner. The team confirmed that he had sustained some contusions but no majo injuries.</p>\n<p>Romo takes over the ochre leader&#8217;s jersey with eight seconds on Narvaez. Patrick Konrad (Lidl-Trek) is third, and Fisher-Black fourth, both tied at 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>In seventh place overall, Philipsen is 15 seconds down and takes the lead in the best young rider classification.</p>\n<p>Fergus Browning (ARA Australia) once again nabbed KOM points while in the break to increase his ever growing lead in the mountains classification. Overnight race leader and double stage winner Sam Welsford (Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe) leads the points classification.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 147.5km stage to Uraidla was most certainly a day for the climbers &#8211; and even more certainly not for race leader Sam Welsford (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe). The first breakaway was formed when sprint lead-out man Dries De Pooter (Intermarch√©-Wanty) launched from the first kilometre. He was soon joined by fast man Ben Swift (Ineos Grenadiers), mountains classification leader Fergus Browning (ARA Australian National Team) and Geoffey Bouchard (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>However, the first climb also started not long after the flag drop, and a counter-attack led by Ide Schelling (XDS Astana) created a surge in pace, and the quartet were soon caught.</p>\n<p>Before the summit, Swift&#8217;s cousin and teammate Connor Swift launched a move and Browning, keen to take more points toward his polka dot jersey, latched on and the peloton were then satisfied that the breakaway would not threaten the GC men.</p>\n<p>Browning swept up the maximum points on Norton Summit as the pair had 1:30 on the bunch. Then, with the road still tilting upwards after the KOM, Swift sat up and left Browning off the front alone wondering if he should push on or sit up. He kept riding tempo and pulled out a gap of more than two minutes.</p>\n<p>After 27km of racing, Bouchard attacked from the peloton and attempted to bridge across to Browning, and made it well before the intermediate sprint at kilometre 39.1.</p>\n<p>With a kilometre to go before the sprint, Simon Clarke (Israel-Premier Tech) attacked from the peloton to successfully steal the final bonus seconds just in case any of the rivals of his team leader Williams tried to snatch one.</p>\n<p>Browning and Bouchard collaborated to pull out a lead of 3:33 with 75km to go. Without a little effort from Jayco-AlUla&#8217;s Luke Durbridge, the peloton carved a minute off that gap over the next five kilometres.</p>\n<p>The gap was down below two minutes when defending champion Stevie Williams (Israel-Premier Tech) was caught up in a crash in the feed zone with 61km to go. But a quick scramble from the team brought the Briton back into the fold a few kilometres later.</p>\n<p>Williams didn&#8217;t have time to recover, because UAE Team Emirates and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe started drilling the pace at the front with 53km to go to get their leaders in a safe position for the technical descent leading into the first climb of Knotts Hill.</p>\n<p>Browning further extended his lead in the mountains classification as the pair&#8217;s advantage was still touching a minute as the young Australian claimed the maximum points. But his compatriots on the Jayco-AlUla team were on the chase behind, slowly clawing back the gap.</p>\n<p>Bouchard claimed the three bonus seconds ahead of Browning at the intermediate sprint with 35.2km to go, and half a minute behind a full on sprint from Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe led Finn Fisher-Black to the final bonus second.</p>\n<p>Attacks flew after the sprint, with Juan Pedro Lopez (Lidl-Trek) attacking twice but was each time marked by Groupama-FDJ&#8217;s Lewis Askey. The peloton didn&#8217;t let anyone go, but the pace was enough for the pair to be in sight with 27.4 to go. Browning sat up, but Bouchard continued on for another 2km.</p>\n<p>There was a lull in the action until the long, gradual uncategorised climb leading into the last ascent of Knotts Hill, where another surge for positioning sparked a crash mid-peloton with 14.5km to go. Mart√≠n Lopez (XDS Astana) was the worst off, his team confirming that he had to abandon the race and was taken to hospital for medical checks.</p>\n<p>Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) won the battle for the lead of the bunch on the fast descent heading into Knotts Hill, but Ineos Grenadiers assumed control of the reduced peloton before the climb.</p>\n<p>Micha≈Ç Kwiatkowski made his move with 7.4km to go and 1.8 to the summit, and he was closely marked by Groupama-FDJ&#8217;s Remy Rochas, but Jayco-AlUla shut that down. Afonso Eulalio (Bahrain Victorious) was the next to go 600 metres later.</p>\n<p>The attacks severely reduced the size of the leading group but a counterattack from Jay Vine inspired Rochas to put in another dangerous dig that shot defending champ Williams out the back.</p>\n<p>Javier Romo (Movistar) was the next rider to go after Rochas was reeled in after the summit. Another surge came from Ineos then an attack from Jayco-AlUla&#8217;s Chris Harper. When Harper was caught, Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNl) went clear, but still Romo powered on.</p>\n<p>Jayco-AlUla led the charge to reel Onley back with less that 1000 metres to go and prepared for the reduced field sprint.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race, which was first held in 1999 and has been part of the WorldTour since 2008, starts in Prospect on January 21 and concludes in Adelaide on January 26 in 2025. The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>A battered and bruised Sam Welsford (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) received a perfect leadout from his Red Bull-BORA-hansgrohe teammates to take his second win in so many days at the 2025 Tour Down Under.</p>\n<p>Arne Marit (Intermarch√©-Wanty) took second and Bryan Coquard (Cofidis) was third in the fast and hectic stage 2 finale.</p>\n<p>After crashing within the first five kilometers of the stage, Welsford continued on despite his ripped shorts. His team controlled the early breakaway and later rallied around him when he faced challenges on the third ascent of Menglers Hill, losing contact with the peloton with 25 kilometres remaining. Thanks to his teammates&#8217; support and after going deep, Welsford rejoined the group roughly 10 kilometres later.</p>\n<p>The Australian then stayed on Danny van Poppel‚Äôs wheel, as he moved him up to the front as others behind battled to get his wheel. Welsford launched his sprint with less than 100 meters to go,  and held on to the line.  Van Poppel pulled off, first going left to the centre of the road to let Welsford go to his right and then moving right to close the door on Tobias Lund Andresen (Picnic PostNL), who in reaction had to go further left, forcing Phil Bauhaus (Bahrain-Victorious) to hit the brakes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Bloody hell &#8211; it was bike off in the first 5k to the race, and that was less than ideal. It was a pretty hard day out there. The break of three came back quite early, and then everyone started getting quite nervous, then last time up the climb I was on my limit,‚Äù Welsford said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think it&#8217;s always hard to win again &#8211; everyone looks at you even more. The parcours didn&#8217;t suit us as well as yesterday, but we made it our race.

He pulled me back on after the climb, and then still managed to do that 20-second lead out at God knows what power. That was amazing. I&#8217;m just happy to finish it off for him, and Laurence [Pithie] &#8211; Ben [Zwiehoff], Ryan [Mullen] &#8211; all the guys came back on the climb and tried to help me get back on.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Marit, who was taken out of contention for stage 1 sprint due to a puncture, was also dropped on Menglers Hill and finally rejoined the pack with 10 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI came back, but I gambled so much. It was full gas, but actually I still had some legs, so I didn&#8217;t do any pulls in the back. In the end, I found my teammates. I was actually not quite sure about my legs, but as a sprinter, you can always do something more when you see the line,‚Äù Marit said.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI knew the wind was coming from the left, so the space was left, and Dries [De Pooter] actually brought me perfect position. He was not doubting anything about me. So I really have to thank the team. And this second place gives a lot of confidence, really.</p>\n<p>Van Poppel, who originally crossed the line in tenth place, was relegated to 118th, the last position in the group he finished with.</p>\n<p>Welsford retained the ochre leader‚Äôs jersey with Marit in second place and Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) in third. Both are tied at 14 seconds back.</p>\n<p>Welsford also leads the point classification. Fergus Browing (ARA Australia) nabbed more KOM points after another day in the break, and has a solid 26-point lead in the mountains classification. Brennan retained the best young rider jersey. </p>\n<p>After two days for the sprinters, it will be time for the climbers and overall contenders to shine on stage 3 which will change the GC dramatically. The 147.5km route from Norwood to Uraidla features Norton Summit and a new climb, Knott&#8217;s Hill, with its punishing 22.2% grade, which the racers will tackle twice. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 128.8km Tanunda stage provided even more relief from the heat that had hit the women‚Äôs race, with the forecast for the town in the heart of the Barossa wine region 29¬∞C, though with blue skies and a blazing sun, the ice stockings were still in the back of the jerseys.</p>\n<p>The flag dropped and Fergus Browning (ARA Australian Cycling Team) was off and away, he‚Äôd experienced what it felt like to line up in the KOM jersey and wanted to do it again.

The 2.7km climb with an average gradient of 6.9%, peaking at 12.2%, would feature three times on the course today, which looped around Tanunda providing an obstacle for the sprinters, particularly on its final appearance at 22km to the finish.</p>\n<p>The gap, shrinking to about one-and-a-half minutes, by the intermediate sprint at 97.6km to go, and the riders out the front had every incentive to take what they could while they could,  Konrad topping Zimmerman on the line.</p>\n<p>The riders out front, however, kept and even extended their gap a little as they passed the Tanunda start/finish the first time and then headed toward Menglers Hill again, with the peloton easing off and the gap heading toward two-and-a-half minutes as Browning once again claimed top points.</p>\n<p>The sprinters&#8217; teams, however, were intensifying the chase, Visma-Lease a Bike sending a rider to the front to help Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe keep pressure on the gap. The break of Browning, Konrad and Zimmermann succumbed at around 45km to go, so the field was altogether as it passed the landmark stretch of palms lining the road alongside Seppeltsfield Wines and worked its way, with care in the wind-prone sections, to the start/finish line for the penultimate pass.</p>\n<p>The field was stretched with Connor Swift (Ineos Grenadiers) applying the pressure as the field hit the base of the climb of Menglers Hill for the last time. An attack from Juan Pedro L√≥pez (Lidl-Trek) spurred some action but it was short-lived, likely much to the relief of the sprinters.</p>\n<p>Still, Welsford could be seen hanging off the back of the field ‚Äì the ochre-clad sprinter had some serious work to do and energy to be spent in the pursuit. The pressure remained on at the front, with the jabs continuing, though Welsford‚Äôs teammates helped haul him back into the fray at around 15km to go.</p>\n<p>The field remained stretched, though then settled at around 8km to go, the peloton bunching up and allowing the sprinters to get ready for the dash ahead.  The shuffling and re-shuffling of the peloton continued for the next kilometres as they sped around road furniture while Welsford was moved up to the front with 2.5 kilometres to go.

The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>Sam Welsford of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe claimed victory on stage 1 of the Tour Down Under after launching his sprint early and holding off his rivals in a chaotic finale. As Welsford was celebrating just before crossing the line, Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) who was flying up, ran out of road and had to settle for second place. </p>\n<p>Matthew Walls (Groupama-FDJ) was third.</p>\n<p>Having won three stages last year, and the Down Under Classic days ago, Sam Welsford was a marked rider and the peloton looked to his team to control the pace. His teammates Filip Maciejuk and Ben Zwiehoff kept the breakaway within a manageable five-minute gap before two other teams joined the effort midway through the stage, finally reeling in the two escapees with 23 kilometres remaining.</p>\n<p>Once the pair was reeled in, Welsford slotted behind his leadout man Danny van Poppel in the peloton while the teams jostled for position at the front, before jumping with 250 metres to go. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúBloody hell. I get sick and tired of going early now that&#8217;s enough,‚Äù Welsford said a laugh. ‚ÄúSuper hard run in, I probably stepped off Danny a little bit too early. Actually,  I think he had a lot more to give, and he did such a big good job, and he was on the front for so long.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat last straight was super hard to control the front. It was pretty hard, and they were getting dive-bombed every corner, so we had to kind of come back a bit and wait. We ran out of guys, but boys did an amazing job today. And we took it on, we were the only team riding all day until the end, and then so happy to pay them back for the win.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Welsford admits that he was surprised by Brennan coming up on his left side.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI checked when I went and I was like, oh, this is long. And I could see someone underneath me, under my shoulder,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd then my legs were burning, like maybe 15 meters ago, and now I saw him kind of distance off, so I checked right, and then realized I had him. But then he came on the left when I saluted, and I was like, oh no, don&#8217;t tell me, but I think I had enough room, but I was just so cooked I couldn&#8217;t even get the other arm up.‚Äù</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coming second is really nice, and got to say big thanks to the team,&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;Just in the final few Ks, just, just trying to figure it out. And managed to find that little slot on the side of the side of the road, and went for it. &#8221;</p>\n<p>Welsford claims the first ochre leader‚Äôs jersey of the 2025 Tour Down Under. He leads the general classification with four seconds on Brennan. Zac Marriage (ARA Australia) who spent the majority of the stage in the break, sits in third place, five seconds down by virtue of the time bonus seconds taken in the intermediate sprints.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 should deliver another chance for the sprinters on the 128.8km route starting and ending in Tanuda. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe long line of team cars lined up at the start in Prospect, not far north of Adelaide, as the riders got set for the first of six days of racing that would take them through Adelaide and the surrounding hills and vineyards of South Australia. The 150.7km stage to Gumeracha, the home in the hills of the giant rocking horse, was always slated as one for the sprinters but it certainly wasn‚Äôt a flat journey, with 2,386m of elevation gain through the sunny stage with temperatures in the low 30‚Äôs.</p>\n<p>It was an early launch for the break, with the flurry of attacks ultimately resulting in a three man group as Bastien Tronchon (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) was joined by two riders from the ARA Australian Cycling Team, Fergus Browning and Zac Marriage. Browning took top points at the first KOM at just 11.2km in the race and then the group worked together on the undulating tree-lined roads to stretch the gap to around five minutes with 130km to go.</p>\n<p>At the sprint in Williamstown, with 109.7km still ahead, Tronchon took the points and then soon decided it was time to sit up. The two Australians however, weren‚Äôt going to let their moment out the front of the WorldTour race end so soon.</p>\n<p>Browning, who won the U23 men‚Äôs Australian road race championships last year, had been making a mark in Europe with Trinity last season though the rider who won stage 1 of the Tour de l‚ÄôAin was left adrift by the closure of its road squad, so is on the lookout for a way back. Marriage is fresh from scooping up the U23 Australian time trial title in Perth and also stretched his legs in the first two stages of the new top-tier Australian domestic series, ProVelo Super League, which has a stagiaire contract with Jayco-AlUla up for grabs for the U23 men‚Äôs winner.</p>\n<p>At around 100km to go the margin to the ambitious 21-year-old duo was 4:45 with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe sending one rider, Filip Maciejuk, up the front to try and keep the break in check so Sam Welsford could have his sprint chance. Then as the stage progressed fresh riders appeared, with Bahrain Victorious contributing as they looked to the chances of Phil Bauhaus. By the time there was 50km to go the gap was down to under three minutes. There was also an acceleration as the peloton competed for the remaining bonus second left, with Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) dashing out to take the advantage.</p>\n<p>By the time the riders made their first pass through Gumeracha, the teams had started to group together and keep chipping away at the gap. Browning swept up the top points on the final KOM at Berry Hill at 29.5km to go and with that he clinched the climber&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt long after that the leading duo had to concede that their time at the front of the Tour Down Under was done, for today at least, and the time had come for a pat on the back before they were absorbed back into the peloton with around 23km to go. The field was back together and it was now time for the teams to start getting organised for the sprint. </p>\n<p>Teams jostled at the front, with riders battling to get the wheels of the top sprinters, as the peloton sped to the finish line. With three kilometres to go, a crash took down Australian champion Luke Durbridge (Jayco-AlUla) and a few other riders.</p>\n<p>No team managed to take control as Ineos-Grenadiers, Alpecin-Deceuninck all took turns at the front but Welsford stayed on the wheel of his leadout man until the final 250 metres.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The race is often a place where Australian riders rise to the top, putting their best foot forward as they return from Europe to race on home soil, but with the strong international field delivered by its WorldTour status, there is no guarantee they will have it all their way. </p>\n<p>Sam Welsford of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe claimed victory on stage 1 of the Tour Down Under after launching his sprint early and holding off his rivals in a chaotic finale. As Welsford was celebrating just before crossing the line, Matthew Brennan (Visma-Lease A Bike) who was flying up, ran out of road and had to settle for second place. </p>\n<p>Matthew Walls (Groupama-FDJ) was third.</p>\n<p>Having won three stages last year, and the Down Under Classic days ago, Sam Welsford was a marked rider and the peloton looked to his team to control the pace. His teammates Filip Maciejuk and Ben Zwiehoff kept the breakaway within a manageable five-minute gap before two other teams joined the effort midway through the stage, finally reeling in the two escapees with 23 kilometres remaining.</p>\n<p>Once the pair was reeled in, Welsford slotted behind his leadout man Danny van Poppel in the peloton while the teams jostled for position at the front, before jumping with 250 metres to go. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúBloody hell. I get sick and tired of going early now that&#8217;s enough,‚Äù Welsford said a laugh. ‚ÄúSuper hard run in, I probably stepped off Danny a little bit too early. Actually,  I think he had a lot more to give, and he did such a big good job, and he was on the front for so long.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThat last straight was super hard to control the front. It was pretty hard, and they were getting dive-bombed every corner, so we had to kind of come back a bit and wait. We ran out of guys, but boys did an amazing job today. And we took it on, we were the only team riding all day until the end, and then so happy to pay them back for the win.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Welsford admits that he was surprised by Brennan coming up on his left side.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI checked when I went and I was like, oh, this is long. And I could see someone underneath me, under my shoulder,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd then my legs were burning, like maybe 15 meters ago, and now I saw him kind of distance off, so I checked right, and then realized I had him. But then he came on the left when I saluted, and I was like, oh no, don&#8217;t tell me, but I think I had enough room, but I was just so cooked I couldn&#8217;t even get the other arm up.‚Äù</p>\n<p>&#8220;Coming second is really nice, and got to say big thanks to the team,&#8221; Brennan said. &#8220;Just in the final few Ks, just, just trying to figure it out. And managed to find that little slot on the side of the side of the road, and went for it. &#8221;</p>\n<p>Welsford claims the first ochre leader‚Äôs jersey of the 2025 Tour Down Under. He leads the general classification with four seconds on Brennan. Zac Marriage (ARA Australia) who spent the majority of the stage in the break, sits in third place, five seconds down by virtue of the time bonus seconds taken in the intermediate sprints.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 should deliver another chance for the sprinters on the 128.8km route starting and ending in Tanuda. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe long line of team cars lined up at the start in Prospect, not far north of Adelaide, as the riders got set for the first of six days of racing that would take them through Adelaide and the surrounding hills and vineyards of South Australia. The 150.7km stage to Gumeracha, the home in the hills of the giant rocking horse, was always slated as one for the sprinters but it certainly wasn‚Äôt a flat journey, with 2,386m of elevation gain through the sunny stage with temperatures in the low 30‚Äôs.</p>\n<p>It was an early launch for the break, with the flurry of attacks ultimately resulting in a three man group as Bastien Tronchon (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) was joined by two riders from the ARA Australian Cycling Team, Fergus Browning and Zac Marriage. Browning took top points at the first KOM at just 11.2km in the race and then the group worked together on the undulating tree-lined roads to stretch the gap to around five minutes with 130km to go.</p>\n<p>At the sprint in Williamstown, with 109.7km still ahead, Tronchon took the points and then soon decided it was time to sit up. The two Australians however, weren‚Äôt going to let their moment out the front of the WorldTour race end so soon.</p>\n<p>Browning, who won the U23 men‚Äôs Australian road race championships last year, had been making a mark in Europe with Trinity last season though the rider who won stage 1 of the Tour de l‚ÄôAin was left adrift by the closure of its road squad, so is on the lookout for a way back. Marriage is fresh from scooping up the U23 Australian time trial title in Perth and also stretched his legs in the first two stages of the new top-tier Australian domestic series, ProVelo Super League, which has a stagiaire contract with Jayco-AlUla up for grabs for the U23 men‚Äôs winner.</p>\n<p>At around 100km to go the margin to the ambitious 21-year-old duo was 4:45 with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe sending one rider, Filip Maciejuk, up the front to try and keep the break in check so Sam Welsford could have his sprint chance. Then as the stage progressed fresh riders appeared, with Bahrain Victorious contributing as they looked to the chances of Phil Bauhaus. By the time there was 50km to go the gap was down to under three minutes. There was also an acceleration as the peloton competed for the remaining bonus second left, with Jhonatan Narv√°ez (UAE Team Emirates-XRG) dashing out to take the advantage.</p>\n<p>By the time the riders made their first pass through Gumeracha, the teams had started to group together and keep chipping away at the gap. Browning swept up the top points on the final KOM at Berry Hill at 29.5km to go and with that he clinched the climber&#8217;s jersey.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt long after that the leading duo had to concede that their time at the front of the Tour Down Under was done, for today at least, and the time had come for a pat on the back before they were absorbed back into the peloton with around 23km to go. The field was back together and it was now time for the teams to start getting organised for the sprint. </p>\n<p>Teams jostled at the front, with riders battling to get the wheels of the top sprinters, as the peloton sped to the finish line. With three kilometres to go, a crash took down Australian champion Luke Durbridge (Jayco-AlUla) and a few other riders.</p>\n<p>No team managed to take control as Ineos-Grenadiers, Alpecin-Deceuninck all took turns at the front but Welsford stayed on the wheel of his leadout man until the final 250 metres.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=1&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will begin on 17th of January in Brighton and will finish on 19th of January in Stirling.</p>\n<p>Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) survived an onslaught of attacks in the final 30 kilometres to win the 2025 Women&#8217;s Tour Down Under in Stirling. The Swiss champion fought til the end and finished third on the stage to secure her first WorldTour stage race victory. </p>\n<p>R√ºegg, isolated, faced relentless challenges from multiple teams, particularly Lidl-Trek, repeatedly forcing her to close gaps on her own. Despite the continuous pressure, none of the attacks succeeded, leading to a reduced bunch sprint.</p>\n<p>R√ºegg admitted that defending the ochre leader&#8217;s jersey was &#8220;quite a challenge.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, they didn&#8217;t make it easy for us. For sure, they tried a lot of moves, especially in the last two laps. The first three laps were actually quite OK. I expected it to be harder, and then, I was just super nervous, honestly, the whole day, I was like, I really want to bring it home,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And the team did amazing again, and so I could kind of save all my energy in the beginning and then just focused on the last two laps followed all the moves. And I could keep it until the end. I&#8217;m super happy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Following her teammate‚Äôs wheel,  Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) bided her time in the reduced peloton and opened her sprint in the final uphill metres to take the stage victory. Crossing the line one second later, Silke Smulders (Liv AlUla Jayco) finished second on the stage, just ahead of R√ºegg.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s really good,&#8221; Dygert said of the stage victory. &#8220;We came here to try to get GC and to get a stage win. And so, we really worked hard today. We went all in for the stage win because GC was kind of out of contention, so we all put in a huge effort for today, and we&#8217;re really happy to pull it off.‚Äù</p>\n<p>R√ºegg topped the final general classification with 13 seconds on Smulders. Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (UNO-X Mobility) retained her third place overall, at 37 seconds in arrears.</p>\n<p>Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian Cycling Team) sprinted to the maximum points in the second QOM of the stage to secure the mountains classification victory while R√ºegg, with her stage victory and third in the finale brought home the points classification in addition to the overall.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nIce vests and a spot in the air-conditioned comfort of the team mini-vans were key at the start of the 105.9 kilometre finale starting and finishing in Stirling with the temperature already creeping over 30¬∞C before the morning start to racing. Then when it came to lining up the lumps from ice stockings tucked into the back of the jerseys were prominent.</p>\n<p>Everyone was getting ready for a hot stage of racing, both with the temperature and action on the road, particularly as the unrelenting course provided continued GC hope to those who hadn‚Äôt made the mark on the overall they had hoped to on Willunga Hill.</p>\n<p>When the race set off for the first of five unrelenting loops, which would deliver a total of 2,142m of elevation gain through the stage, the peloton was initially largely content to stay together. The first pass of the finish line spurred some action, with Queen of the Mountain points up for grabs and a tight battle at the top of that category. Dominika Wlodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) had stepped into the jersey on the Willunga stage but by just one point ahead of Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian Cycling Team).</p>\n<p>Wlodarczyk‚Äôs teammates Karlijn Swinkels and Sofia Bertizzolo came to the fore to sweep up points at 85.2km to go but Polites still grabbed one with fourth, equalling up the competition.</p>\n<p>Niamh Fisher Black (Lidl-Trek) then triggered a flurry of attacks at 71km to go. Groups formed and were caught but the ultimate outcome was that Ella Simpson (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93) kicked on out the front alone carving out a gap of 1:30 by the time the race looped through the start/finish line again at 63.2km to go.</p>\n<p>There were points when the gap fell below a minute during the next lap, particularly when Maike van der Duin (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) strung out the peloton with her scorching attack, but Simpson kept tapping away and had pulled the margin to around two minutes as she approached Stirling for another pass.</p>\n<p>With the kilometres ticking down to under 40km to go the flurries continued as the teams worked to put the pressure on the EF Education-Oatly team of the ochre jersey-clad Noemi R√ºegg. The aggressive moves, with plenty coming from Lidl-Trek meant Simpson‚Äôs gap was quickly chewed up, with the 22-year-old swallowed up by the peloton and the race was all together at 35km to go.</p>\n<p>Though there were soon plenty of efforts to break it apart, with Amanda Spratt (Lidl-Trek), who had been active through the race, off the front again, and Emily Watts tried to replicate the earlier move of her St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93 teammate but the peloton was on its toes. The toll could be seen at the back, with riders tailing off.</p>\n<p>The attacks kept rolling as the race counted down toward 25km to go, with race leader R√ºegg herself chasing down one from 2020 winner Ruth Edwards (Human Powered Health).</p>\n<p>At 21.3km to go, the battle for the QOM classification played out, with Wlodarczyk and Polites out front with teammate Nicole Frain. The former Liv-AlUla-Jayco rider played her hand to perfection, timing the sprint so she could claim top points ahead of the Polish champion by half a wheel. With that effort Polites secured the climbers jersey.</p>\n<p>In the final lap, and down to 16km to go, Tiffany Cromwell (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) delivered down multiple attacks and then teammate Van der Duin put in another, getting a gap and stretching out and splintering the field in pursuit behind.</p>\n<p>The gap was over 20 seconds as the race neared 10km to go but soon she was reeled back in. With just over 7km to go it was Lauretta Hanson‚Äôs turn to pour on the pressure onto the shrinking peloton for Lidl-Trek and then it was New Zealand champion Ella Wyllie who clipped off the front for Liv AlUla Jayco. She remained out front until around 3.5km to go and then in the final two kilometres the peloton split further after a small touch of wheels.</p>\n<p>Into the last two kilometres and it was a group of around 20 out the front, then into the final kilometre, Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM zondacrypto) opened up, finishing off an aggressive stage for her team with a trip to the top step.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

And then when I did the recon of this climb, I thought, well, that&#8217;s actually also pretty good for me.

This is my first win on the WorldTour level. I also just want to enjoy it. And, tomorrow we will see, but today was amazing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe heat was on for the queen stage of the women&#8217;s Santos Tour Down Under, with clear blue skies and soaring temperatures making a tough day in the saddle even harder. Three riders dropped out before the start &#8211; Mara Roldan (Picnic-PostNl), who collapsed after the finish and ended her day in an ambulance, understandably did not start stage 2. Two others, Eglantine Rayer (FDJ-SUEZ) and Teuntje Beekhuis (Uno-X Mobility), also dropped out.</p>\n<p>The remaining 79 riders departed Unley and the race stayed together for the first 10km as the route went straight uphill to Windy Point, where Polish champion Dominika Wlodarczyk (UAE Team ADQ) led at the summit ahead of mountains classification leader Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian National Team).</p>\n<p>Not long after the climb, Polites&#8217; teammate Alli Andersen went on the attack, but she could only open up a lead of about 30 seconds. The pace heated up and Andersen was caught on an unclassified ascent after 23.5km of racing.</p>\n<p>The team continued their aggressive tactics, launching Maeve Plouffe off the front immediately after. Plouffe managed a lead of nearly a minute, but a counter-attack from FDJ-SUEZ&#8217;s Marie Le Net drew out an 11-rider chase with Amber Pate (Liv AlUla Jayco), Kristyna Burlova (Ceratizit-WNT), Rachele Barbieri (Picnic-PostNL), Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ), Maike van der Duin (Canyon-Sram), Babette van der Wolf (EF Education-Oatly) and Emily Watts (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber 93), among others. However, the peloton immediately closed the move down.</p>\n<p>The race settled in for a short while before Anderson attacked again after the feed zone with 62.5km to go and pulled out a lead of 42 seconds before the intermediate sprint, where Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) continued her push for the points jersey, taking the points behind Anderson.</p>\n<p>Ten riders attacked after the sprint and began chipping away at Anderson&#8217;s advantage. They had her in sight with 56.2km to go but the peloton reeled the chase group in and then sat up.</p>\n<p>With the first ascent of Willunga still more than 20km away, Anderson was allowed a gap of 1:10 before an attack from Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ) started to chip into the gap. She made it across to Anderson with 40km to go, with a gap of more than a minute on the bunch.</p>\n<p>Canyon-SRAM took up the chase, stringing out the bunch much as they did on the opening stage, and then tried to launch Maike van der Duin. Two successive crashes took down Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) first and then her teammate Niamh Fisher-Black along with Lauren Bates (ARA Australian National Team), but all were quickly back up and in the peloton.</p>\n<p>The lead pair&#8217;s gap was out to 1:30 with 5km til the second intermediate sprint but with the start of the first ascent of Willunga right after it, the chase picked up and carved 35 seconds out of their advantage at the sprint.</p>\n<p>Wollaston left Anderson behind as the grade kicked in but the chase was on from the GC riders, and she too was back in the fold before the summit.</p>\n<p>Amanda Spratt led teammate Fisher-Black past Wollaston with 25km to go and 2.1km until the crest of Willunga Hill and continued to push the pace until the final kilometre, shedding all but about 18 riders.</p>\n<p>Fisher-Black led the small lead group over the summit, and then Elise Chabbey (FDJ-SUEZ) attacked. The Swiss rider was quickly reeled in by Chlo√© Dygert (Canyon-SRAM) before Chabbey&#8217;s teammate Amber Kraak tried to launch a move.</p>\n<p>The attacks continued with Alice Towers pushing the pace for Canyon-SRAM but Kim Cadzow (EF Education-Oatly) shut that move down.</p>\n<p>On the descent, Chabbey drilled it, pulling away six riders with a couple more scrambling across aas the speed of the riders touched nearly 90kph. With 10km to go and only 11 riders still in the front, Dygert launched a searing attack to rejoin the lead group and teammate Towers.</p>\n<p>With 7.4km to go, Ceratizit-WNT&#8217;s Dilyxine Miermont attacked and was covered by Ella Simpson (St Michel-Preference Home-Auber93). Behind, a second group joined the lead dozen.</p>\n<p>Spratt, Swinkels and Dygert went on the move with 6km to go but the larger group was able to shut them down rapidly and the wind briefly went out of the lead group as the final climb approached.</p>\n<p>Dygert wasn&#8217;t content to ride easy and powered clear, chased immediately by Julie van de Velde (AG Insurance-Soudal) and Kraak but the American reached Willunga solo.</p>\n<p>Fisher-Black accelerated past the two chasers with 3km to go and then past Dygert. Bradbury leapt across to the Kiwi, and soon Silke Smulder (Liv-AlUla-Jayco) and Noemi R√ºegg (EF Education-Oatly) joined in, too.</p>\n<p>With Chabbey and Wlodarczyk approaching, Fisher-Black accelerated but the two came across with 2km to go and the pace in the lead group briefly dropped.

Smulders managed to stay with her briefly but eventually had to let go, finishing 10 seconds behind to claim second place.</p>\n<p>Mie Bj√∏rndal Ottestad (Uno-X Mobility) led a small chase group to the line, taking third, 26 seconds behind the winner.

The 22-year-old Dutch rider kept her head down, pushing the gap to two minutes inside of 30 kilometres to go.</p>\n<p>Alarms starting to ring in the peloton and Canyon-SRAM sent Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell to the front to chase, but without any concerted help from other teams, the peloton was too late to catch the solo rider.  </p>\n<p>Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ) took the chaotic field sprint for second place and Kathrin Schweinberger (Human Powered Health) was third.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld admitted that her attack was in response to suffering on the lone categorized climb of the day.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was actually not even thinking, I was just it&#8217;s a new team and we wanted to be aggressive and I was actually struggling on the climb and I was like well, I better just go now because everybody is struggling.

Schweinberger is a further two seconds back.</p>\n<p>Stage 2 should deliver the most decisive of the three days of racing as the peloton tackles 115km from Unley to the top of Willunga Hill.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\n82 riders made up the peloton for the first Women‚Äôs WorldTour race of the year as Marit Raaijmakers (Human Powered Health) and Anouska Koster of UNO-X Mobility were non-starters.</p>\n<p>The bunch remained together through the first 18km until Alyssa Polites (ARA Australian National Team) launched a move and, not drawing out any companions, she forged on alone. The 2021 triple junior national champion who raced with Jayco-AlUla in 2023 looked to have something to prove with her attack, and she gained a maximum of 2:30 before the peloton got to work to control the gap.</p>\n<p>A crash from Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) briefly interrupted the chasing peloton as half a dozen riders came down with her, but the pace soon picked up and Polites&#8217; gap began to fall.</p>\n<p>Polites led through the first intermediate sprint and, more importantly, stayed clear for the sole classified climb on Heatherdale Hill with 54km to go to secure the lead in the mountains classification. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the summit, the peloton breezed past with counter-attacks flying.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the finish line right on the QOM,&#8221; Polites said. &#8220;They just really egged me on in the car. And I made it across.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit-WNT) was the next attacker to go clear solo into the crosswind. With 45.5km to go, a counter-attack of four riders from the peloton went after the Dutch woman, including Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Only Marturano continued in pursuit of the solo leader as the peloton was happy to save their legs for the final 45km. Hengeveld having a lead of only 28 seconds on the bunch contributed to the lack of motivation to chase.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld stayed clear for the second intermediate sprint with 30.1km to go, having carved out a gap of well over one minute while Marturano was absorbed by the peloton. Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) mopped up the points for second place in the sprint, adding to her tally after doing the same in the first intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>On the uncategorised climb inside the final 30km, Hengeveld added to her advantage, approaching the summit of the steepest pitch with two minutes in hand and only 27.5km to go. However, the 22-year-old had five more kilometres of gradual climbing and a long descent into Aldinga Beach ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite teams like Canyon-SRAM with Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell, Hengeveld&#8217;s gap was nearly three minutes as she neared the final 20km of the stage. Once the climbs were over, FDJ-SUEZ, AG Insurance-Soudal and EF-Education-Oatly sent riders to help nullify Hengeveld&#8217;s 2:30 lead, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be coming down fast enough.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld still had almost 2 minutes on the field with only 8.5 kilometres and her gap was just too much for the field. A furtive chase in the closing kilometres failed to bring the Dutch rider back, and she finished 42 seconds ahead of the peloton led home by Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The 2021 triple junior national champion who raced with Jayco-AlUla in 2023 looked to have something to prove with her attack, and she gained a maximum of 2:30 before the peloton got to work to control the gap.</p>\n<p>A crash from Felicity Wilson-Haffenden (Lidl-Trek) briefly interrupted the chasing peloton as half a dozen riders came down with her, but the pace soon picked up and Polites&#8217; gap began to fall.</p>\n<p>Polites led through the first intermediate sprint and, more importantly, stayed clear for the sole classified climb on Heatherdale Hill with 54km to go to secure the lead in the mountains classification. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the summit, the peloton breezed past with counter-attacks flying.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had the finish line right on the QOM,&#8221; Polites said. &#8220;They just really egged me on in the car. And I made it across.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Daniek Hengeveld (Ceratizit-WNT) was the next attacker to go clear solo into the crosswind. With 45.5km to go, a counter-attack of four riders from the peloton went after the Dutch woman, including Ella Wyllie (Liv AlUla Jayco) and Greta Marturano (UAE Team ADQ).</p>\n<p>Only Marturano continued in pursuit of the solo leader as the peloton was happy to save their legs for the final 45km. Hengeveld having a lead of only 28 seconds on the bunch contributed to the lack of motivation to chase.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld stayed clear for the second intermediate sprint with 30.1km to go, having carved out a gap of well over one minute while Marturano was absorbed by the peloton. Karlijn Swinkels (UAE Team ADQ) mopped up the points for second place in the sprint, adding to her tally after doing the same in the first intermediate sprint.</p>\n<p>On the uncategorised climb inside the final 30km, Hengeveld added to her advantage, approaching the summit of the steepest pitch with two minutes in hand and only 27.5km to go. However, the 22-year-old had five more kilometres of gradual climbing and a long descent into Aldinga Beach ahead.</p>\n<p>Despite teams like Canyon-SRAM with Chlo√© Dygert and Tiffany Cromwell, Hengeveld&#8217;s gap was nearly three minutes as she neared the final 20km of the stage. Once the climbs were over, FDJ-SUEZ, AG Insurance-Soudal and EF-Education-Oatly sent riders to help nullify Hengeveld&#8217;s 2:30 lead, but it didn&#8217;t seem to be coming down fast enough.</p>\n<p>Hengeveld still had almost 2 minutes on the field with only 8.5 kilometres and her gap was just too much for the field. A furtive chase in the closing kilometres failed to bring the Dutch rider back, and she finished 42 seconds ahead of the peloton led home by Ally Wollaston (FDJ-SUEZ).</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9080&#038;y=2025&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Matev≈æ Govekar (Bahrain Victorious) won the final stage of the Gree-Tour of Guangxi, claiming the sprint from a reduced peloton while Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto-Dstny) secured the overall victory by finishing among the lead bunch after stepping into the red leader&#8217;s jersey on Saturday&#8217;s summit finish.</p>\n<p>Marijn van den Berg (EF Education-EasyPost) came second in the hard-fought final stage race of the WorldTour for 2024. He just held off Robert Stannard who made it two riders for Bahrain-Victorious on the podium in the 134km stage 6, run over five loops punctuated with a category 2 climb.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt came over the Nanning finish line in 25th place, safely within the lead bunch of over 30 riders, on a dynamic day of racing where little was left settled until the final stages.</p>\n<p>The young Lotto-Dstny rider, however, played his cards with aplomb to successfully make both his first and last WorldTour races of the year general classification winning outings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting in the leader&#8217;s jersey on the last day is always stressful. You know that everyone will ride against you, but it is also great to be able to ride in that jersey,&#8221; Van Eetvelt said later. &#8220;Before the start, we said that no one from UAE Emirates was allowed to join the breakaway, certainly not Tim Wellens and Pavel Sivakov.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end we decided to let Tim go, to try to control him afterwards. I think that was the right decision. The boys rode very strongly and luckily we also got some support from DSM-Firmenich PostNL. That made it possible to keep the break within range. There were also a lot of attacks after the last climb, but I still felt very good myself. It&#8217;s great to still be able to do this on the last day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you had told me before the start of the season that I would win one WorldTour race, I would have been very happy. But to win two, that is‚Äì I don‚Äôt really think about it, but I can be more than happy with this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The 23-year-old Belgian also swept up the youth classification, claiming both the red and white jersey ahead of Oscar Onley (dsm-firmenich-PostNL) while Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) held onto the points jersey win by just one point. </p>\n<p>Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-Quickstep) clinched the mountains classification, which for a while looked at risk after a throw of the dice from second-placed Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates) was neutralised just as the final points were within sight.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThere were 117 riders lined up for the final stage of the last WorldTour race of the season on Sunday, a number of the 129 starters missing due to crashes earlier in the event, but with a last chance at a top-tier victory for 2024 at stake, the competition was still as fierce as ever.</p>\n<p>The circuit around the capital city of Guangxi, which the riders would tackle five times, included a category 2 climb ‚Äì 1.4km with an average gradient of 11.7% ‚Äì each lap. The King of the Mountain points were up for grabs on the first, third and fifth lap while the intermediate sprints fell on laps two and four.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt had started the day with a five-second lead on the overall classification to second-placed Oscar Onley (dsm-firmenich PostNL), while in the points competition Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) was sitting on 38 points, nine ahead of Max Kanter (Astana-Qazaqstan). Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-Quickstep) got to line up in the polka dot jersey again, with 28 points in mountain classification and Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates) was next with 20, which meant all were still in play on the final day.</p>\n<p>When the flag dropped it was immediately a fast and furious competition. The first KOM points at 5.9km ‚Äì 8, 4 and 2 ‚Äì were swept up by R√©mi Cavagna (Movistar), Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates) and Max Poole (DSM Firmenich-Post NL). Then it wasn‚Äôt long before there was a break and a split in the peloton that Van Eetvelt managed to stay on the right side of. </p>\n<p>Wellens jumped into a break of eight and with two KOM points opportunities to go it‚Äôs no surprise that Reinderink was among those who went off in pursuit of the rider who was in second place in the mountains classification that he was leading. </p>\n<p>The Soudal-Quickstep rider, however, didn‚Äôt make the junction and it was around a minute gap to the lead group with 100km of racing remaining. The group included Wellens, Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier (Lidl-Trek), Tosh Van der Sande (Visma-Lease a Bike), Stan Dewulf (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Michael Leonard (Ineos Grenadiers) and Esteban Chaves (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>Wellens swept up the top sprint points at 52.4km into the day of racing but he didn‚Äôt manage to repeat with the KOM points at 60km, with Dewulf and Ghebreigzabhier cresting ahead of him and leaving just two points for the third-placed Wellens. However, there was still another opportunity to bridge the points gap if Wellens could hold on at the front for the final climb at around 20km to go.</p>\n<p>By the halfway point of the final day of racing in the WorldTour for 2024, the gap was closer to two minutes, though that was before the pace heated up in the peloton. A group of riders losing touch also formed out the back, Reinderink among it, meaning there was little he could do to counter Wellens in his pursuit of the final mountain points. </p>\n<p>The gap between the leaders and the peloton was down to 45 seconds by the 33km to go. By the final climb the lead group was in reach, caught at 20km to go and with that junction went Wellen‚Äôs chance to capture the mountains classification. </p>\n<p>The field was splintering on the climb, but Van Eetvelt was ever attentive at the front, determined not to let his hard-earned overall lead slip at the final pass. Sivakov swept up the final lot of 8 KOM points, with Van Eetvelt second and Alex Baudin (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) third.</p>\n<p>There were attacks, but none that lasted and it was now a drastically reduced peloton heading to the line for the final time, with little more than 30 riders still in contention as the kilometres ticked under 5 to go.</p>\n<p>There were attempts to get a jump but in the end, it came down to a spread-out sprint, with Bahrain-Victorious making their presence felt at the front. Govekar dashed out from Van den Berg‚Äôs wheel at just the right moment to claim his first WorldTour victory while Stannard crept up behind to take third, hitting the podium for the first time since his return to the peloton in September.</p>\n<p>Sunday‚Äôs stage completed the WorldTour season for 2024, with the Tour Down Under opening up the new season on January 21, 2025.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In the last 15km, the pace completely went out of the chase, and Borghesi and Alonso had plenty of time to play cat-and-mouse coming into the final kilometre.</p>\n<p>Alonso refused to take over from Borghesi, then launched her sprint out of the Italian&#8217;s slipstream to take her first Women&#8217;s WorldTour victory. Then 2:49 minutes later, Lach won the sprint for third place.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter several editions in Guilin where a sprint finish was a certainty, the 2024 race was held under tropical conditions with temperatures above 30¬∞C in Guangxi‚Äôs provincial capital of Nanning. The peloton had to do five laps of a 27.2km circuit that included the 1.4km, 11% climb of Qingxiu Mountain. There were QOM points on offer on the first, third, and final laps while intermediate sprints were put on at the finish line after the second and fourth laps.</p>\n<p>Tiril J√∏rgensen (Team Coop-Repsol) won the first QOM sprint ahead of Idoia Eraso (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) and Aurela Nerlo (Winspace). The three riders had gone clear on the climb but were reeled in again soon afterwards.</p>\n<p>Early on the third lap, Eraso went on a solo attack, winning the second QOM sprint, with J√∏rgensen and Silvia Zanardi (Human Powered Health) picking up the remaining points from a chase group that had formed on the climb and also included Laura Tomasi (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), Elena Pirrone (Roland), Kathrin Schweinberger (Ceratizit-WNT), Anne Knijnenburg (VolkerWessels), Karolina Kumiƒôga (UAE Team ADQ), and Hanna Tserakh (BTC Ljubljana Zhiraf Ambedo).</p>\n<p>55km from the finish, just before passing the finish line with two laps to go, Eraso was caught by this chase group. On the climb, Pirrone, Kumiƒôga, Knijnenburg, and J√∏rgensen dropped the other five riders, and Tamara Dronova (Roland) bridged to the front after having attacked from the peloton.</p>\n<p>Further behind, Barbara Malcotti (Human Powered Health) put in a hard attack that split the peloton completely, picking up the dropped riders from the chase group as more riders went off the front on the climb and descent.</p>\n<p>When these two groups had come together, Borghesi launched a strong attack with 35.5km to go that only Alonso could follow, and as the other riders looked at each other, the Italian-Spanish duo quickly built a gap.</p>\n<p>1:16 minutes ahead going into the final lap, Borghesi did the pacing on the last ascent of Qingxiu Mountain as Alonso looked to be at her limit. The 26-year-old Spaniard had bluffed, though, jumping clear from Borghesi‚Äôs wheel in the final 100 metres of the climb. Borghesi closed the gap over the top, and they soon fell back into their familiar cooperative rhythm.</p>\n<p>The chase group of 20 riders had split on the climb, and 58 seconds behind Alonso, J√∏rgensen took the last remaining mountain point to win the QOM classification. Malcotti, Knijnenburg, Eleonora Gasparrini (UAE Team ADQ), Laura Asencio (Ceratizit-WNT), Nadia Quagliotto (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi), and J√∏rgensen did not push on, though, allowing Ur≈°a Pintar (BTC Ljubljana Zhiraf Ambedo) and Nerlo to get back after the descent.</p>\n<p>Asencio and Malcotti obviously had no interest in chasing down their teammates, and other riders had teammates trying to chase back, so the cooperation in the group wasn‚Äôt great. When Rachael Wales (ARA-Skip Capital) and Kumiƒôga came back with 12.5km to go, the Polish rider went right past the group to go on the attack but could not get away.</p>\n<p>As Alonso and Borghesi traded turns at the front, more riders returned to the chase group that grew to 17 riders, three of which were from Ceratizit-WNT while Human Powered Health had two riders there. They effectively shut down all attempts to form a cohesive chase, prompting J√∏rgensen to launch an attack. She was covered by Laura Asencio (Ceratizit-WNT) and did not get away.</p>\n<p>The next to try a move was Cristina Tonetti (Laboral Kutxa-Fundaci√≥n Euskadi) with about 4km to go. She got a gap but was eventually reeled in as well, but the front duo‚Äôs advantage had gone out to well over two minutes by now, leaving the group to race for third place.</p>\n<p>Up front, Alonso and Borghesi started playing cat-and-mouse, with Borghesi asking Alonso to come to the front by repeatedly flicking her elbow. Alonso was happy to sit on Borghesi‚Äôs wheel, though, even as the Italian did several fake sprints on the final kilometre. Finally, Alonso came out of the slipstream with 175 metres to go, easily beating Borghesi and raising her hands on the line to celebrate.</p>\n<p>Magdalene Lind (Team Coop-Repsol) launched an attack at the flamme rouge but had four riders following her and effectively just ended up leading out the sprint. Lach went early with 300 metres to go and pulled away with Schweinberger on her wheel, and the two Ceratizit-WNT riders took third and fourth place.</p>\n<p>As the race brings the 2024 season of top-tier racing to a close, World Champion Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) is now confirmed as the Women‚Äôs WorldTour overall ranking winner while Shirin van Anrooij (Lidl-Trek) claimed the U23 ranking.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9059&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=9059&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto-Dstny) surged to victory on stage 5 of the Gree-Tour of Guangxi, claiming the all-important summit victory on Saturday and in the process capturing the overall race lead.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt put down the power as the summit finish drew ever nearer, claiming the win by taking off on Oscar Onley (DSM Firmenich-PostNL). Onley came second after the pair caught and then quickly blew past Victor Lafay (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale) when the line was tantalisingly close. Lafay then pushed onto the line with his teammate Alex Baudin, who was third, while Lafay had to settle for fourth.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn‚Äôt feel very good at first today,&#8221; Van Eetvelt said in a Lotto-Dstny media statement. &#8220;But when the team wants to work for you, you can‚Äôt complain, and you just have to give it everything you‚Äôve got.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The first big attack in the final stages of the climb came from UAE Team Emirates rider Tim Wellens within the final two kilometres, with Lafay linking on and then riding on by.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When Tim Wellens attacked, I thought today wasn‚Äôt going to be my day,&#8221; said Van Eetvelt. &#8220;But the last kilometre is so tough and I know how to keep my own pace on such sections, so I just kept going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt&#8217;s win on the decisive GC stage put the 23-year-old in the red leaders jersey with Onley five seconds back and Baudin 15 seconds behind with just one stage to go. As a result, it looks like Van Eetvelt, who started the season with the overall win at the UAE Tour, could bookend his 2024 season with WorldTour GC wins. </p>\n<p>Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-Quickstep) held onto his lead in the mountains classification while Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) also maintained his top points spot and the race leading. Belgian Lotto-Dstny rider also replaced Filip Maciejuk (Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe) at the top of the youth classification.</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nStage 5 of the Tour of Guangxi was always expected to be the day for the overall contenders as while the sprinters ruled through the four opening stages a summit finish on Saturday finally gave the climbers their opportunity to prosper and take the red jersey which had so far been shared among the fast finishers.</p>\n<p>There was more climbing on Friday‚Äôs stage 4, but the difference on Saturday‚Äôs 165.8km stage from Yizhou to Nongla was the summit finish. In fact, the total elevation gain sat at just 1420m as it was a relatively flat run through the largest part of the stage, with the first categorised climb, a category 3, coming after 100km of the stage had already been completed.</p>\n<p>After the race set out from Hechi City Center Square the EF Education-EasyPost duo of Jonas Rutsch and Stefan Bissegger established a gap with Koen Bouwman (Visma-Lease a Bike) and stage 2 winner Warre Vangheluwe (Soudal-Quickstep), with the margin around 2:40 by 20km into the day of racing. </p>\n<p>Not surprisingly the speedy Vangheluwe took the top sprint points at 60.7km while Rutsch claimed the top KOM points on the wet roads at 117km into the day of racing and the stage 2 winner also claimed the top spot in the second intermediate sprint at 142km.</p>\n<p>By this time the gap was getting closer to a minute, with the dsm firmenich-PostNL team of Oscar Onley and Max Poole plus the Lidl-Trek squad of Quinn Simmons working up the front of the bunch. Still, the break continued to hold, though Rutsch ultimately fell away. By the time he was swept back into the main group at 10km to go the gap was still at around 1:20.</p>\n<p>Into the final five kilometres as the road kicked up the margin quickly fell and Bouwman, in his last race with Visma-Lease a Bike, decided to go it alone. Bissegger and Vangheluwe were quickly swept up while Bouwman remained out the front. Still as he passed the 4km to go marker, a quick look back over the shoulder showed that it wouldn‚Äôt be long before he too was swept up.</p>\n<p>Lotto pushed the pace at the front, trying to set up the final move for Lennert Van Eetvelt, on the decisive category 1 finishing climb to Nongla ‚Äì a 3.2km ascent with a gradient averaging 6.3%. It was, however, Wellens who first took advantage, launching at around 1.5km to go and Victor Lafay (Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale) quickly jumped on his wheel and then took off solo. </p>\n<p>For a while it looked like that could be the move of the day, but the chase ramped up behind and within hundreds of metres of the line Onley and Van Eetvelt caught the Decathlon-AG2R-La Mondiale rider and continued right on by.</p>\n<p>Van Eetvelt then jumped from Onley‚Äôs wheel and quickly carved out a decisive winning margin as the dsm firmenich-PostNL&#8217;s riders pursuit was quickly curtailed by the realisation that he just couldn‚Äôt dig any deeper.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe boys rode really well today controlling the break and positioning myself and Max into the climb,&#8221; Onley said in a statement. &#8220;On the climb it just came down to the legs for the both of us. I‚Äôm happy to come away with the second place and pick up another consistent result after a long season.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There have been plenty of ups and downs for winner Van Eetvelt this season, from winning the UAE Tour to being sidelined with knee issues and being hit by a car while out training, but now he looks set to finish the season on a high note ‚Äì  just Sunday‚Äôs 134km final stage stands between him and overall victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=5&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) took back-to-back stage wins at the Gree-Tour of Guangxi in China, holding off a late charge from Max Kanter (Astana Qazaqstan) at the end of stage into Jinchengjiang after a day in the hills.</p>\n<p>Vernon originally extended his overall lead thanks to a ten-second time bonus for his stage victory, however, official results showed he had received a 20-second time penalty for an in-race infraction &#8211; reportedly a stick bottle &#8211; and so he lost the leader&#8217;s red jersey to Kanter.</p>\n<p>The Brit launched his sprint after perfect lead-out from compatriot Jake Stewart, who brought him up late in the final 300 metres. Vernon sprint to the line to take his third win of the season.</p>\n<p>Alberto Bruttomesso (Bahrain Victorious) was third behind Vernon and Kanter after the peloton had reeled in the remains of the day&#8217;s breakaway in the final 2.5km.</p>\n<p>Kanter took over the race from Juan Sebastian Molano (UAE Team Emirates) after he finished way down in 13th in the sprint. The German has a one-second lead on Stan Dewulf (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and a two-second lead on Molano heading into the key GC stage on Saturday.</p>\n<p>It will likely be Kanter&#8217;s only day in the leader&#8217;s jersey, with the summit finish up to Nongla finally giving the GC contenders present in China the chance to show off their end-of-season form.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAfter the mass crash early on stage 3, a notably smaller peloton lined up in Bama to take on the 176.8km stage to Jinchengjiang. Six riders abandoned during Thursday‚Äôs stage and three didn‚Äôt start on Friday, which left 119 riders in the peloton when the flag dropped on National Rd to signal the start of racing.</p>\n<p>What lay ahead was 176.8km with 2,140m of vertical ascent, the most climbing in any one day on the tour but with the final categorised climb topping out at around 35km to go, the crucial GC day is still expected to be on the summit finish of stage 5 on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The first challenge was the category 2 climb at 13.4km into the day of racing, followed by a cat 3 at 45.5km and another at 91.6km before the final category 2 challenge at 141.8km.</p>\n<p>The first three days may have been bunch sprints but it&#8217;s been close enough that the break was keen to give it another shot, especially with the lumpy profile.</p>\n<p>The race had barely got underway when the attacks came and the break, heavy on repeat offenders, quickly established. Stan Dewulf (Decathlon AG2R la Mondiale), Stefan Bissegger (EF Education-EasyPost), Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√©-Wanty) and Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-QuickStep) were the riders out the front.</p>\n<p>There was also something other than the stage at stake for Reinderink, with the Soudal-Quickstep rider second to Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) in the King of the Mountains classification when the day started.</p>\n<p>Reinderink captured the top points at the first KOM at 13.4km and then also the next at 45.5km into the race, ejecting De Bondt from the top spot in the virtual KOM standings.</p>\n<p>The next lot of points on the category 3 climb halfway through the stage again went to Reinderink, with the break of four continuing to hold a gap of a little more than two minutes to the peloton, where the Israel-Premier Tech team of the overall leader Vernon were working on the front to keep the break in check. Vernon may be in red for the squad now, but ultimately their plan for him has already been achieved, a stage win, while the GC plan lie with young star Joe Blackmore.</p>\n<p>Through the final categorised climb, Bisseger fell away from the lead group and riders also began to fall away from the back of the peloton as the pressure went on at the front.</p>\n<p>Bahrain Victorious rider Robert Stannard went on the attack from the peloton as ahead Reinderink added yet another lot of top points to his ever more impressive KOM tally. Stannard was quickly reeled back in but as this was playing out the gap between the leaders and the bunch was also being rapidly cut, having fallen well below a minute at 30km to go.</p>\n<p>Van der Hoorn quickly began to fade in the final phase of racing, leaving just Dewulf and Reinderink to try and survive. The pair made it to the final intermediate sprint where Dewulf netted three more bonus seconds to take his day&#8217;s total to six, which moved him narrowly into the virtual race lead.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates and Bahrain-Victorious did much of the work behind as the peloton melted away the break&#8217;s advantage and began to wind up for the final sprint in Jinchengjiang, with Dewulf and Reinderink finally being reabsorbed with 2km to go.</p>\n<p>On the wide final kilometre road, Visma-Lease a Bike were the best positioned until they got washed away and overtaken on both sides by several lead-out trains eyeing up the line, with Stewart piloting Vernon perfectly through the wheels with 400 metres to go.</p>\n<p>Vernon then launched confidently in the red jersey at the perfect moment and showed great strength to easily hold off Kanter and Bruttomesso, who had started to come up quickly on either side of him.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&amp;y=2024&amp;s=4&amp;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"yes\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&amp;y=2024&amp;s=4&amp;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Ethan Vernon (Israel-Premier Tech) won stage 3 of the Gree-Tour of Guangxi, claiming the crash-interrupted day of racing after it ultimately came down to another tight sprint.</p>\n<p>The British rider charged toward the line wheel-to-wheel with Juan Sebastian Molano (UAE Team Emirates), who had to settle for a close-run second. Israel-Premier Tech also took third with Riley Pickrell on the drama-filled day which was also the longest of the race. </p>\n<p>The mass crash that came within the first hour caused a temporary racing halt and also a number of abandons. The riders having to leave the race after the stage 3 crash included key favourite, Jhonatan Narv√°ez (Ineos Grenadiers) and last year‚Äôs winner, Milan Vader (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>Max Kanter (Astana Qazaqstan), who started the day in the red jersey of the leader, was also involved in the fall but was quickly back in the peloton and ultimately sprinted to eighth place. Still, that was not enough to see him hold the top spot. The stage win also put Vernon into the overall lead on the same time as Molano. Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), who swept up three more bonus seconds on the road during stage 3, sits in third overall at two seconds back.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe 214km day of racing in China took riders from Wednesday‚Äôs finishing point in Jingxi to Bama, via a route including three category 3 climbs. The last two came in quick succession after 150km of racing with the peak of the final categorised climb at 180km into the stage. That left a solid chunk of descending for the final 34km, however, it wasn‚Äôt all downhill. Some shorter climbs punctuated the closing stages as riders headed toward the false flat finish in the picturesque location, with the Panyang River, mountains and lush forests providing the backdrop. </p>\n<p>The question at the start was whether it would be a day for the sprinters or could the break finally make it to the end.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúAll things being equal it should come together for a sprint but as we have seen in the first two stages, the breakaway has almost made it so I think that is giving people a lot of hope,‚Äù Chris Froome (Israel-Premier Tech) said in a pre-stage interview posted on social media. He also, somewhat fortuitously, added that ‚Äúwe have got a few cards to play if it does come to a sprint, that‚Äôs for sure.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There were fewer riders setting off from Jingxi on Thursday, which was no surprise given that stage 2 included a crash in the final kilometre. Jasper Stuyven (Lidl-Trek), who was one of the victims, was a DNS but the in-doubt pre-race favourite Narv√°ez made it to the start line. Other non-starters were an unwell Emmanuel Buchmann (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Fabio Jakobsen (DSM-Firmenich PostNL), who finished nearly 15 minutes off the back of the main group on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt, however, the end of the attrition. After an attacking start, where a group of three and another trio of counter-attackers had established a small gap, a large crash occurred, pausing proceedings within the first 30km of racing. More than 20 riders were caught up, including race leader Kanter, though he had made his way back to the peloton when the temporary halt was called.</p>\n<p>Regardless, it delivered a major impact on the race with the riders who were out as a result including Vader who had an injured knee along with Narv√°ez, who after his second crash of the tour ended his time racing with Ineos Grenadiers prematurely. Vegard Stake Laengen (UAE Team Emirates) and Mikkel Honor√© (EF Education-EasyPost) also abandoned.</p>\n<p>Once the racing got underway again another break was established with De Bondt on the move for a second day, this time with Dutch rider Pepijn Reinderink (Soudal-Quickstep). The polka-dot jersey-clad Belgian swept up the top KOM points at 101km and also top sprint points at 137km, with Robert Stannard (Bahrain-Victorious) this time securing the remaining points ahead of the rest of the peloton.</p>\n<p>The pair also held firm out front for the KOM points at 161km into the day of racing, with De Bondt‚Äôs teammate Victor Lafay taking third spot after attacking from the peloton with Artem Shmidt (Ineos Grenadiers). With more ultimately unsuccessful attacks flying off the front of the peloton the gap which had been over three minutes, continued to fall. It had slipped under two minutes by the final KOM points of the day at 180km into the stage. De Bondt of course claimed top points there too. </p>\n<p>By the time the pair had hit the 13km to go mark the gap was around 20 seconds and Reinderink decided he‚Äôd see if his chances were better if he took off alone. No such luck, as while it gave him a little more time the Soudal-Quickstep rider was still swept up with just under 7km to go and the set up for the sprint began.</p>\n<p>The Israel-Premier Tech jerseys were prominent at the front in another spread-out sprint and while there was plenty of room across the road for the challengers to charge none could overcome Vernon, though Milano got ever so close only losing out to a bike throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Warre Vangheluwe (Soudal-Quickstep) won stage 2 of the Gree-Tour of Guangxi in Jingxi, delivering a long and powerful sprint to capture his first WorldTour victory. </p>\n<p>Another bunch sprint played out after the final six riders from the early break were swept up within the last kilometre. Soon after a crash in the middle of the peloton disrupted some just as they were winding up for the final acceleration on another wide finishing straight.</p>\n<p>Vangheluwe, however, had a clear run to the line and better speed, celebrating the second win of his career and his 2024 season.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI came to China with high expectations and it‚Äôs just incredible I got this victory,&#8221;  Vangheluwe said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My job was to lead out Luke Lamperti, but he got boxed in, and the moment the peloton caught Martin I launched my sprint and gave my all to finish it off. I am so happy with this victory.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Max Kanter (Astana-Qazaqstan) came off Vangheluwe&#8217;s wheel to take second while Jake Stewart (Israel-Premier Tech) secured third in the 182km second stage of the six-day WorldTour race in China.</p>\n<p>The second place for Kanter on the stage was also enough to put him in the red jersey of the race leader, on the same time as Gijs van Hoecke (Intermarch√©-Wanty) who was runner up on stage 1. </p>\n<p>Former race leader Lionel Taminiaux (Lotto-Dstny) was dropped from the peloton so slid down the standings to 105th place. </p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nTuesday‚Äôs stage 1 had played out as an archetypal sprint stage, with a two-person break that went early reeled in through the final kilometres, allowing the teams of the sprinters to deliver their contenders to the front so they could let the battle unfurl on the wide straight to the line in Fangchenggang. Taminiaux claimed the first tight-run sprint victory so lined up in Chongzuo with the red jersey of the race leader on his back.</p>\n<p>The riders faced 182km of racing on stage 2, with two category 3 climbs, the last peaking about 30km from the finish line. It would make the day more challenging for the sprinters and their teams to control the break.</p>\n<p>A breakaway group of eight soon formed at the front, including Chris Froome (Israel Premier Tech) Julien Vermote (Visma-Lease a Bike), Dries De Bondt (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Taco van der Hoorn (Intermarch√© &#8211; Wanty), Daan Hoole (Lidl-Trek), Thomas Champion (Cofidis), Filip Maciejuk (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Martin Svrƒçek (Soudal Quickstep). </p>\n<p>The gap was up to about three minutes after around 40km of racing and hovered thereabouts at the halfway mark.</p>\n<p>At the intermediate sprint at the 94.3km mark, De Bondt, Maciejuk and Vermote swept up the top three spots. </p>\n<p>The group held out the front, maintaining the gap at close to three minutes as they worked their way through the warm conditions, green landscape and waterfalls among the dramatic rock formations till they reached the final category 3 climb within 40km to go. </p>\n<p>Froome fell away from the lead group as De Bondt, Champion and Hoole claimed the KOM points at the top.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that the gap to the peloton began to drop rapidly and, with the pressure on, riders also began to fall out the back of the stretched out bunch, including the red jersey clad Taminiaux. </p>\n<p>Champion also fell away from the leaders so by the second intermediate sprint at around 12km to go there were six riders in the lead and the gap was slipping to under a minute. Maciejuk, De Bondt and Svrƒçek grabbed the points this time.</p>\n<p>At five kilometres to go the gap was just 30 seconds but the break stayed away until the very last kilometre, only being swept up as the positioning for the sprint unfolded. </p>\n<p>That last few hundred metres didn‚Äôt go to plan for some, however, with a crash in the middle of the road disrupting the final charge even with the wide roads of the finale ‚Äì though not forVangheluwe of course. </p>\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers said on social media that Jhonathan Narv√°ez (Ineos Grenadiers) ‚Äì who had come 11th on stage 1 and also grabbed a bonus second during the opening stage to set him in good standing among the key overall contenders ‚Äì had been among those caught out by the crash so couldn‚Äôt contest the sprint. Still when he crossed the line Narv√°ez was given the same time as the bunch, leaving him 12th overall and just five seconds back from red.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=2&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It will be the 5th edition of the Tour of Guangxi and the thirty-fifth and final event of the 2024 UCI World Tour.</p>\n<p>Lionel Taminiaux (Lotto-Dstny) opened the six-stage Gree-Tour of Guangxi with a victory, overcoming Gijs van Hoecke (Intermarch√©-Wanty) in a tight sprint to the line in Fangchenggang on stage 1.</p>\n<p>Taminiaux and Van Hoecke were neck and neck on opposite sides of the road during the final metres, with the Lotto-Dstny rider just managing to get the advantage when it counted so he could sweep up his first WorldTour win.</p>\n<p>A rapidly closing Juan Sebasti√°n Molano (UAE Team Emirates) took third, charging past the fourth-placed Ethan Vernon, who was tucked in behind Taminiaux.</p>\n<p>The opening stage of the final WorldTour race of 2024 played out over a course that was always expected to deliver a bunch sprint but still threw in some hills to test the field as it wound over the bridge-heavy circuit with no shortage of water views. </p>\n<p>The loop took riders out from Fangchenggang, heading out and back from the port city four times before crossing the line for the final time after 149.4km.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe six-stage tour, which finishes on Sunday October 20, boasts a strong field this year from Jhonathan Narv√°ez (Ineos Grenadiers), Pavel Sivakov (UAE Team Emirates), defending champion Milan Vader (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Luke Plapp (Jayco-AlUla) but it is Saturday‚Äôs stage 5 to Nongla that is expected to be the telling day for the general classification given the summit finish.</p>\n<p>Still, before racing got underway in Fangchenggang the key message was that despite the focus on Saturday, the overall contenders would have to be wary from day one as the hilly parcours through much of the race opened the door to surprises.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúStage 5 is of course for everyone the most difficult one and should be a classement day but to be honest, every day I think it is difficult to control for the sprinters&#8217; teams and there are not that many sprinters so I think we could see a more exciting race this year,‚Äù said Visma-Lease a Bike sports director Frans Maassen in an interview from before the stage start that was put out on the race social media.</p>\n<p>The sprinters&#8217; teams, however, managed to get the outcome they had been hoping for on the opening stage at least, with this day of racing at least sticking to the script.</p>\n<p>As the flag fell to get the race underway, with the start scheduled for the Zhenyuling Bridge, it wasn‚Äôt long before a break of two was established with Stan Dewulf (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) and Rune Herregodts (Intermarch√©-Wanty) stretching the gap. They swept up the first intermediate sprint points on the first pass of the line at 35.4km while Narv√°ez ‚Äì who is heading to UAE Team Emirates in 2025 ‚Äì snatched the final bonus second up for grabs.</p>\n<p>Dewulf and Herregodts maintained a gap of over two minutes through the next two laps, with the next batch of intermediate sprint points at 111.4km into the stage delivering a repeat of the top two positions but it was recently returned Robert Stannard (Bahrain Victorious) who took third this time, leaping from the group as they passed the line for the second last time.</p>\n<p>Then in the final lap, a spent Herregodts fell away and the peloton had pulled Dewulf within two minutes at around 20km to go. At just over 12km to go Herregodts was back in the peloton but Dewulf still held out front.</p>\n<p>The gap had dropped to less than a minute as they entered the final 10km but the Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rider gritted his teeth as he attempted to hold off the quickly approaching peloton on the wide straight roads. At 5km to go it was clear the break wasn‚Äôt going to prevail, but Dewulf was left hanging for a while before finally being swept up at 3km to go. </p>\n<p>After that, it was time for the sprint teams to prepare for the fast finale.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=7591&#038;y=2024&#038;s=1&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

It is part of the UCI Europe Tour and is rated by the UCI as a 2.1 event, the third tier of professional stage races and consisted of six stages over 916 km (569.2 mi).</p>\n<p>A well-timed late surge netted up-and-coming Danish rider Tobias Lund Andresen (Team dsm-firmenich PostNL) the victory on stage 4&#8217;s uphill finish of the 2024 CRO Race, while Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates) remained firmly in control overall with just two days of racing left to go.</p>\n<p>After Bahrain Victorious duo Fred Wright and Edoardo Zambanini raised the pace on the second, definitive assault on the cobbled cat 3 Labin climb, Lund Andresen zipped past in the last few metres of the ascent for the stage win.</p>\n<p>McNulty placed seventh behind the Team dsm-firmenich PostNL rider, a handful of seconds adrift as the front group of some 40 riders shattered.</p>\n<p>After the CRO Tour&#8217;s hardest stage of the 2024 edition, crossing the mighty Hors Categorie Poklon ascent, McNulty still leads 22 seconds ahead of Lund Andresen, with Zambanini in third.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I really didn&#8217;t expect this, the team put a lot of faith in me &#8211; I didn&#8217;t win today, it was my team,&#8221; Lund Andresen, clad in the white jersey of Best Young Rider, told the race organiser&#8217;s TV interviewer afterwards. </p>\n<p>&#8220;They paced me back up over the hardest climb of the day, I would never have been up there at the finish if it wasn&#8217;t for them.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;But I think physically this is the best moment of my life.

When you are a sprinter like me, you don&#8217;t feel the legs anymore, you just go for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Four riders took off in the first flat section of the 160.5 kilometre stage in a strong-looking move with Robert Stannard (Bahrain Victorious), Ryan Mullen (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Hugo Aznar (Kern Pharma), 2023 Giro d&#8217;Italia race leader Andreas Leknessund (Uno X Mobility) and Tim Marsman (Metec-SOLARWATT p/b Mantel). The five had a slowly shrinking gap of just over two minutes at the foot of the Polkon climb &#8211; the one Hors Categorie ascent of the 2024 race &#8211;  courtesy of the pressure applied behind by Polti-Kometa and UAE. That was when Leknessund opted to press on, shedding Marsman and Mullen from the break, while the peloton split into several large segments as a result of UAE&#8217;s hard work on the 11.7-kilometre climb.</p>\n<p>However, what UAE were likely not counting on was when multiple Kern Pharma riders attacked in quick succession, leaving McNulty isolated and forced to chase in person close to the mist-enshrouded, rainsoaked summit. Such was the intensity of the aggressive racing that by the top just seven riders remained with McNulty, only for Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers) to go missing from their number when he crashed heavily on a sharp righthander on the downhill.</p>\n<p>After a technical, fast descent into much drier conditions, race-wise there was bad news for breakaway trio Leknessund, Aznar and Stannard as McNulty, previously unsupported in the chase group, was reached by UAE teammate Igor Arrieta. As the race reached its third hour, Arrieta did nearly all the heavy lifting on the smoother, gentler lower downhill sections, and then after the mini-peloton swelled considerably in numbers, Stannard and Leknessund were finally reeled in 23 kilometres from the line.</p>\n<p>Late testing attacks began almost immediately on the short, constantly twisting finishing circuit, tackled twice, that followed. DSM and Kern Pharma were notably present in numbers on the front as the cobbled cat 3 Labin, the only summit finish of the 2024 race, approached. But in fact, it was Austrian National Champion Alexander Hajek (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) who started the late fireworks.</p>\n<p>McNulty was in fourth place near the front of the main group when the pack went across the summit of the Labin for the first time, keeping a close eye on the GC contenders. The American responded quickly as the tireless Castrillo then bounded past the stage leaders. However, he was less interested when Ben Turner (Ineos Grenadiers) accelerated away at 9.5 kilometres go, inching out his lead in a fiercely determined move. </p>\n<p>Turner&#8217;s courageous late attack was sucked in almost at the foot of the climb, leaving Ineos and DSM to boss the front. Clearly wanting to discourage late challenges, McNulty opened up the throttle in the last 200 metres, only for Bahrain to try a double move with Wright and Zambanini. However, they, too, were powerless to stop Lund Andresen from darting past their right-hand side to claim the sixth win in just two years as a professional.</p>\n<p>Lund Andresen was asked if he thought he could still overtake McNulty on GC in the two days of racing remaining, but he was not overly optimistic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s difficult to beat McNulty after what he did yesterday [stage 3], his win was really impressive, huge respect for him,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I think the win is out of the picture but at least the final podium is possible.

The 2024 Tour de Langkawi (officially Petronas Le Tour de Langkawi 2024 for sponsorship reasons) was the 28th edition of the Tour de Langkawi road cycling stage race, which is the part of the 2024 UCI ProSeries. It will begin on 29th of September in Kuah and will finish on 6th of October in Bintulu.</p>\n<p>Manuele Tarozzi  narrowly managed to fend off the sprinters on stage 6 of Le Tour de Langkawi to claim his VF Group Bardiani-CSF Faizan√© team&#8217;s ninth win of the season from a lengthy breakaway.</p>\n<p>The Italian allrounder saw off his only most persistent rival and fellow breakaway, Stefan de Bod (EF Education-EasyPost) to net the win by a small but sufficient margin of nine seconds on the peloton.</p>\n<p>&#8220;De Bod tried to attack at the red triangle, but then he went too early,&#8221; Tarozzi explained in a team press release. &#8220;while I launched the sprint 300 meters from the finish. It couldn&#8217;t have gone better today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Max Poole continues as race leader with two stages remaining, although the Team dsm-firmenich-PostNL climber&#8217;s advantage of 14 seconds over closest  overall pursuer Thomas Pesenti (JCL Team Ukyo) is a very narrow one. A further seven GC challengers are still only a little further back, at 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>After the two early time bonuses on the largely flat stage 6 from Batu Pahat to Kulai   were passed, a four-up breakaway formed, containing Tarozzi and VF Group-Bardiani CSF-Faizane teammate Davide Gabburo, De Bod and Valentin Darbellay (Corratec-Selle Italia).</p>\n<p>Despite Tudor ProCycling&#8217;s best efforts, riding for their double stage winner Arvid De Kleijn, two riders from the move of the day managed to keep the sprinters&#8217; teams at bay, with Tarozzi then smoothly going clear in the last few hundred metres to take the win.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We initially aimed for the general classification, but I had a bad day at Cameron Highlands. We also lost Lorenzo Conforti due to a crash, but Mattia Pinazzi showcased himself in the sprints, and the rest of us focused on breakaways,&#8221; Tarozzi said, dedicating the win to his wife Silvia.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to thank Davide Gabburo for his great help and our director Alessandro Donati, who pushed me to try again today.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=128&#038;y=2024&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=128&#038;y=2024&#038;s=6&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Poole and his companions were caught on the short descent to the finish, setting up a larger group sprint for the win.</p>\n<p>In the end, the 21-year-old second-year pro launched his sprint for the line early on the downhill run to steal a march on his rivals and score his first pro victory.</p>\n<p>He now leads the race by five seconds from L√≥pez, while Pesenti lies in third overall at six seconds back. With the remaining five stages of the race run largely over flat ground, Poole and DSM are in the driving seat for overall victory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was quite a straightforward day with how the parcours was, with a flat first 100km then uphill for the final 70km. It was really the only opportunity for the climbers here,&#8221; Poole said after the stage.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a really good group of people around me; we made a good plan and knew that it was being about patient and waiting until the last kilometre of the climb to make the damage. When there were attacks, I just tried to stay patient until the last moment to then make the difference and then come over the top of the climb with a gap. We worked well together as a trio but the group from behind came back.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There were a few teams with a couple of guys, so I just had to pick the right wheel and get a good run to the line. We knew the finish was slowly dragging uphill, but I got a good bit of slipstream and used it to launch early and held on to the finish. I&#8217;ve been sprinting quite well the past few months, so I had to back myself.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m super happy to get my first pro win and the guys did a great job today so thanks to them as well. We&#8217;ll approach each day as it comes, and we have some nice sprint opportunities with Casper so we will also focus on them too and try and go for another win there.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=128&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=128&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The Tour de Luxembourg is classified as a 2.Pro race, the highest rating below the World Tour, by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport&#8217;s governing body. In 2006, the Tour became part of the UCI Europe Tour, and became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates) won the stage 4 time trial at the Tour of Luxembourg, setting a time of 19:11 on the 15.5km course to beat Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious) to the victory by seven seconds.</p>\n<p>Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) signalled his form ahead of next week‚Äôs UCI Road World Championships road race as the Dane rounded out the podium in third place at 11 seconds down.</p>\n<p>The big news of the day, however, was another change in the leader‚Äôs jersey as stage 3 winner Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep) handed the overall lead back to stage 1 winner Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck).</p>\n<p>Van der Poel finished up fifth on the day, limiting his losses to Ayuso to 19 seconds, while Vansevenant finished down in 18th place, 54 seconds off the Spaniard.</p>\n<p>As a result, Van der Poel ‚Äì who is a week away from his world title defence ‚Äì is back in the race lead ahead of Sunday‚Äôs final stage, a hilly 177km run from Mersch to Luxembourg. He holds a three-second lead over Ayuso in second and Vansevenant in third. Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) lies in fourth at eight seconds, while Tiberi is in fifth at 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nWith three stages of racing over and done, and under 30 seconds separating 14 riders behind Vansevenant, the time trial in Differdange was always set to be a major GC flashpoint in the 2.Pro stage race.</p>\n<p>A flat start on the stage would give way to a 1.3km, 8.5% climb just before the mid-stage checkpoint, with the rest of the run back into Differdange run on rolling and flat roads.</p>\n<p>Few of the early starters pulled up any trees, with only one of the first 25 riders breaking the 20-minute barrier ‚Äì early hot seat holder Vincent Van Hemelen (Flanders-Baloise) at 19:51.</p>\n<p>The Belgian would be forced out of the provisional lead less than 10 minutes later as Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek), honing his form ahead of the Road World Championships, sped through with a time of 19:22 to go quickest.</p>\n<p>Lorenzo Milesi (Movistar) crossed the line minutes later to slot into second place, his time of 19:32 the closest to Pedersen‚Äôs for another half an hour before Felix Gro√üschartner (UAE Team Emirates) went one second quicker.</p>\n<p>Pedersen‚Äôs time stood firm at the top of the standings, however, as the likes of Quinn Simmons (Lidl-Trek) and Finn Fisher-Black (UAE Team Emirates) crossed the line with solid but non-threatening times of 19:37 and 19:44.</p>\n<p>Once the late runners, the GC contenders, were ready to go out and start their runs it was Ayuso, lying in 11th overall, who commanded attention as he sped through the first checkpoint in first place.</p>\n<p>His time of 12:19 was six seconds quicker than Pedersen and he duly converted that into the top time at the finish line to slot into provisional lead by 11 seconds. Those starting just after him ‚Äì including David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and Wilco Kelderman (Visma-Lease A Bike) ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt come close to Ayuso‚Äôs time, meaning he was immediately setting his eyes at the top of the GC.</p>\n<p>Tiberi set a solid time at the intermediate checkpoint, shedding nine seconds to Ayuso. Unlike others, however, he held his speed rather than fading over the second half and crossed the line with a deficit of seven seconds, good to go second on the stage.</p>\n<p>Podium sitters Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates), Van der Poel, and Vansevenant were last off, with the latter duo both putting in better rides than the race leader.</p>\n<p>Hirschi crossed the checkpoint seven seconds off Ayuso and ended up fourth at the finish, 15 seconds down, while Van der Poel started off stronger ‚Äì four seconds down ‚Äì before fading slightly to finish fifth, a further four seconds back.</p>\n<p>Vansevenant, meanwhile, was always set to lose the leader‚Äôs jersey. He was already 21 seconds down at the checkpoint and finished his day well out of contention at 54 seconds off Ayuso, ceding the lead after one day.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=4&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

In 2006, the Tour became part of the UCI Europe Tour, and became part of the UCI ProSeries in 2020.</p>\n<p>Mauri Vansevenant (Soudal-QuickStep) claimed a solo victory in the toughest stage of the Tour de Luxembourg, ousting Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) from the overall lead thanks to his late breakaway move.</p>\n<p>Looking repeatedly behind him in the technical finale in Diekirch, Vansevenant crossed the line 18 seconds ahead of closest pursuer Davide Formolo (Movistar), with a Van der Poel-led group blasting across the line at 41 seconds.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I already did the Vuelta a Espa√±a [this autumn] so I&#8217;m not feeling super-fresh, but when the engine is running it doesn&#8217;t stop anymore,&#8221; Vansevenant said afterwards.<br />\n&#8220;When I&#8217;m alone I can keep going. I knew I had some power left, but to win this way is really nice,&#8221; Vansevenant said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a feeling I was the engine of the two [with Formolo] and I wanted to be sure that I didn&#8217;t give it away, so I went full-full-full on the last climb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an ultra-hilly stage with nearly 4,000 metres of vertical climbing, Vansevenant made his winning attack four kilometres from the finish, shedding Formolo and moving ahead for his first victory since the toughest stage of the 2023 Tour of Oman.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel closed down multiple attacks, most notably by UAE Team Emirates Marc Hirschi, but with two stages remaining, Vansevenant has now opened a 34 gap overall on the leading favourite and the race remains wide open.</p>\n<p>On a great day, all around for Soudal-QuickStep, an early dig by Vansevenant&#8217;s teammate Louis Vervaeke and Johannes Kulset (Uno-X Mobility) proved more successful than expected, too, staying away for nearly 180 kilometres despite Vervaeke&#8217;s later reservations that he would have preferred a bigger break than one with just two riders to form. </p>\n<p>The duo&#8217;s gap nonetheless became so large at one point that Kulset, 6:13 down on Van der Poel on GC, briefly became provisional race leader on the road, even if the 20-year-old Norwegian did struggle notably on the brutally steep mid-stage Um Knupp climb.  </p>\n<p>Then when reinforcements in the shape of counter-attackers  Bastien Tronchon (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) and Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier arrived a little later, the quartet managed to maintain their advantage all the way to a difficult finishing circuit, tackled twice and featuring five classified climbs in just over 30 kilometres.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates&#8217; determination to work in the chasing bunch was quickly explained when Felix Gro√üschartner charged away on the initial ascent of three of the Mont√©e de Haemerich, catching the flagging foursome just after the first time across the finish line in the small town of Diekirch. </p>\n<p>The Austrian went straight to the head of the break, and Kulset immediately paid the price for the surge in pace, while stage 2 winner Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) followed suit in the crumbling bunch and dropped back as well. </p>\n<p>An acceleration by Andreas Kron (Lotto-Dstny) sparked yet more testing moves in the peloton and so many challenges forced a prematurely isolated race leader Van der Poel to start bridging gaps in person. </p>\n<p>In turn, Van der Poel&#8217;s repeated clampdowns caused a loose regrouping of some three dozen riders at the front of the race as it moved along a ridge road at speed. But even the in-form Dutch champion had too much on his hands to stop the ever-recognisable figure of Vansevenant from going clear with 24 kilometres to go, though, just before the second key climb, the punchy Seitert. And he was equally powerless when Formolo, often in form on home soil in the Italian autumn Classics, quickly joined Vansevenant. </p>\n<p>Formolo and Vansevenant were still hanging on as they crossed through the finish line for the second last time, but despite a gap of less than a minute on a very volatile chase group powered by UAE and Van der Poel, their collaboration was limited at best. Vansevenant repeatedly testing a flagging Formolo did not do him any favours with the Italian, either &#8211; at one point Formula patted the Belgian on the back with some ironic congratulations after he had been dropped yet again. That said, collaboration in the main pack, now almost a minute back, was crumbling too.</p>\n<p>The stage was long decided in favour of the two breakaways, but when Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) made a counter-move around eight kilometres from the finish, Van der Poel flashed across in no time at all, realising that a concerted chase was the only way to have any chance of winning overall. By steadying the ship and bringing home a group of 13 chasers for third and four potentially invaluable bonus seconds Van der Poel remains very much in contention &#8211; though dropping down to third overall means he has a fight on his hands for sure</p>\n<p>Ahead, meanwhile, Vansevenant&#8217;s last surge in speed at the foot of the Haemerich proved too much for Formolo and after clearing the top of the steep, wooded climb one last time, the Belgian climber picked his way carefully down the drop into the finishing town to claim the third victory of his career. The 25-year-old Soudal-QuickStep racer claimed the overall lead too, but although he seemed far from certain of his chances of keeping it in Saturday&#8217;s critical 15.5-kilometre time trial against such a formidable opponent as Van der Poel, he insisted he would not give it up without a fight come what may.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will go full for sure, but it&#8217;s not my specialty so I&#8217;m not sure I can keep the [leader&#8217;s] jersey,&#8221; Vansevenant recognised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our race mission is already completed, though, as now we have a stage victory and I am feeling very motivated. So I will try my best to defend it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I knew I had some power left, but to win this way is really nice,&#8221; Vansevenant said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had a feeling I was the engine of the two [with Formolo] and I wanted to be sure that I didn&#8217;t give it away, so I went full-full-full on the last climb.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an ultra-hilly stage with nearly 4,000 metres of vertical climbing, Vansevenant made his winning attack four kilometres from the finish, shedding Formolo and moving ahead for his first victory since the toughest stage of the 2023 Tour of Oman.</p>\n<p>Van der Poel closed down multiple attacks, most notably by UAE Team Emirates Marc Hirschi, but with two stages remaining, Vansevenant has now opened a 34 gap overall on the leading favourite and the race remains wide open.</p>\n<p>On a great day, all around for Soudal-QuickStep, an early dig by Vansevenant&#8217;s teammate Louis Vervaeke and Johannes Kulset (Uno-X Mobility) proved more successful than expected, too, staying away for nearly 180 kilometres despite Vervaeke&#8217;s later reservations that he would have preferred a bigger break than one with just two riders to form. </p>\n<p>The duo&#8217;s gap nonetheless became so large at one point that Kulset, 6:13 down on Van der Poel on GC, briefly became provisional race leader on the road, even if the 20-year-old Norwegian did struggle notably on the brutally steep mid-stage Um Knupp climb.  </p>\n<p>Then when reinforcements in the shape of counter-attackers  Bastien Tronchon (Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale) and Lidl-Trek&#8217;s Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier arrived a little later, the quartet managed to maintain their advantage all the way to a difficult finishing circuit, tackled twice and featuring five classified climbs in just over 30 kilometres.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates&#8217; determination to work in the chasing bunch was quickly explained when Felix Gro√üschartner charged away on the initial ascent of three of the Mont√©e de Haemerich, catching the flagging foursome just after the first time across the finish line in the small town of Diekirch. </p>\n<p>The Austrian went straight to the head of the break, and Kulset immediately paid the price for the surge in pace, while stage 2 winner Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) followed suit in the crumbling bunch and dropped back as well. </p>\n<p>An acceleration by Andreas Kron (Lotto-Dstny) sparked yet more testing moves in the peloton and so many challenges forced a prematurely isolated race leader Van der Poel to start bridging gaps in person. </p>\n<p>In turn, Van der Poel&#8217;s repeated clampdowns caused a loose regrouping of some three dozen riders at the front of the race as it moved along a ridge road at speed. But even the in-form Dutch champion had too much on his hands to stop the ever-recognisable figure of Vansevenant from going clear with 24 kilometres to go, though, just before the second key climb, the punchy Seitert. And he was equally powerless when Formolo, often in form on home soil in the Italian autumn Classics, quickly joined Vansevenant. </p>\n<p>Formolo and Vansevenant were still hanging on as they crossed through the finish line for the second last time, but despite a gap of less than a minute on a very volatile chase group powered by UAE and Van der Poel, their collaboration was limited at best. Vansevenant repeatedly testing a flagging Formolo did not do him any favours with the Italian, either &#8211; at one point Formula patted the Belgian on the back with some ironic congratulations after he had been dropped yet again. That said, collaboration in the main pack, now almost a minute back, was crumbling too.</p>\n<p>The stage was long decided in favour of the two breakaways, but when Marc Hirschi (UAE Team Emirates) made a counter-move around eight kilometres from the finish, Van der Poel flashed across in no time at all, realising that a concerted chase was the only way to have any chance of winning overall. By steadying the ship and bringing home a group of 13 chasers for third and four potentially invaluable bonus seconds Van der Poel remains very much in contention &#8211; though dropping down to third overall means he has a fight on his hands for sure</p>\n<p>Ahead, meanwhile, Vansevenant&#8217;s last surge in speed at the foot of the Haemerich proved too much for Formolo and after clearing the top of the steep, wooded climb one last time, the Belgian climber picked his way carefully down the drop into the finishing town to claim the third victory of his career. The 25-year-old Soudal-QuickStep racer claimed the overall lead too, but although he seemed far from certain of his chances of keeping it in Saturday&#8217;s critical 15.5-kilometre time trial against such a formidable opponent as Van der Poel, he insisted he would not give it up without a fight come what may.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I will go full for sure, but it&#8217;s not my specialty so I&#8217;m not sure I can keep the [leader&#8217;s] jersey,&#8221; Vansevenant recognised.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our race mission is already completed, though, as now we have a stage victory and I am feeling very motivated. So I will try my best to defend it.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=37&#038;y=2024&#038;s=3&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç won a fourth Vuelta a Espa√±a title on Sunday evening, sealing his fifth Grand Tour title in six years with a second-place finish in the final stage time trial in Madrid.</p>\n<p>After claiming victory in Stage 4 at Pico Villuerca and taking the leader‚Äôs jersey, Rogliƒç and his Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe team nearly lost their grip on the Vuelta when Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) broke away solo, gaining an almost five-minute lead to take over the top of the GC standings. </p>\n<p>Rogliƒç steadily reduced the gap, picking up seconds along the way, and by his third stage win on Stage 19, he had regained the overall lead. Rogliƒç‚Äôs victory offered once again a sense of redemption after a major disappointment earlier in the season, coming after he withdrew from the Tour de France due to injuries sustained in a crash.</p>\n<p>One of only two riders to break the 27-minute barrier, Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) won the final time trial with a blistering time of 26:28 on the 24.6km course. It marked the Swiss rider&#8217;s first-ever stage victory in a Grand Tour after a string of second places in recent years.  </p>\n<p>Second on the stage, Rogliƒç was 31 seconds off the fastest time while Mattia Cattaneo (T-Rex QuickStep) claimed third, 42 seconds down. </p>\n<p>In the fiercely contested fight for the podium, Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) came out strong, defending his second-place position and realising his dream of a Grand Tour podium. Enric Mas (Movistar) secured third place, adding to his record of three runner-up finishes at the Vuelta.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s amazing, finally, I‚Äôve been fighting for it for a very long time, and I really wanted that win today. I knew with the parcours you had to go out hard and just keep it together until the end, and that‚Äôs what I did,&#8221; K√ºng said. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúI suffered a lot today, but I think everyone at the end of this hard Vuelta and I&#8217;m just so happy that I got this win here at the Vuelta. My first grand tour stage win and it&#8217;s been a long time in the making.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt&#8217;s always nice if you win with more than half a minute. It shows that you were absolutely the best, there was no coincidence today.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe final time trial, held on a fast and flat 24.6 course in Madrid, concluded with an up and down the Castellana before turning at the Plaza de Cibeles and heading up towards the finish line on the Gran V√≠a. Two intermediate checkpoints, at 7.9km and 16.8km, roughly divided the course into thirds.</p>\n<p>As the last rider on GC, Tim Naberman (DSM-Firmenich PostNL) was the first rider down the start ramp but the Dutch rider was caught by Thibault Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels) who went straight into a hot seat with an opening time of 27:43.</p>\n<p>The next fast time of 27:34 was set by Italian TT specialist Edoardo Affini (Visma-Lease a Bike), who chose to use a double-disc setup and though he was buffeted by wind on the course, he managed to hold his speed but was soon replaced on top of the leaderboard by former hour record holder and future teammate Victor Campenaerts (Lotto Dstny) who finished with a time of 27:22.</p>\n<p>In the final Grand Tour stages of their career, Thomas De Gendt (Lotto Dstny) kept his head down keeping his speed up until the finish while Robert Gesink (Visma-Lease A Bike) waved at his team car and the fans that lined the course.</p>\n<p>The fastest so far at the checkpoints, as the time edged closer to the 27-minute mark, Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) unseated the Belgian from the hot seat with a time of 27:14 but not for long, as Filippo Baroncini (UAE Team Emirates) flew in, two seconds faster than the Swiss rider.</p>\n<p>Winner on the opening time trial three weeks ago, American time trial champion Brandon McNulty (UAE Team Emirates) was over a minute down at the second checkpoint and slipped out of contention, seemingly due to a crash.</p>\n<p>All eyes were on the 97th rider to start and he did not disappoint as Stefan K√ºng (Groupama-FDJ) scorched the course, catching his minute-man, and increasing his 18-second advantage on the first check to 41 seconds by the second check, to 43 seconds at the finish line.</p>\n<p>After losing some speed on a corner, Mattia Cattaneo (T-Rex QuickStep) slotted into second place, 42 seconds from K√ºng, and one second faster than Baroncini with the GC contenders still to come.</p>\n<p>While K√ºng&#8217;s blazing time was tough to beat, the fight for the remaining podium spots was still wide open. Only nine seconds separated second-placed Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) from Enric Mas (Movistar). Meanwhile, Richard Carapaz (EF Education-Easy Post), sitting in fourth, gave everything to close his 49-second gap and secure a podium finish.</p>\n<p>In the battle for top 10 placings, Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek) took 1:13 out of David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and moved up to fifth place overall, as well as winning the best young rider classification.</p>\n<p>Race leader Rogliƒç posted the fastest time of all GC contenders at the first checkpoint, 13 seconds off of K√ºng‚Äôs time, and three seconds faster than O‚ÄôConnor. Though O‚ÄôConnor faded in the final half of the stage, he held on to his second place overall with a time of 27:33, 28 seconds faster than Mas. Carapaz finished with a solid time of 28:01 to seal fourth place.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=21&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Final General Classification : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

I always imagined winning on top of a climb, whether it was from a breakaway or the GC group, and I just felt good that second part today and I backed myself on that climb. This one definitely feels a bit sweeter,‚Äù said Dunbar after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm 12 minutes down on GC, I knew I‚Äôd get a bit of leeway, I think they gave me that,  but I‚Äôm just super happy that I could hold on today. Moments like this don‚Äôt come around too often. I‚Äôve had two of them now in the last two weeks and I‚Äôm just looking forward to sharing these moments with friends and family.‚Äù</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nAs the 2024 Vuelta a Espa√±a departed for its final road stage and final day in the mountains, there was tension right from the start, knowing that a brutal 172km of climbing with over 5000m of elevation gain awaited on one of the hardest Grand Tour stages of the season.</p>\n<p>Kasper Asgreen (T-Rex Quick-Step) got the attacks going from the flag drop, highlighting Mikel Landa‚Äôs intentions to rise up the GC after losing significant time on stage 18. However, with the roads heading uphill straight away, it wouldn‚Äôt be the Dane who made the difference.</p>\n<p>The strongest climbers who have characterised much of this Vuelta‚Äôs breakaways again rose to the top, forming a group of 11 over the category 3 ascent to Las Estacas de Trueba (9.2 km √† 3%): Jay Vine, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), Cl√©ment Berthet (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), Harold Tejada (Astana Qazaqstan), Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto Dstny), Carlos Canal (Movistar) Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Enzo Leijnse (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL), Thomas Champion (Cofidis) and Pablo Castrillo (Kern Pharma),</p>\n<p>This ended up being a group of 10 for the day when Leijnse dropped back to try and help Max Poole bridge the gap, however, this failed and both were swallowed up by the chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates dominated the fight for KOM points in the break as the seven categorised climbs came thick and fast en route to Pic√≥n Blanco, with Vine and Soler swapping who would get the maximum haul over the initial five ascents. This left them equal on 76 points heading into the final two cat. 1 climbs.</p>\n<p>Behind, while the gap was being kept tight by the T-Rex QuickStep-led peloton working for Landa, the biggest action was the reduction in strength of Rogliƒç‚Äôs team. 24 hours ago they were showing off their superiority up the climb to Moncalvillo, however, now they were falling away with rumoured illness, both climbers Aleksandr Vlasov and Dani Mart√≠nez dropping early and abandoning the race, before Nico Denz followed suit and left Rogliƒç isolated.</p>\n<p>Despite attacking in typical Marc Soler fashion throughout the opening 130km, the never-say-die Spaniard finally ended his effort with 36.5km to go on the penultimate climb to Puerto de Los Tornos, leaving Vine with Berthet as the strongest break riders to go off and try to confirm his lead in the KOM classification.</p>\n<p>But the action was still bubbling over behind for Quick-Step, who put Cattaneo on the front to do a huge pull in aid of Landa‚Äôs GC aims, which at points separated the group of favourites, however, ultimately left Landa struggling when his attack didn‚Äôt work inside the final 30km.</p>\n<p>This acceleration swept up the two remaining break riders but not many of the leaders still in the group had any teammates to do the pacing. This helped Vine, who was able to mop up two points at the KOM sprint behind his teammate Pavel Sivakov, who attacked away solo, Mas and one of Rogliƒç‚Äôs teammates Adria.</p>\n<p>Sivakov had a narrow lead for much of the climb after attacking away but built this out to over a minute in the descent and approach to the foot of the final, hellish climb to Pic√≥n Blanco &#8211; a 7.9km ascent averaging 9.1% with maximum gradients reaching 18%.</p>\n<p>As the rumours continued to swirl on what had happened to Rogliƒç‚Äôs troops, Adria and Lipowitz proved themselves to again be invaluable as they hit the front for their leader with 7km to go and started to wind up the mountain lead-out.</p>\n<p>They left it up to the imperious Slovenian with 6.2km to go, as Rogliƒç began tapping away on the 16% sections without a full attack by any means. Sivakov‚Äôs lead melted away to 40 seconds under the controlled pace on Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>Without Rogliƒç fully attacking, Dunbar took his chances and set off in pursuit of Sivakov in front, being allowed to get away with 5km due to starting the day way down on GC some 13:31 minutes off the lead.</p>\n<p>The Irishman quickly swept up the UAE rider and took the lead as the likes of David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and stage winner Urko Berrade (Kern Pharma) tried to attack away from the hesitant GC group.</p>\n<p>This hesitation would last until the final kilometre, when Dunbar went into and emerged from a cloud atop the climb with a 10-second lead still intact and just the final few corners to navigate.</p>\n<p>He didn‚Äôt falter and kept his effort with gritted teeth right through to the finish line for victory, as Mas finally got a small gap behind and beat Rogliƒç by three seconds, eventually gaining five on his rival at the line thanks to bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>But Rogliƒç had stayed calm and rode the climb in total control, even without the full outfit or Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe teammates, holding onto a lead of over two minutes on both O‚ÄôConnor, who held onto second, and Mas, heading into the final stage time trial tomorrow in Madrid.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

However, with the roads heading uphill straight away, it wouldn‚Äôt be the Dane who made the difference.</p>\n<p>The strongest climbers who have characterised much of this Vuelta‚Äôs breakaways again rose to the top, forming a group of 11 over the category 3 ascent to Las Estacas de Trueba (9.2 km √† 3%): Jay Vine, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), Cl√©ment Berthet (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), Harold Tejada (Astana Qazaqstan), Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto Dstny), Carlos Canal (Movistar) Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Enzo Leijnse (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL), Thomas Champion (Cofidis) and Pablo Castrillo (Kern Pharma),</p>\n<p>This ended up being a group of 10 for the day when Leijnse dropped back to try and help Max Poole bridge the gap, however, this failed and both were swallowed up by the chasing peloton.</p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates dominated the fight for KOM points in the break as the seven categorised climbs came thick and fast en route to Pic√≥n Blanco, with Vine and Soler swapping who would get the maximum haul over the initial five ascents. This left them equal on 76 points heading into the final two cat. 1 climbs.</p>\n<p>Behind, while the gap was being kept tight by the T-Rex QuickStep-led peloton working for Landa, the biggest action was the reduction in strength of Rogliƒç‚Äôs team. 24 hours ago they were showing off their superiority up the climb to Moncalvillo, however, now they were falling away with rumoured illness, both climbers Aleksandr Vlasov and Dani Mart√≠nez dropping early and abandoning the race, before Nico Denz followed suit and left Rogliƒç isolated.</p>\n<p>Despite attacking in typical Marc Soler fashion throughout the opening 130km, the never-say-die Spaniard finally ended his effort with 36.5km to go on the penultimate climb to Puerto de Los Tornos, leaving Vine with Berthet as the strongest break riders to go off and try to confirm his lead in the KOM classification.</p>\n<p>But the action was still bubbling over behind for Quick-Step, who put Cattaneo on the front to do a huge pull in aid of Landa‚Äôs GC aims, which at points separated the group of favourites, however, ultimately left Landa struggling when his attack didn‚Äôt work inside the final 30km.</p>\n<p>This acceleration swept up the two remaining break riders but not many of the leaders still in the group had any teammates to do the pacing. This helped Vine, who was able to mop up two points at the KOM sprint behind his teammate Pavel Sivakov, who attacked away solo, Mas and one of Rogliƒç‚Äôs teammates Adria.</p>\n<p>Sivakov had a narrow lead for much of the climb after attacking away but built this out to over a minute in the descent and approach to the foot of the final, hellish climb to Pic√≥n Blanco &#8211; a 7.9km ascent averaging 9.1% with maximum gradients reaching 18%.</p>\n<p>As the rumours continued to swirl on what had happened to Rogliƒç‚Äôs troops, Adria and Lipowitz proved themselves to again be invaluable as they hit the front for their leader with 7km to go and started to wind up the mountain lead-out.</p>\n<p>They left it up to the imperious Slovenian with 6.2km to go, as Rogliƒç began tapping away on the 16% sections without a full attack by any means. Sivakov‚Äôs lead melted away to 40 seconds under the controlled pace on Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>Without Rogliƒç fully attacking, Dunbar took his chances and set off in pursuit of Sivakov in front, being allowed to get away with 5km due to starting the day way down on GC some 13:31 minutes off the lead.</p>\n<p>The Irishman quickly swept up the UAE rider and took the lead as the likes of David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) and stage winner Urko Berrade (Kern Pharma) tried to attack away from the hesitant GC group.</p>\n<p>This hesitation would last until the final kilometre, when Dunbar went into and emerged from a cloud atop the climb with a 10-second lead still intact and just the final few corners to navigate.</p>\n<p>He didn‚Äôt falter and kept his effort with gritted teeth right through to the finish line for victory, as Mas finally got a small gap behind and beat Rogliƒç by three seconds, eventually gaining five on his rival at the line thanks to bonus seconds.</p>\n<p>But Rogliƒç had stayed calm and rode the climb in total control, even without the full outfit or Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe teammates, holding onto a lead of over two minutes on both O‚ÄôConnor, who held onto second, and Mas, heading into the final stage time trial tomorrow in Madrid.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=20&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) made his decisive move in the race for the overall Vuelta a Espa√±a on stage 19 as he took solo victory on the summit finish of Alto de Moncalvillo and moved into race lead.</p>\n<p>On the early slopes of Alto de Moncalvillo, the three-time champion was ferried ahead of the leading group by teammates Dan√≠ Martinez and Aleksandr Vlasov before riding clear of his Red Bull train just inside 5km to go.</p>\n<p>Enric Mas (Movistar) was the only rider able to make any reaction, leaving behind a group of GC favourites to bridge part of the way back to Rogliƒç and gained a 30-second advantage on the red jersey Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon‚ÄìAG2R La Mondiale).</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Connor could only watch as his 13-day red jersey streak and GC lead disappeared, but he battled to remain within two minutes of the Slovenian rider.</p>\n<p>Mas was stung by the steep inclines of the final slopes of Alto de Moncalvillo and was passed by David Gaudu (Groupama‚ÄìFDJ), who swept in ahead of him for second place. Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl‚ÄìTrek) also got the better of Mas in the last 100 metres to take third, 46 seconds behind Rogliƒç, while Mas trailed in four seconds later.</p>\n<p>O‚ÄôConnor finished 1:49 behind Rogliƒç, losing his red jersey but holding onto second place &#8211; 1:54 behind the new race leader, and 26 seconds ahead of Mas in third place. </p>\n<p>Speaking after the stage finish, stage winner Rogliƒç reflected on the day&#8217;s racing. &#8220;I had some really nice memories from this climb. It didn&#8217;t disappoint me again ‚Äì beautiful.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While many expected Rogliƒç to take victory today, the new red jersey argued it was never in the plan. &#8220;I said I don&#8217;t need the stage but I will not say their names but some guys decided we don&#8217;t listen to you anyway, we pull. We have nothing else to do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had to make a call and I say, OK, we have to all be on the same side, then we go for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked if he felt he had sealed his GC victory, Rogliƒç was cautious.&#8221;Not really. I mean, we say all the time &#8216;the Queen stage to come&#8217;, it&#8217;s the last one tomorrow, the big one, it is definitely super hard, and then still we don&#8217;t do the normal laps in Madrid ‚Äì it&#8217;s again a decisive day for the GC, time trial.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m far from done.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly O&#8217;Connor cut a despondent figure at the race finish. &#8220;I was a bit broken at the end there, I actually felt pretty good until the halfway,&#8221; the Australian said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s just stage 19 I guess.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking about the startling attack from the three Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe riders, he said, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t surprised, but I didn&#8217;t expect myself to be so bad at the end. A bit average to be honest but that&#8217;s the reality.&#8221;</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Connor accepted there were two testing days ahead, and that his thoughts were focused on the race finish, &#8220;Monday, having beers, sitting on the terrace and relaxing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nThe peloton set off from Logro√±o below a bright cloudy sky and against the striking pastoral landscapes of Bilbao, with the Rioja wine region on the day&#8217;s itinerary of sights.</p>\n<p>The 139 riders remaining in La Vuelta a Espa√±a peloton were soon leaping into attacks, with Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Dstny) an endearing (albeit predictable) protagonist of the early breakaway attempts.</p>\n<p>With 23km passed, a group of 23 attempted to break free, but a roaring 50kph peloton absorbed the attack quickly.</p>\n<p>Around the 30km mark, Edward Planckaert (Alpecin Deceuninck), Fran Miholjevic (Bahrain Victorious) and Vito Braet (Intermarch√©-Wanty) managed to establish a gap, with Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) and Simone Petilli (Intermarch√©-Wanty) successfully bridging across to them.</p>\n<p>With 125km left, the five riders had a gap of 1:20 and it seemed that the day&#8217;s main breakaway was formed.</p>\n<p>The peloton seemed quickly resigned to the five escapees, and it took only 15 minutes for that gap to swell to four minutes.</p>\n<p>Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale and Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe were active at the front of the peloton controlling the pace through the 100km market and toward the category 3 climb of Puerto de Pradilla that sat almost completely centrally on the stage profile.</p>\n<p>The break held, but the efforts of Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe on the long ascent chipped into their advantage as the five riders passed the summit of the Puerto de Pradilla with a slimmer margin of 2:40 on the peloton.</p>\n<p>Aside from a brief split and a tussle of peloton firepower between Movistar, Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe and Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale, the main group was largely orderly as it approached the final 40km.</p>\n<p>With 35km remaining, the break had only 1:30, with the 1,490m summit finish of Alto de Moncalvillo looming on the horizon.</p>\n<p>It was a margin that the riders held at the 25km mark, but the aggressive turn of pace that foreshadowed the final ascent &#8211; beginning with 8.6km to go &#8211; saw their gap shrink to 30 seconds with 12km remaining before they were swallowed up only kilometres from the foothills of the climb.</p>\n<p>As the ascent began, so too did the selection with all but the major GC contenders spat out of the main group as Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe set a blistering pace on the early kilometres of the climb.</p>\n<p>With 5.8km left of the ascent, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç was catapulted ahead of the favourites group by Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe henchmen Dan√≠ Martinez and Aleksandr Vlasov.

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Urko Berrade (Equipo Kern Pharma) secured his first professional victory on stage 18 at the Vuelta a Espa√±a. </p>\n<p>The Spaniard broke away from what was left of an original 42-rider breakaway on the final climb located 6km from the finish and then crossed the line four seconds ahead of the chase-group sprint won by Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) and teammate Pau Miquel (Equipo Kern Pharma) in Maestu-Parque Natural de Izki.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; Berrade said, when asked if this victory was a strategy to become famous in the international racing scene. &#8220;At the beginning of the Vuelta, our manager told me that I had to become famous. I said that It&#8217;s difficult for me, because I&#8217;m not a big media guy, but I think with this victory, maybe I have a chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On a day that put pressure on red jersey Ben O&#8217;Connor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), he managed to maintain his overall lead by five seconds ahead of runner-up Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and 1:25 ahead of third-place Enric Mas (Movistar) and 1:46 ahead of fourth-place Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>In what was a major change in the overall classification, Mikel Landa (T Rex Quick-Step) was distanced from the group of GC favourites over the day&#8217;s category 1 climb, Puerto Herrera. He finished the day 10 minutes behind the stage winner and 4:20 behind the GC group, slipping to 10th place overall now at 5:38 behind O&#8217;Connor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I had absolutely no idea,&#8221; said O&#8217;Connor when asked if he had anticipated the attacks from Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) on the slopes of the Puerto Herrera, who saw himself struggle to hold the gap and that had distanced Landa.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, it was to the benefit of all of us in front, but it was not easy. You could see how fast we were riding; it was full. It wasn&#8217;t an easy stage at all, to be honest, but there have been no easy days at the Vuelta a Espa√±a this year.</p>\n<p>Asked if the tough racing will have an impact on the final stages, O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;Probably not. We&#8217;ve raced every single day and everyone is just tired. Somehow, I&#8217;m still managing to crack out some pretty good numbers. I don&#8217;t think it makes any difference now. I&#8217;m still in the lead and it&#8217;s nice to have it for another day.

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Urko Berrade (Equipo Kern Pharma) secured his first professional victory on stage 18 at the Vuelta a Espa√±a. </p>\n<p>The Spaniard broke away from what was left of an original 42-rider breakaway on the final climb located 6km from the finish and then crossed the line four seconds ahead of the chase-group sprint won by Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) and teammate Pau Miquel (Equipo Kern Pharma) in Maestu-Parque Natural de Izki.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; Berrade said, when asked if this victory was a strategy to become famous in the international racing scene. &#8220;At the beginning of the Vuelta, our manager told me that I had to become famous. I said that It&#8217;s difficult for me, because I&#8217;m not a big media guy, but I think with this victory, maybe I have a chance.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On a day that put pressure on red jersey Ben O&#8217;Connor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale), he managed to maintain his overall lead by five seconds ahead of runner-up Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and 1:25 ahead of third-place Enric Mas (Movistar) and 1:46 ahead of fourth-place Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost).</p>\n<p>In what was a major change in the overall classification, Mikel Landa (T Rex Quick-Step) was distanced from the group of GC favourites over the day&#8217;s category 1 climb, Puerto Herrera. He finished the day 10 minutes behind the stage winner and 4:20 behind the GC group, slipping to 10th place overall now at 5:38 behind O&#8217;Connor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;No, I had absolutely no idea,&#8221; said O&#8217;Connor when asked if he had anticipated the attacks from Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) on the slopes of the Puerto Herrera, who saw himself struggle to hold the gap and that had distanced Landa.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the end, it was to the benefit of all of us in front, but it was not easy. You could see how fast we were riding; it was full. It wasn&#8217;t an easy stage at all, to be honest, but there have been no easy days at the Vuelta a Espa√±a this year.</p>\n<p>Asked if the tough racing will have an impact on the final stages, O&#8217;Connor said. &#8220;Probably not. We&#8217;ve raced every single day and everyone is just tired. Somehow, I&#8217;m still managing to crack out some pretty good numbers. I don&#8217;t think it makes any difference now. I&#8217;m still in the lead and it&#8217;s nice to have it for another day.

He was expected to travel home to Belgium but the consequences on his injuries are still unclear.</p>\n<p>The stage started fast as riders made early attacks but Alpecin-Deceuninck carefully controlled who could and who could not go up the road.</p>\n<p>Jonas Gregaard (Lotto-Dstny), Thibault Guernalec (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Thomas Champion (Cofidis) and Xabier Isasa (Euskaltel-Euskadi) got away and the peloton was happy for a quartet to stay out front. Other riders were quickly closed down but they opened a gap of 1:00 on the flat roads, with 125 km to race. The stage became a cat-and-mouse day in the saddle for everyone.</p>\n<p>The quartet opened their lead to 3:25 with 115 km to race but then started the climbs. Kern Pharma and DSM lead the peloton, doing favour to race leader O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs Decathlon AG2R team and the other sprinters‚Äô teams.</p>\n<p>The 8.7km Alto de la Estranguada climb came first after 55km and hurt Champion and Isasa. They got back on the descent and survived the second-category Alto del Caracol at the 70km point.</p>\n<p>The break and the peloton took the long and wet descent cautiously, with many teams in the peloton pacing their effort to ensure their sprinters survived and were fresh for the finish.</p>\n<p>The break held a gap of 4:10 with 50km but then the peloton upped the pace as the sprinter‚Äôs sensed their opportunity. Alpecin-Deceuninck and DSM-firmenich PostNL lead the chase for Groves and Bittner respectively. Kern Pharma also helped out.</p>\n<p>The increased speed meant the third hour of the stage was raced at 47 kph.</p>\n<p>Gregaard led the attackers through the intermediate sprint with 25km to go. Their gap was down to 1:30 but they bravely refused to give up, working together to stay away.</p>\n<p>The breakaway used the wet conditions to take more risks than the peloton and so kept their lead, losing just seven seconds in five kilometres. The peloton was lined out in the chase but the tough conditions and rolling roads made it a painful pursuit match.</p>\n<p>A surge in the attack saw Champion dropped but the peloton still struggled to close the gap. It was still 30 seconds with eight kilometres to race as the depleted and fatigued third-week peloton lacked the numbers and speed of the first week.</p>\n<p>The GC contenders moved to the front to stay safe before the five-kilometre mark, after which times would be taken in the event of a crash.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck packed near the front but could not control the race. Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) and Max Poole (DSM-firmenich PostNL) made a late attack to cross and pass the break. Campenaerts then joined them but the peloton was about to close the gap.</p>\n<p>The catch came late, in sight of the finish line but Groves and Alpecin-Deceuninck got the rewards for their hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

Kern Pharma and DSM lead the peloton, doing favour to race leader O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs Decathlon AG2R team and the other sprinters‚Äô teams.</p>\n<p>The 8.7km Alto de la Estranguada climb came first after 55km and hurt Champion and Isasa. They got back on the descent and survived the second-category Alto del Caracol at the 70km point.</p>\n<p>The break and the peloton took the long and wet descent cautiously, with many teams in the peloton pacing their effort to ensure their sprinters survived and were fresh for the finish.</p>\n<p>The break held a gap of 4:10 with 50km but then the peloton upped the pace as the sprinter‚Äôs sensed their opportunity. Alpecin-Deceuninck and DSM-firmenich PostNL lead the chase for Groves and Bittner respectively. Kern Pharma also helped out.</p>\n<p>The increased speed meant the third hour of the stage was raced at 47 kph.</p>\n<p>Gregaard led the attackers through the intermediate sprint with 25km to go. Their gap was down to 1:30 but they bravely refused to give up, working together to stay away.</p>\n<p>The breakaway used the wet conditions to take more risks than the peloton and so kept their lead, losing just seven seconds in five kilometres. The peloton was lined out in the chase but the tough conditions and rolling roads made it a painful pursuit match.</p>\n<p>A surge in the attack saw Champion dropped but the peloton still struggled to close the gap. It was still 30 seconds with eight kilometres to race as the depleted and fatigued third-week peloton lacked the numbers and speed of the first week.</p>\n<p>The GC contenders moved to the front to stay safe before the five-kilometre mark, after which times would be taken in the event of a crash.</p>\n<p>Alpecin-Deceuninck packed near the front but could not control the race. Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla) and Max Poole (DSM-firmenich PostNL) made a late attack to cross and pass the break. Campenaerts then joined them but the peloton was about to close the gap.</p>\n<p>The catch came late, in sight of the finish line but Groves and Alpecin-Deceuninck got the rewards for their hard work.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=17&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates) finally won a stage at the 2024 Vuelta a Espa√±a, with another aggressive and audacious attack on the climb to Lagos de Covadonga.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard was part of the 17-rider breakaway and then surged away on the steepest part of the 122km climb on stage 16. He distanced Filippo Zana (Jayco-AlUla) and Max Poole (DSM-Firmenich PostNL) in the final seven kilometres and then dived down the rain-soaked, misty descent to the finish line. Zana was second at 18 seconds, with Poole again the bridesmaid and third at 23 seconds.</p>\n<p>Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was part of the attack but sadly crashed out, suffering a knee injury.</p>\n<p>Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale ) again had to fight to keep the red leader‚Äôs jersey but lived to fight another day by just five seconds.</p>\n<p>The GC contenders marked each carefully until the final seven kilometres, when Mikel Landa (T Rex-Quick-Step) attacked. Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), Enric Mas (Movistar), Richard Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost) and David Gaudu (Groupama-FDJ) joined him but O‚ÄôConnor was distanced.</p>\n<p>However, he refused to give up and fought for every second. The GC riders finished 3:54 down on Soler but O‚ÄôConnor finished less than a minute behind them. That left him in red, with a lead of just 5 seconds on Rogliƒç. Mas is third overall at 1:25, with Carapaz fourth at 1:46 and Landa fifth at 2:18.</p>\n<p>Soler had finished third on three different stages in the last week but finally landed his first victory since the 2022 Vuelta.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve attacked a lot but this time I was able to finish it off,‚Äù Soler said. ‚ÄúIt was a very, very high quality breakaway but I knew that if I got away, I had a chance. Max Poole followed me and the pace was high behind, but I did it.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThis is very special. I haven‚Äôt won a lot with this team and so after three years, to win at the Vuelta is special.‚Äù</p>\n<p>How it unfolded<br />\nThe steep climb to the finish at Lagos de Covadonga meant that stage 16 was always going to be a dramatic and aggressive day of racing in the Asturias region.</p>\n<p>Van Aert was involved in a crash even before the stage began in earnest and that only heightened the tension in the peloton. There was again a race within the race, with riders looking to go in the break of the day in the hope of escaping the control of the GC contenders.</p>\n<p>Astana&#8217;s Harold Tejada was the first to go off the front when the flag dropped for the start of the 181.5km stage. He was joined by Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious) and others but they were soon chased down.</p>\n<p>The elastic eventually snapped after a fast 35km of racing. Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) was one of the first to move and an interesting 17-rider attack soon formed. The peloton allowed them to open a two-minute gap.</p>\n<p>In the move were: Wout van Aert  (Visma-Lease a Bike), Isaac Del Toro, Jay Vine and Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), William Junior Lecerf  (T-Rex-Quick-Step), Marco Frigo and Matthew Riccitello (Israel-Premier Tech), Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto-Dstny), Darren Rafferty (EF Education-EasyPost), Oier Lazkano (Movistar), Fran Miholjevic (Bahrain Victorious), Felix Engelhardt and Filippo Zana (Jayco-AlUla), Simon Guglielmi (Ark√©a-B&#038;B Hotels), Max Poole and Martijn Tusveld (DSM-Firmenich PostNL) and Ion Izagirre (Cofidis).</p>\n<p>Riccitello was the best-placed rider in the break but an hour down on O‚ÄôConnor and so not a threat; the peloton soon let them open a gap and to fight for the stage victory. Other riders like Van Aert and Vine were in a tussle for the mountain‚Äôs jersey, while some were key domestiques and adventurers.</p>\n<p>O&#8217;Connor suffered a mechanical problem and briefly dropped off the rear of the peloton with 135 km to race but was quickly back, with his Decathlon AG2R team soon back leading the peloton.</p>\n<p>On the first climb of the day, the Mirador del Fito, the break led by a whopping 9:25. Van Aert took 10 points to lift his total to 56, with Vine on 52. He wanted the blue polka-dot jersey, as well as the green points jersey. On the descent Van Aert went clear and pushed on alone. He opened a 50-second lead, perhaps to try to stay away to the next climb, but eventually drafted back to the breakaway.</p>\n<p>The breakaway riders started the first-category Collada Llomena climb after 118km with a lead of 8:45 on the peloton.</p>\n<p>Behind the GC group came alive briefly on the Collada Llomena when Movistar upped the pace. Mas attacked with 58 km to go, Rogliƒç followed him and then Mikel Kanda also tried a move. It was a sign of what was to come on the climb to the finish.</p>\n<p>Late drama<br />\nVan Aert again won the sprint to score maximum mountain points at the summit of the Collada Llomena, to extend his lead in the mountains competition. Little did he know that just a few kilometres later, on a fast, damp and so dangerous downhill curve, he would crash hard and be out of the race.</p>\n<p>Engelhardt and Del Toro also went down, with the German riding on with a huge hole in his shorts. Van Aert managed to avoid them but rode into the rocky hillside at speed, hitting his right knee and other parts of body. He tried to ride on and then bend his knee but was clearly in too much pain. It was a tragic and sad moment for the Belgian, who has battled back from so many crashes and serious injuries.</p>\n<p>Up front, some riders had been dropped from the attack but at least 10 were still fighting for the stage victory. After the descent and confirmation that Van Aert had abandoned the Vuelta due to his injuries, the break was still 6:30 clear. It was almost time for the 12.2km, 7% Lagos de Covadonga climb.</p>\n<p>Vine rode for Del Toro and Soler before being distanced and switching his focus to the mountain points, then Frigo and Poole kicked away. Only six riders were left up front.</p>\n<p>Soler got back on and then even got away with 7km to go, using his power to fight the pull of gravity. Poole and Zana were left to chase together as the visibility reduced and the rain came down but had missed their chance. Soler was away and charging towards victory.</p>\n<p>The GC attacks began with five kilometres to go. Matteo Cattaneo set up Landa and then he surged away, hands on the drops in a show of pure Landismo. Mas soon reacted and Rogliƒç joined him, along with Gaudu and Carapaz. O‚ÄôConnor was suffering and suddenly couldn&#8217;t hold the wheel.</p>\n<p>Rogliƒç, Mas, Carapaz and Guadu soon dropped Landa and drove on, with Rogliƒç close to becoming virtual race leader, as O‚ÄôConnor lost more than a minute. Carapaz and Mas were happy to help drive the pace in the fight for the podium places in Madrid.</p>\n<p>Somehow, O‚ÄôConnor was able to fight back on the flat section near the edge of Lagos de Covadonga, reducing his gap to below a minute.</p>\n<p>His red jersey was hanging by a thread but he refused to give up. He drove to the line and stopped the clock 58 seconds down on Rogliƒç. He kept the race lead by just five seconds.</p>\n<p>Wednesday‚Äôs 17th stage to Santander is a chance for a breakaway or sprinters who can handle the mid-stage climbs. It gives O‚ÄôConnor a chance to recover and prepare for another battle to keep the red jersey.</p>\n<p>The odds are now against him but he is still in the fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=16&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Pablo Castrillo (Equipo Kern Pharma) scored his second mountain stage victory of the week at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, coming out on top in a two-up battle against Aleksandr Vlasov) at the end of a thrilling final kilometre up Cuitu Negru on stage 15.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard had gone solo from the breakaway 3km from the finish line and looked set for a second solo stage victory before Vlasov managed to get back across the gap in the final kilometre of the climb.</p>\n<p>Castrillo and Vlasov fought a give-and-take, side-by-side battle over the final 900 metres of the climb. The Russian rider eventually ceding on the steepest 20% slopes right at the top to leave Castrillo celebrating another famous victory.</p>\n<p>Further back, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) dealt another blow in the battle for the red jersey, putting yet more time into race leader Ben O&#8217;Connor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) with an attack 2km from the finish, even if he wouldn&#8217;t yet take over the lead himself.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian three-time race winner finished fifth on the stage alongside Enric Mas (Movistar), while O‚ÄôConnor limited his losses to finish in 11th place, 1:42 behind Castrillo and 38 seconds off Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>The result means that the gap at the top of the standings is now down to 43 seconds, with O‚ÄôConnor commanding an ever-decreasing lead. Mas lies in third, some distance further away at 2:23 down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s optimistic today,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said after the stage. &#8220;But I guess I&#8217;ve proven those people wrongly thought I&#8217;d lose the jersey. I had a pretty good day. It&#8217;s a bit of a shame that I exploded a bit at the end but that&#8217;s got to be probably one of the most horrible endings to a climb I&#8217;ve ever done. It was really disgusting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was kind of only one attack, and that was Primo≈æ, who was super impressive. Then it was very much man against man. You just felt like you were going nowhere, and you couldn&#8217;t see anything with the fog as well. It was rough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the lead, so OK, I&#8217;ll take it. I&#8217;m going to rest tomorrow, try and enjoy it, if I can, and then tackle Lagos de Covadonga.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 15 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a would take the riders towards another summit finish, with Cuitu Negru (18.9km at 7.4%) playing host to the climax of a 143km stage which would feature 3,800 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, two ascents of the first-category Alto de la Colladiella (6.4km at 8.2%) plus a third-category Alto de Santo Emiliano (5.6km at 4.9%) would fill out the profile, though with a long spell in the valley lying ahead of the final climb, the day would be all about Cuitu Negru.</p>\n<p>Attacks, as ever, flew from the start, with moves and countermoves coming and going as riders fought to make the break of the day. Names including Kasper Asgreen (Soudal-QuickStep), Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech), Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), and Louis Meintjes (Intermarch√©-Wanty) were all active at the front, but the kilometres ticked by without a breakaway establishing itself.</p>\n<p>As a result, the GC teams go in on the action, too, hoping to seize the occasion and cause chaos where they could.

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Pablo Castrillo (Equipo Kern Pharma) scored his second mountain stage victory of the week at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, coming out on top in a two-up battle against Aleksandr Vlasov) at the end of a thrilling final kilometre up Cuitu Negru on stage 15.</p>\n<p>The Spaniard had gone solo from the breakaway 3km from the finish line and looked set for a second solo stage victory before Vlasov managed to get back across the gap in the final kilometre of the climb.</p>\n<p>Castrillo and Vlasov fought a give-and-take, side-by-side battle over the final 900 metres of the climb. The Russian rider eventually ceding on the steepest 20% slopes right at the top to leave Castrillo celebrating another famous victory.</p>\n<p>Further back, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) dealt another blow in the battle for the red jersey, putting yet more time into race leader Ben O&#8217;Connor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) with an attack 2km from the finish, even if he wouldn&#8217;t yet take over the lead himself.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian three-time race winner finished fifth on the stage alongside Enric Mas (Movistar), while O‚ÄôConnor limited his losses to finish in 11th place, 1:42 behind Castrillo and 38 seconds off Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>The result means that the gap at the top of the standings is now down to 43 seconds, with O‚ÄôConnor commanding an ever-decreasing lead. Mas lies in third, some distance further away at 2:23 down.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s optimistic today,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said after the stage. &#8220;But I guess I&#8217;ve proven those people wrongly thought I&#8217;d lose the jersey. I had a pretty good day. It&#8217;s a bit of a shame that I exploded a bit at the end but that&#8217;s got to be probably one of the most horrible endings to a climb I&#8217;ve ever done. It was really disgusting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It was kind of only one attack, and that was Primo≈æ, who was super impressive. Then it was very much man against man. You just felt like you were going nowhere, and you couldn&#8217;t see anything with the fog as well. It was rough.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the lead, so OK, I&#8217;ll take it. I&#8217;m going to rest tomorrow, try and enjoy it, if I can, and then tackle Lagos de Covadonga.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 15 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a would take the riders towards another summit finish, with Cuitu Negru (18.9km at 7.4%) playing host to the climax of a 143km stage which would feature 3,800 metres of climbing.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, two ascents of the first-category Alto de la Colladiella (6.4km at 8.2%) plus a third-category Alto de Santo Emiliano (5.6km at 4.9%) would fill out the profile, though with a long spell in the valley lying ahead of the final climb, the day would be all about Cuitu Negru.</p>\n<p>Attacks, as ever, flew from the start, with moves and countermoves coming and going as riders fought to make the break of the day. Names including Kasper Asgreen (Soudal-QuickStep), Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech), Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), and Louis Meintjes (Intermarch√©-Wanty) were all active at the front, but the kilometres ticked by without a breakaway establishing itself.</p>\n<p>As a result, the GC teams go in on the action, too, hoping to seize the occasion and cause chaos where they could. At one point, a four-man could count red jersey contenders Ben O‚ÄôConnor, Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, and Enric Mas among its number, though the move inevitably didn‚Äôt work out.</p>\n<p>It wasn‚Äôt until the race hit the Alto de Santo Emiliano, with 60km of the stage already done, that a breakaway was finally established.

With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>Stage 15 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a brought another sprint showdown, with Kaden Groves (Alpecin-Deceuninck) prevailing over green jersey Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease A Bike) on the uphill finish in Villablino. Corbin Strong (Israel-Premier Tech) rounded out the podium at the front of the reduced peloton at the finish.</p>\n<p>Despite the stage featuring a late first-category climb, the day brought a mass bunch sprint finish, with the three sprint stage winners so far all featuring at the head of the race. Alpecin-Deceuninck had command of the head of the peloton in the closing kilometres, and so their confidence won out as the Belgian squad delivered the Australian to his second stage win of the race.</p>\n<p>While DSM-Firmenich PostNL worked hard to deliver stage 5 winner Pavel Bittner into prime position late on, the gradient to the line saw Groves and Van Aert emerge as the cream of the crop among the fast finishers.</p>\n<p>It was Groves who launched first, 150 metres from the line, with Van Aert poised to strike for a fourth stage win from the 25-year-old‚Äôs wheel. However, the points classification leader didn‚Äôt have enough power to outlast Groves on the drag to the line, almost pulling alongside his rival but not managing to do so.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúIt feels really good. I didn‚Äôt actually expect today to be as sprint as it was, but Visma controlled it. To have a man-on-man sprint against Wout is pretty awesome,‚Äù Groves said after the stage.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI think it was quite OK in the wheels [on the climb]. I thought it might be a bit hard if they start attacking but thankfully Visma rode a really high pace and no one attacked. My teammates also got over with me so we could control the finish.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúThe team did a great job. Edward again, did a good lead out, like he did in Seville, but today, I didn‚Äôt hesitate, and I think I did a really good sprint. It felt like quite a bit of a drag race against Wout but in the end, it was good enough to beat him.‚Äù</p>\n<p>There was a touch of late drama on the stage as overall contender Primo≈æ Rogliƒç (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) was forced to switch bikes on the downhill run to the finish. Luckily for the three-time winner and his team, teammate Dani Mart√≠nez was around to hand over his own bike before Rogliƒç made his way back to the peloton for the final 9km.</p>\n<p>The Slovenian finished along with the rest of the red jersey contenders ‚Äì including race leader Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) ‚Äì finished safely in the peloton, meaning the day brought no changes at the top of the overall standings. O‚ÄôConnor continues to lead the race by 1:21 from Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nStage 14 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a brought another foray into the mountains for the peloton, though not another summit finish, on the longest stage of the race ‚Äì a 200.5km run from Villafranco del Bierzo to Villablino.</p>\n<p>The first half of the stage would be marked by a long, gradual uphill run to the third-category climb of Puerto de Cerredo before a loop down into the valley. The main challenge of the day, the first-category Puerto de Leitariegos (22.8km at 4.5%), was followed by a 15km downhill run to the finish.</p>\n<p>The early kilometres of the stage were marked by masses of attacks at the front, with the first hour of racing run at an average of 50kph and no breakaway to show for the efforts of numerous riders attempting to get away.</p>\n<p>A group did eventually break clear at around the 156km to go mark. Isaac Del Toro (UAE Team Emirates) was joined in the move by Victor Campenaerts (Lotto-Dstny), Jhonatan Narv√°ez (Ineos Grenadiers), Xandro Meurisse (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Marco Frigo (Israel-Premier Tech), and Harold Tejada (Astana Qazaqstan).</p>\n<p>On the long uphill drag towards the day‚Äôs first climb, the move took over two minutes on the peloton, though with Visma-Lease A Bike taking charge behind, their advantage wouldn‚Äôt grow much larger.</p>\n<p>By the time Meurisse led the way over the peak of the Puerto de Cerredo with 98km to run, the group lay 1:40 ahead of the peloton.</p>\n<p>Little changed on the way down the long descent, though the break would lose a handful of extra seconds heading downhill. Little else changed before the riders approached the long and steady Puerto de Leitariegos, with the climb set to host the main action of the day before the finish.</p>\n<p>Up front, the breakaway, despite featuring several strong riders, looked a doomed prospect given their relatively meagre lead. Heading into the final 40km at the base of the climb, Narv√°ez sensed just that and struck out on his own.</p>\n<p>Behind him, the group split as Meurisse, Campenaerts, and Del Toro went backwards. Meanwhile, Tejada and Frigo fought on and linked up with the Ecuadorian to leave three battling on out front.</p>\n<p>At the 30km mark, however, the gap back to the peloton ‚Äì still led by Visma ‚Äì lay at just 40 seconds, and the writing was on the wall. Once again, it was up to Narv√°ez to colour the move, striking out again at 23km to go as Frigo and Tejada were caught.</p>\n<p>Narv√°ez would keep on going until the 20km to go mark, still some 3km away from the top of the climb. By that point, he was reabsorbed by the pack, which at that point numbered around 60 men.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the polka dot and green jersey leader Wout van Aert struck out at the top to grab 10 extra points towards the tally of the former competition. But there would be no GC action over the top, meaning that Visma could attempt to carry out their day‚Äôs plan in delivering Van Aert to another stage win.</p>\n<p>The descent down into Villablino was largely unremarkable, with no riders chancing their arm trying to go clear at the front. There was a moment of panic for Primo≈æ Rogliƒç, however, as his Vuelta flashed before his eyes thanks to a mechanical 15km from the finish.</p>\n<p>He quickly mounted his teammate‚Äôs bike, though, and was back in the peloton in plenty of time for the finish ‚Äì no drama, having bridged a reported 30-second gap.</p>\n<p>Then, things were left up to the sprint squads as Visma, Alpecin, and DSM sought to control the peloton on the run to the line to set the sprint up for their fast finishers. All three teams were still in the frame in the final kilometre, but in the end it was Groves vs Van Aert, with the Australian powering home and holding off his sprint rival at the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

All three teams were still in the frame in the final kilometre, but in the end it was Groves vs Van Aert, with the Australian powering home and holding off his sprint rival at the line.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=14&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"

The route will cover 3,304 kilometres and contains 52,279 metres of vertical climbing over 21 days of racing. Race organisers Unipublic have created a typically ultra-mountainous route with an opening and concluding time trial, nine summit finishes. With the exception of stage 9 through the mountains of Sierra Nevada, most of the toughest stages are concentrated in the second half of the race. </p>\n<p>While Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech) may not win often, when he does, he wins big. Today was no different at the Vuelta a Espa√±a as he launched away from the remnants of the day‚Äôs breakaway 4.8km from the line to conquer the Puerto de Ancares summit finish solo on stage 13.</p>\n<p>Thriving on the category 1 climb‚Äôs steepest gradients, the Canadian champion Woods quickly dispatched the likes of Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla) and Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) once the five remaining from a 23-strong break hit the final climb‚Äôs hardest point, winning with an eventual margin of 44 seconds.</p>\n<p>This was only the 37-year-old Woods‚Äô second win of the year after the national road title and his third at the Vuelta, adding to triumphs from 2018 and 2020.</p>\n<p>Schmid climbed to second up the sharp inclines, while Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates) managed third on another entertaining day out in front, as the breakaway won for the fourth day running at the Vuelta.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm on cloud nine right now. My big goal was to win a race with this jersey, I‚Äôve had a tough season with illness and I‚Äôve had a tough race in terms of bad luck with mechanicals and crashes in mistimed moments. This is a big moment of catharsis, a big relief,‚Äù said Woods of his stage win.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúI was lucky to get in the break with Dylan [Teuns] and Riley Sheehan, who did a great job of getting me in. I was a bit isolated when we had Jay [Vine], Brandon [McNulty] and Marc [Soler] attacking me but I just had to keep fighting with them and then when they crashed, that really scared me and I hope they are OK but then I knew I was the guy to beat on that climb.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The race for overall victory was unfolding further down the mountain after the break was allowed again to get over 10 minutes ahead, and after Movistar had paced for much of the approach to the final climb, it was Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe who came to the fore in the 7.5km.</p>\n<p>Primo≈æ Rogliƒç put his men to work with each climbing domestique emptying himself to try put race leader Ben O‚ÄôConnor (Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale) under serious pressure, with the Australian soon feeling it and dropping as the Slovenian began to power away with Enric Mas (Movistar) and Sepp Kuss (Visma-Lease a Bike).</p>\n<p>But the three-time Vuelta champion Rogliƒç showed just why he‚Äôs been so successful in Spain throughout his career, relishing the uneven, brutally steep gradients upwards of 15%, dropping all of his rivals 2.3km from the summit and powering home to gain 1:55 on O‚ÄôConnor.</p>\n<p>The Australian fought valiantly to defend red and successfully stayed in control of the jersey heading into stage 14, however, Rogliƒç is coming and he‚Äôs now well within striking distance, 1:21 down, of wrestling back the lead at the next opportunity.</p>\n<p><strong>How it unfolded</strong><br />\nDeparting the Roman walled city of Lugo in Galicia, stage 13 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a was a day primed for GC action to unfold across the 176km to the brutal summit finish up Puerto de Ancares, a climb not seen at the Vuelta since 2014 when Alberto Contador took victory.</p>\n<p>With the 6km neutral zone navigated and the flag dropped, the attacks came right away to try and get into the day‚Äôs breakaway. Those who tried were aided by the undulating start heading east out of Lugo, with the first climb up the category 3 Alto Campo de Arbre (5 km at 5.9%) solidifying a large move.</p>\n<p>What was an initial group of 18 grew to 24 strong at the head of the race, forming a formidable break of the day: Brandon McNulty, Jay Vine, Marc Soler (UAE Team Emirates), Sam Oomen (Lidl-Trek), Michael Woods, Dylan Teuns (Israel-Premier Tech), Gijs Leemreize (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL), Mikel Bizkarra (Euskaltel-Euskadi), Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike), Kim Heiduk (Ineos Grenadiers), Kasper Asgreen (T-Rex Quick-Step), Kaden Groves, Luca Vergallito (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Victor Campenaerts, Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto Dstny), Mauro Schmid (Jayco AlUla), Simon Guglielmi, Mathis Le Berre (Ark√©-B&#038;B Hotels), Enzo Leijnse (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL), Ruben Fernandez (Cofidis), Julius van den Berg (DSM-Firmenich-PostNL), Jos√© Felix Parra (Kern Pharma), Nicolas Vinokourov (Astana Qazaqstan) and Xabier Isasa (Euskatel-Euskadi).</p>\n<p>The breakaway fell to 23 with 120km to go as Isasa lost contact and dropped back to the peloton.</p>\n<p>This huge group would build out their lead to 11 minutes once the second climb of the day, Alto O Portelo (7.7 km at 5.1%), was completed, with the powerful trio of Van Aert, Vine and Soler getting a small 16-second gap over the top of the climb as the Belgian took the KOM points.</p>\n<p>With his eight-point haul from the first two climbs, Van Aert, the current leader of the green points classification, also moved into the virtual lead of the King of the Mountains classification ahead of Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates). The trio then dropped back into the break.</p>\n<p>Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale rode on the front of the peloton but the gap to the break only kept extending, eventually passing the 15-minute mark as the race turned back on itself and began heading northwest for the final 50km approach to Puerto de Ancares.</p>\n<p>There was a sudden Belgian acceleration with 46km to go, as Campenarts and Van Aert were joined by Schmid and Gugliemi in a move off the front of the 23-rider group and built a 15-second advantage quickly.</p>\n<p>The Frenchman couldn‚Äôt hold the pace as the soon-to-be-teammates Van Aert and Campenaerts continued to work in front, with Alpecin chasing behind for Groves as the intermediate sprint approached. </p>\n<p>UAE Team Emirates made sure they weren‚Äôt missing out as Soler, Vine and McNulty all made the junction to the leading trio, alongside the other strongest climbers in the break of the day, Woods, Schmid, Leemreize, Oomen and Asgreen. With Campenaerts dropped, this left nine in front for the final 30km.</p>\n<p>Behind, despite the 16-minute deficit, things were happening as Movistar took control for Mas in the peloton, showing their intentions of backing their man up the final 7.5km climb.</p>\n<p>On the descent to the far-from-easy warm-up climb to the summit finish, Puerto de Lumeras (6.6 km at 5.9%), Soler lost contact, perhaps paying for his efforts having been in the break for several days. But UAE weren‚Äôt concerned as with 25km to go, Vine launched his move.</p>\n<p>Woods made the most effort in pursuit, quickly closing the gap on the category 2 climb with McNulty in his wheel before UAE continued to use their numbers with the recovered Soler, who launched a double burst ahead of the crest on the penultimate climb. </p>\n<p>That was until Van Aert took the maximum KOM points haul to extend his lead before stopping his effort at the top and starting the descent. </p>\n<p>It was a descent that then changed the race massively as McNulty and Vine came down at high speed in a corner, the former thankfully sliding under and not into the metal barrier and into the bushes, emerging safe and able to stand albeit with lots of cuts. Vine didn‚Äôt actually hit the deck but crashed into the barrier before hobbling away and getting onto a new bike. </p>\n<p>With five men, Van Aert, Soler, Schmid, Woods and Oomen left in front, the battle for the stage win up the brutally steep 7.5km climb didn‚Äôt start properly until 5.1km to go, with the Swiss and Canadian champions launching out of the group.</p>\n<p>Quickly it became apparent that Woods was the strongest left as expected, dropping Schmid on the stinging 15% gradients of the climb and going solo 4.8km from the crest and the finish line. </p>\n<p>Movistar continued to pace the peloton behind some 16 minutes down the road, however, they were soon replaced by Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, who started a huge lead-out for their leader Rogliƒç.</p>\n<p>O‚ÄôConnor had already started slipping back as he likes of Aleksandr Vlasov and Dani Mart√≠nez emptied themselves for the Slovenian who soon launched with only Mas and Kuss able to follow initially.</p>\n<p>But soon they blew up and paid for attempting to follow him, with the former three-time Vuelta winner kicking on to gain big time on all his rivals, including the race leader who‚Äôs deficit he more than halved.</p>\n<p>Mikel Landa (Soudal-QuickStep) was the next best behind Rogliƒç but even he was 35 seconds down at the line atop the brutal climb which shaped the makeup of the Vuelta‚Äôs overall standings massively heading into the final eight stages.</p>\n<p><strong>Results : </strong><br />\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" scrolling=\"yes\" frameborder=\"0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\" src=\"https://firstcycling.com/widget/?r=23&#038;y=2024&#038;s=13&#038;lang=EN&amp;cn=1\"></iframe></p>\n"
